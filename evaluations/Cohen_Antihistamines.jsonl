Skin reactions obtained with this method can be recorded with laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and previous studies with this method have shown histamine-induced laser Doppler changes in the wheal area. Objective: In order to compare the influence of two H1 receptor antagonists (cetirizine 10 mg vs. ebastine 10 mg) on the skin vascular responses to histamine introduced by iontophoresis, we designed a double-blind, randomized, two-period crossover trial in which 18 volunteers were randomized. Methods: Before and 2, 5 and 7 h after drug administration, iontophoresis (30 s, 1.4 mA/cm2) of histamine 10% was performed and followed by (1) monitoring of skin vascular responses with LDF at the administration site and at 1 cm from it, and (2) wheal and flare area measurements. Results: 2, 5 and 7 h after intake of the antihistaminic drug, there were significant differences between both drugs. Concerning LDF recordings, we noted at the histamine administration site an increase in perfusion unit (PU) values which is an effect known to be in proportion to the degree of inhibition of wheal reaction, and at 1 cm distal to the histamine administration site, there was a decrease in PU values. These changes were more marked under cetirizine. A greater suppressive effect of cetirizine on the wheal and flare reaction was consistently observed at all time points during the study, demonstrating its superior efficacy. Conclusion: We conclude that (1) cetirizine demonstrated a stronger antihistaminic effect compared to ebastine at all time points; (2) iontophoresis appears to be an appropriate method to study specific microvascular changes at the delivery site of histamine and hence to detect the earliest changes occurring at the site of agonist-antagonist competition in the skin.", "outbound_citations": ["8527154", "8187504", "7907893", "8099818", "8274778", "1283698", "1683840", "2288898", "2574115", "2905150", "2908486", "7351489", "552299"], "inbound_citations": ["29723372", "27307292", "22253335", "21070791", "19318525", "17359390", "24672131", "15841664", "14977391"], "label": "1"}

Design: Randomised, double blind, parallel group comparison. Setting: Four outpatient general medicine and allergy clinics in Switzerland and Germany. Participants: 131 patients were screened for seasonal allergic rhinitis and 125 patients were randomised (butterbur 61; cetirizine 64). Interventions: Butterbur (carbon dioxide extract tablets, ZE 339) one tablet, four times daily, or cetirizine, one tablet in the evening, both given for two consecutive weeks. Main outcome measures: Scores on SF-36 questionnaire and clinical global impression scale. Results: Improvement in SF-36 score was similar in the two treatment groups for all items tested hierarchically. Butterbur and cetirizine were also similarly effective with regard to global improvement scores on the clinical global impression scale (median score 3 in both groups). Both treatments were well tolerated. In the cetirizine group, two thirds (8/12) of reported adverse events were associated with sedative effects (drowsiness and fatigue) despite the drug being considered a non-sedating antihistamine. Conclusions: The effects of butterbur are similar to those of cetirizine in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis when evaluated blindly by patients and doctors. Butterbur should be considered for treating seasonal allergic rhinitis when the sedative effects of antihistamines need to be avoided. What is already known on this topic Seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) is common in countries with temperate climates. Most patients have their symptoms treated for short periods, particularly during peaks in atmospheric pollen count What this study adds After two weeks, the effects of butterbur and cetirizine were comparable in patients with hay fever Butterbur produced fewer sedating effects than cetirizine Butterbur should be considered when the sedating effects of antihistamines must be avoided", "outbound_citations": ["11286996", "11159568", "10968813", "9342764", "8757208", "7938265", "8064070", "8302945", "1701029", "2453545", "3587055", "PMC27467", "PMC26589"], "inbound_citations": ["36691524", "36088156", "35427728", "35062310", "33768322", "33668395", "33849430", "33023328", "32801463", "32104974", "31762379", "31631423", "33082668", "29341029", "28622417", "27884625", "28501226", "27451267", "27211328", "25943958", "26760413", "25269403", "24679731", "24324897", "23764820", "23764810", "23132561", "22809670", "21922427", "19641087", "20816182", "20540482", "20493338", "19827027", "19504468", "20626052", "19770483", "19262383", "18348887", "18331513", "18219828", "20477187", "17545337", "17994396", "16670510", "16376470", "16675332", "16751170", "16784008", "16213915", "16114089", "15967894", "20477659", "16035564", "15784105", "16520304", "15611396", "15576893", "15330009", "15281472", "15196288", "15186559", "15005760", "15080820", "15005644", "14978350", "14501441", "12859442", "12757449"], "label": "0"}

Allergic activity was determined through RAST inhibition and skin prick test. Quantification of the principal allerten (Alt a 1) was performed through the 2-site binding assay, with a mean content of 34.2 ng Alt a 1/micro g protein. The parameters analyzed were the symptom-medication score, skin prick using the end-point technique, specific bronchial challenge test, peak flow, total and specific IgE and IgG4. Nineteen patiens received active treatment with oral immunotherapy and another 19 received symptomatic treatment. The initial phase of immunotherapy lasted 3 months until the maximum dose was reached. This was maintained for 12 months; the mean accumulated dos was 280,000 PNU. Significant differences were found in reduction in the symptom-medication score in the treated group after 12 months of immunotherapy. No differences were found in the control group. Immunotherapy was well tolerated with 0.42 adverse reactions per 100 doses administered. All adverse reactions were mild-to-moderate. In the treated group, papule size was significantly reduced. Values for the specific bronchial challenge test, expressed through PD20, were significantly higher in the immunotherapy group. Peak flow showed no changes in either group. Values of IgG4 were significantly higher in the immunotherapy group. Total and specific IgE levels showed no significant changes in either group. In conclusion, oral immunotherapy with Alternaria extract is clinically effective in pediatric patients. In general, the therapy was well tolerated.

Good evidence supports use of antihistamines, nasal steroid sprays, and immunotherapy. Fewer trials have been done on the new antileukotrienes.\n\n\nMAIN MESSAGE\nAllergic rhinitis causes significant morbidity, which can be successfully treated. Newer antihistamines, developed to replace terfenadine and astemizole which have potential side effects, include loratadine, cetirizine, and the newest, fexofenadine. Intranasal steroid sprays are also effective, particularly for people with nasal stuffiness. One study showed some growth retardation in children using beclomethasone over a prolonged period (1 year). The newer steroid sprays, such as fluticasone, budesonide, and mometasone furoate aqueous, however, have not been studied in the same way and are usually recommended for shorter periods. The newest group of medications showing real promise are the antileukotrienes, including zafirlukast and montelukast. Taken orally, these medications avoid the discomfort of nasal sprays and seem to have few side effects. Immunotherapy offers a new option: a short-course, preseasonal series of six to 11 injections that reduces the burden on patients for year-round therapy. Combinations of these therapies are also possible.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWith new medications and immunotherapy options, family physicians can offer effective treatment to patients with allergic rhinitis.", "outbound_citations": ["9389286", "9257783", "8977506", "8819509", "9011329", "8655886", "7767514", "7728690", "7771342", "1464044", "3312669", "1433698", "8871736"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Understanding the many possible causes is the first step in assessing urticaria. Allergic and drug-induced urticaria respond to removal of the cause. The physical urticarias, particularly delayed pressure urticaria and also urticarial vasculitis, require separate consideration. For the majority of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, nonsedating antihistamines are the mainstay of treatment. There are several to choose from, including cetirizine, astemizole, loratadine, terfenadine and acrivastine, each with its own pharmacokinetics and antiallergic properties. When these fail, histamine H2-antagonists may help either alone or in combination with H1-antagonists. Older sedative antihistamines are still useful. Ketotifen, oxatomide and azelastine have mast cell stabilising effects that are considered an advantage in treating these disorders. Second-line therapies include a wide range of drugs such as doxepin, dapsone, attenuated androgens, calcium antagonists, antimalarials, gold and methotrexate. The most effective and regularly used second-line agents are corticosteroids. These are best limited to short term crisis management, except in severe recalcitrant cases, and in patients with pressure urticaria or urticarial vasculitis. Recent work on circulating histamine releasing autoantibodies suggests that there is scope for more aggressive immunosuppression in selected patients.

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE database search was completed to identify relevant articles including reviews, recent studies and abstracts, and data from Parke-Davis. STUDY SELECTION: Due to the small number of published human studies available, some data are derived from animal studies and abstracts of human studies. Studies and abstracts chosen summarize the clinical action of troglitazone in healthy volunteers, in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, and in patients with diabetes mellitus. Three of the six published human studies used subjects in a placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized environment (type 2 diabetic patients or obese subjects with insulin resistance). DATA EXTRACTION: All clinical trials available, including unpublished reports, were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Troglitazone is the first member of a new class of medications, the thiazolidinediones, to be approved for clinical use. Troglitazone increases insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and in hepatic and adipose tissue. It has been shown to decrease hepatic glucose output while having no effect on stimulating insulin secretion from the pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Its metabolic effects decrease fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia, insulin concentrations, and triglyceride concentrations, while increasing high-density lipoprotein concentrations. There is some evidence, based on short-term trials, that troglitazone causes only minimal decreases in glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) concentrations. Data suggest that troglitazone decreases impaired glucose tolerance in nondiabetic obese subjects and leads to a reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Troglitazone has a mild adverse effect profile, with rare instances of abnormal liver function tests. CONCLUSIONS: Troglitazone appears to be a safe, effective, and useful new agent in the treatment of insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, although its HbA1C-lowering effects have been minimal in short-term trials, and its insulin dosage-reduction activity remains unclear. The Food and Drug Administration has also approved its use as monotherapy and in combination with sulfonylureas for patients with type 2 diabetes. It may have use in the treatment of patients with impaired glucose tolerance, but more clinical experience is needed before definitive conclusions can be made. The role of troglitazone therapy in diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose intolerance will continue to evolve as the results of studies and our clinical experience with this agent become available. OBJETIVO: Introducir un nuevo agente antidiab\u00e9tico llamado troglitazona (CS-045 o Rezul\u00edn) y discutir su farmacolog\u00eda, uso terap\u00e9utico, farmacocin\u00e9tica, dosificaci\u00f3n, reacci\u00f3nes adversas, interacci\u00f3n con otras drogas, y eficacia cl\u00ednica. FUENTES DE INFORMACI\u00d3N: Se realiz\u00f3 una busqueda a trav\u00e9s del banco de datos de MEDLINE con el prop\u00f3sito de identificar art\u00edculos relevantes como repasos, estudios recientes, extractos, y datos obtenidos de la compa\u00f1\u00eda Parke-Davis. SELECCI\u00d3N DE ESTUDIOS: Dada al peque\u00f1o n\u00famero de estudios disponibles en humanos, algunos datos fueron derivados de estudios en animales y extractos de estudios en humanos. Los estudios y extractos seleccionados resumen la actividad cl\u00ednica de troglitazona en voluntarios saludables, sujetos con intolerancia a glucosa y pacientes con diabetes. Tres de los seis estudios publicados en humanos fueron conducidos de una manera aleatoria, multicentro, y controlados con placebo (pacientes con diabetes tipo 2 y en personas obesas con resistencia a la insulina). M\u00c9TODO DE EXTRACCI\u00d3N DE INFORMACI\u00d3N: Se revisaron todos los estudios cl\u00ednicos disponibles, incluyendo reportes no publicados. S\u00cdNTESIS: Troglitazona es el primer miembro de una nueva clase de medicamentos llamados tiazolidindiones que fue aprobado para uso cl\u00ednico. Troglitazona aumenta la sensitividad de insulina en el m\u00fasculo esquel\u00e9tico y en el tejido hep\u00e1tico y adiposo. Se ha demostrado que este medicamento dismunuye el gasto hep\u00e1tico de glucosa mientras que no produce efecto estimulativo en la secreci\u00f3n de insulina de las c\u00e9lulas pancre\u00e1ticas beta. Sus efectos metab\u00f3licos producen una disminuci\u00f3n en las concentraciones de glucosa en ayuna postprandial y en los niveles de insulina y triglic\u00e9ridos, mientras que aumenta los niveles de lipoprote\u00edna de altadensidad. Evidencia de estudios de corta duraci\u00f3n indican que troglitazona causa solamente una m\u00ednima disminuci\u00f3n en los niveles de hemoglobina glucosilada A1C (HbA1C). Informaci\u00f3n adicional sugiere que troglitazona disminuye la intolerancia a glucosa en sujetos obesos no-diab\u00e9ticos y reduce la presi\u00f3n sist\u00f3lica y diast\u00f3lica en pacientes hipertensos con diabetes tipo 2. Troglitazona tiene un perfil moderado en sus reacci\u00f3nes adversas y produce raras occurencias de anormalidades en las pruebas de funci\u00f3n hep\u00e1tica. CONCLUSIONES: Troglitazona parece ser un nuevo agente seguro, efficaz y \u00fatil en el tratamiento de pacientes con diabetes de tipo 2 que requieren insulina pero su actividad en reducir los niveles de HbA1C reportados en estudios de corta duraci\u00f3n es m\u00ednimo y su capacidad en reducir las dosis de insulina necesitan ser aclaradas. La Administraci\u00f3n de Alimentos y Drogas tambi\u00e9n aprob\u00f3 su uso como monoterapia y en combinaci\u00f3n con sulfonilureas para pacientes con diabetes tipo 2. Podr\u00e1 ser usado en pacientes con intolerancia a glucosa pero se necesita m\u00e1s experiencia cl\u00ednica antes que se pueda hacer conclusiones definitivas. El papel de troglitazona en el tratamiento de la diabetes y la intolerancia a glucosa continuar\u00e1 desarrollando cuando los resultados de estudios y nuestra experiencia cl\u00ednica con \u00e9ste agente se hagan disponibles.

REVUE DE LITT\u00c9RATURE: Une recherche informatis\u00e9e de type MEDLINE fut effectu\u00e9e pour localiser des articles pertinents incluant des articles de r\u00e9vision, des \u00e9tudes r\u00e9centes, et des donn\u00e9es provenant de chez la compagnie Parke-Davis. S\u00c9LECTION DES \u00c9TUDES: \u00c0 cause du petit nombre d'\u00e9tudes humaines publi\u00e9es disponibles, certaines donn\u00e9es sont obtenues \u00e0 partir d'\u00e9tudes animales ou de r\u00e9sum\u00e9s d'\u00e9tudes humaines. Les \u00e9tudes et les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s tracent un sommaire des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s cliniques du troglitazone chez le volontaire sain, chez le volontaire avec intol\u00e9rance au glucose, et chez le volontaire avec un diab\u00e8te mellitus. Trois des six \u00e9tudes humaines publi\u00e9es \u00e0 date sont des \u00e9tudes contr\u00f4l\u00e9es avec placebo, multicontriques, randomis\u00e9es avec des patients diab\u00e9tiques de type II ou des patients ob\u00e8ses avec une r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 l'insuline. S\u00c9LECTION DE L'INFORMATION: Toutes les \u00e9tudes cliniques disponibles compris les \u00e9tudes non publi\u00e9es, furent utilis\u00e9es. R\u00c9SUM\u00c9: Le troglitazone est le premier agent d'une nouvelle classe de m\u00e9dicaments, les thiazolidinediones, qui doit \u00eatre approuv\u00e9 pour utilisation clinique. Le troglitazone augmente la sensibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'insuline des muscles stri\u00e9s, des tissus adipeux, et h\u00e9patiques. Des \u00e9tudes ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il diminue la production du glucose h\u00e9patique m\u00eame si il n'a aucun effet de stimulation de s\u00e9cr\u00e9tion d'insuline sur les cellules-\u03b2 du pancr\u00e9as. Ses effets m\u00e9taboliques diminuent l'hyperglyc\u00e9mie \u00e0 jeun et postprandiale, les niveaux d'insuline, et de triglyc\u00e9rides (TG) et augmentent les niveaux de lipoprot\u00e9ine de densit\u00e9 haute (LDH). Selon certaines \u00e9vidences, se basant sur des \u00e9tudes de courte dur\u00e9e, le troglitazone diminue peu les niveaux d'h\u00e9moglobine glycosyl\u00e9e A1C (HbA1C). Des donn\u00e9es sugg\u00e8rent que le troglitazone diminue l'intol\u00e9rance au glucose chez les ob\u00e8ses non diab\u00e9tiques et permet une r\u00e9duction des pressions systolique et diastolique chez des diab\u00e9tiques de type II hypertendus. Le troglitazone a un profil d'effets ind\u00e9sirables tr\u00e8s avantageux. Quelquefois les tests de la fonction h\u00e9patique sont alt\u00e9r\u00e9s. CONCLUSIONS: Le troglitazone semble \u00eatre un nouvel agent s\u00e9curitaire, efficace, et utile pour les diab\u00e9tiques de type II qui n\u00e9cessitent un traitement \u00e0 l'insuline m\u00eame si ses effets sur l'HbA1C sont minimaux lors des \u00e9tudes \u00e0 courte dur\u00e9e et que son m\u00e9canisme d'action pour r\u00e9duire l'utilisation de l'insuline, reste n\u00e9buleux. L'utilisation du troglitazone a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par l'Administration des Drogues et Alimentaires en monoth\u00e9rapie et en th\u00e9rapie combin\u00e9e avec les sulfonylurees chez les diab\u00e9tiques de type II. Il pourra peut-\u00eatre \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 chez les patients avec intol\u00e9rance au glucose mais une plus grande exp\u00e9rience clinique est n\u00e9cessaire pour s'en assurer. Le r\u00f4le du troglitazone dans le traitement du diab\u00e8te de Type II et dans le traitement de l'intolerance au glucose se d\u00e9veloppe encore \u00e0 mesure que de nouvelles \u00e9tudes sont r\u00e9alis\u00e9es et \u00e0 mesure que notre exp\u00e9rience clinique avec cet agent s'accumule.", "outbound_citations": ["9032099", "9118772", "9118771", "8922349", "8897863", "8784087", "8667232", "8718436", "12502616", "8786734", "7587918", "7794582", "7847366", "7958495", "7935664", "7935656", "7956951", "7508875", "8247074", "8366922", "8462395", "8427865", "8518453", "1547676", "1797492", "1943750", "2120548", "2407581", "2192853", "1967567", "2758951", "2657323", "3053303", "3934850", "6384267", "7287908", "382871", "814810", "20997109"], "inbound_citations": ["29447191", "23134541", "22201515", "20735405", "18755353", "16194123", "14634802", "10644077"], "label": "0"}

The effects of age, sex, dose, duration of treatment, and the interaction with P450 inhibitor drugs were also examined.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe carried out a cohort study with a nested case-control analysis using the UK-based General Practice Research database (GPRD). The study cohort included persons aged less than 80 years old who received their first prescription for any of the five study drugs between January 1, 1992 and September 30, 1996. We estimated relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias with current use of antihistamines as compared with non use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study cohort included 197425 persons who received 513012 prescriptions. Over the study period 18 valid cases of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias were detected. Nine occurred during the current use of any antihistamine, resulting in a crude incidence of 1.9 per 10000 person-years (95%CI: 1.0-3.6) and a relative risk of 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5-11.8) as compared with non use. Astemizole presented the highest relative risk (RR= 19.0; 95%CI: 4.8-76.0) of all study drugs, while terfenadine (RR=2.1; 95%CI:0.5-8.5) was in the range of other nonsedating antihistamines. Older age was associated with a greater risk of ventricular arrhythmias (RR=7.4; 95%CI: 2.6-21.4) and seemed to increase the effect of antihistamines (RR=6.4; 95%CI: 1.7-24.8). The proportions of high dose terfenadine and the concomitant use with P450 inhibitors among current users of terfenadine were 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively over the study period with no single case of ventricular arrhythmias occurring in the presence of these two risk factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of nonsedating antihistamines increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias by a factor of four in the general population. Yet, the absolute effect is quite low requiring 57000 prescriptions, or 5300 person-years of use for one case to occur. The risk associated with terfenadine was no different from that with other nonsedating antihistamines.", "outbound_citations": ["9343494", "9349397", "9271355", "9142080", "8725389", "8750398", "7606309", "7614779", "7913608", "8109548", "8100494", "1920744", "1676921", "2021768", "2900995", "2868774", "2857636", "1977935", "PMC1670151", "8445816", "1322467", "PMC1873548", "9643612", "PMC1669537", "PMC1339646", "2905156", "8614120"], "inbound_citations": ["34233316", "34225211", "32511357", "31519068", "29745425", "30123067", "28831527", "27698831", "27009554", "26013175", "25785934", "25292435", "25168256", "24262692", "24455199", "23694701", "24672890", "22244872", "21346598", "20647490", "20221588", "20202356", "20647490", "19225450", "20021986", "18613261", "18574462", "18049301", "17632534", "17632535", "17506855", "16869820", "16291479", "16141657", "15824553", "15746880", "15655517", "15534787", "15206997", "12885102"], "label": "1"}

The kinetics were followed in plasma and urine and evaluated by individual kinetic modelling as well as by a nonparametric population kinetic method.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA two-compartment model adequately described the disposition of (+)RS-MQ. CL/F was 6.5 +/- 1.8 l h(-1), V(ss)/F 815 +/- 165 l, and k 0.0081 +/- 0.0023 h(-1). The kinetics of (-)SR-MQ were time- and/or concentration dependent with a lower oral clearance (0.92 +/- 0.25 vs 2.14 +/- 0.63 l h(-1), 95% CI for the difference 0.86-1.60 l h(-1)) and a longer half-life (345 vs 185 h, 95% CI for the difference 47-291 h) after the last dose compared with the first dose. Clearance of (+)RS-MQ and (-)SR-MQ was significantly correlated within subjects (r = 0.69, P < 0.05). Urinary recovery of unchanged substance was 8.7% for (+)RS-MQ and 12.3% for (-)SR-MQ. The elimination of MMQ was disposition rate-limited and not determined by its rate of formation. Poor metabolizers of debrisoquine did not differ from extensive metabolizers in the kinetics of any compound.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe MQ enantiomers differ extensively in their disposition both with regard to parameter values and the kinetic stability over time during repeated dosing with racemic MQ.

After a standardized history and physical examination, patients were randomized into treatment with either loratadine (10 mg/day for 3 days) or prednisolene (50 mg/day for 3 days). All patients were followed up until complete remission. Most patients suffered from moderate (42%) to severe (40%) disease. Possible eliciting factors were identified in less than 50% of the cases. Associated upper respiratory tract infections were found most commonly (39.5%), followed by possibly eliciting drugs, mostly analgesics (9.2%) and suspected food intolerance (0.9%). The course of the disease was self-limited in all cases, the longest episode lasting for 3 weeks. Both treatment regimens were effective in controlling whealing, but in corticosteroid-treated patients, symptoms ceased earlier, with complete remission occurring within 3 days of treatment in 93.8%, compared to 65.9% of patients treated with loratadine (p < 0.001).

Thirty\u2010four patients were randomly allocated to the active group, and 32 received placebo. Immunotherapy consisted of olive\u2010allergen extracts (Stallergenes SA) administered sublingually pre\u2010 and coseasonally from January to July for 2 consecutive years. Serial concentrations from 1 to 300 IR were used up to the maintenance dose of 20 drops of 300 IR daily. The cumulative dose for each patient was 300 times higher than in parenteral immunotherapy, and the cumulative dose of the major allergen Ole e 1 was 8.1 mg/2 years. The patients were assessed by clinical parameters (symptom and medication scores from patients' daily diaries) and immunologic measurements (specific IgE. lgG4. eosinophil cationic protein [ECP]) were performed. The actively treated patients had a significantly lower score for dyspnea (P<0.04 during the first season; P<0.03 during the second season). At the poUinic peak during the second year, a lower score of conjunctivitis was recorded (P<0.05) in the actively treated patients. The analysis of intragroup evolution showed that the total score of rhinitis increased significantly during the pollinic peak in the group under placebo, whereas there was no symptomatic peak for the same period in the group under active treatment. However, the difference between the groups was not significant. The medication score did not differ significantly between the groups. Oral steroids were the only variables with a P value near the significance level (P=0.06) in favor of the actively treated group. A significant decrease in skin reactivity was recorded in the active group after 2 years of treatment. No significant variation in specific IgE and IgG4 was detected. A significantly lower level of serum ECP was observed at the pollinic peak in the actively treated patients during the first pollen season (P=0.01), but this was not confirmed the second year when the ECP levels doubled in both groups without correlation to the clinical findings. Tolerance was excellent with only a few minor side\u2010effects reported.

Using a randomized, double\u2010blind, crossover design in 19 patients, a combination of cetirizine (10 mg at night) and ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) was compared with a combination of cetirizine (10 mg at night) and placebo. The addition of ranitidine did not produce any significant difference in linear analogue scores for weal, Itch or sleep disturbance. There was a significant depression of the frictional force/wealing response curve with an increase in wealing threshold (P<0.0001) following the addition of H2 blockade. The wealing threshold was 54.7 \u00b1 4.4 (mean \u00b1 SEM) g/mm2 for the H1 antagonist alone, and 73.2 \u00b1 5.7 for the combination of H1 and H2 antagonists. In a second similar study involving nine different patients, comparing terfenadine (120 mg twice daily) with a combination of terfenadine and ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), the weal threshold was 59.8 \u00b1 6.6 for the H1 antagonist alone, and 73.0 \u00b1 6.4 for the combination of H1 and H2 antagonists. Thus, in dermographic urticaria, adding an H2 antagonist to treatment with a potent H1 antagonist gives a small, significant reduction in wealing response, but no symptomatic benefit. We conclude that involvement of the H2 receptor in this urticarial disease is minimal, and does not justify the use of H2 receptor antagonists.", "outbound_citations": ["8095760", "1977781", "2107240", "2574553", "2959719", "2428901", "2430410", "2861221", "3922395", "6148648", "6419768", "6139191", "6132569", "6129316", "6192652", "7011357", "6101337", "475988", "32486"], "inbound_citations": ["36808444", "35850790", "35538735", "32473421", "29796863", "29527019", "27942227", "26239325", "24766875", "24262692", "23282382", "22419335", "12004303", "21699121", "21778816", "20666769", "20203466", "19772513", "25164630", "18172439", "18091593", "16436141", "14524269"], "label": "0"}

Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing lung function changes under repeated use of antihistamine in adult asthma were selected, and the quality of studies was scored. Morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was the primary outcome: an effect size was computed for each study, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and a mean effect size was computed, combining all studies. Effect sizes were also determined for secondary outcomes: evening PEFR, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and daily use of inhaled beta-agonists. Nineteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Mean quality score of studies was 59.4%; asthma was generally uncontrolled at study inclusion. Altogether, 582 antihistamine-treated and 557 placebo-treated asthma patients were evaluable. Antihistamines had little effect on airway calibre (mean increase in morning PEFR: 13 L x min(-1); 95 CI: 8-18 L x min(-1)) and on use of inhaled beta-agonists (mean reduction in daily use: 0.4 doses; 95% CI: 0-0.8 doses). Sedation occurred more often with antihistamines than with placebo (p<0.001); additional side-effects were mentioned, including weight gain, altered taste, headache and dry mouth.

A 28-day screening period, including a 5-day baseline period, preceded a 4-week treatment period. Reduction in rhinitis symptom scores was evident in both groups as early as day 1, with no significant between-group differences during week 1.

There was no significant between-group difference in relief from postnasal drip at any time point. Physicians' global evaluations significantly (P = 0.002) favored triamcinolone acetonide at the final visit, with moderate to complete relief of symptoms attained by 68% of triamcinolone acetonide patients and 59% of loratadine patients.

Nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching as well as ocular clinical signs were characterized using a symptom score. Desloratadine tablet was administered in 5 mg doses. After two weeks of treatment, the symptom score was re-evaluated. Potential adverse events that had occurred during the treatment period were recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDesloratadine significantly alleviated all four nasal symptoms and ocular effectively. In particular, treatment resulted from 76 percent to 12% percent decrease of overall symptom score. One of the participants discontinued treatment due to the occurrence of adverse effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results demonstrate that desloratidine is a safe and effective systemic antihistamine--with complex antiallergic effect--for the therapy of seasonal allergic rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of betahistine (an H3-receptor blocker with partial H1- and H2-agonism) on the dynamics of the cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction. The skin blister technique was used to collect inflammatory cells after intradermal (i.d.) administration of grass pollen antigen, histamine and betahistine to 11 atopic volunteers. In this open, cross-over study, volunteers were randomly allocated to five treatment protocols i.e. (a) histamine 1 microgram i.d.; (b) betahistine 57, 114 and 285 micrograms i.d.; (c) i.d. grass pollen antigen; (d) (c) plus oral betahistine; (e) (c) plus oral betahistine, cetirizine, (H1-blocker) and cimetidine (H2-blocker). Blister fluid containing cells were collected on microscope slides at 6 and 24 h after i.d. injections. The areas of the wheal and flare and of induration were measured, respectively, at 0.25, and, 1, 6 and 24 h. Combined oral therapy with cetirizine, cimetidine and betahistine reduced the area of grass pollen-induced induration significantly at all time periods, but caused a significant increase in eosinophil and neutrophil vacuolisation during the late phase reaction. This did not occur with orally administered betahistine alone. Intradermal betahistine induced significantly more neutrophil and eosinophil vacuolization than histamine and, in contrast to the latter, also mediated a concentration-dependent late phase induration. The results of this study suggest that the H3-receptor regulates a feedback system in conjunction with that previously proven for the H2-receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "outbound_citations": ["7680056", "1382132", "34167203", "2172348", "2574731", "2469708", "2546304", "2685821", "2990946", "6235726", "6224442", "6125535", "6160172", "7437642", "6821510", "927519", "450", "4936278", "4929225", "4166130"], "inbound_citations": ["36254926", "29159693"], "label": "0"}

We assessed the yield of examination of the entire skin, in addition to examination of intentionally shown skin lesions, in people attending melanoma screening clinics in southern Limburg, the Netherlands, in 1993. Of the 4146 attenders, 2910 (70%) showed a specific skin spot. Additional examination of the entire skin was offered to 1385 people. There were 1221 evaluable cases. Fourteen presumptive diagnoses of malignancies were encountered: seven malignant melanomas, all with low clinical suspicion, and seven basal cell carcinomas. Histology revealed three basal cell carcinomas. No malignant melanomas were confirmed by histology. It is concluded that additional total skin examination during screening for malignant melanoma is not worthwhile, except perhaps for persons presenting lesions that are suspicious of melanoma or dysplastic naevi.", "outbound_citations": ["7601947", "7726583", "7804994", "8790483", "1392110", "1504936", "1301035", "1802899", "2007674", "1985718", "2273109", "2189362", "2295061", "2703058", "2644314", "2449014", "3346406", "3711396", "3958271", "600174"], "inbound_citations": ["33891852", "33671417", "25956208", "25145574", "25207363", "22517033", "22911184", "19522711", "18752818", "17919714", "16445771", "16112344"], "label": "0"}

Participants received oral loratadine (10 or 20 mg), methysergide (4 or 8 mg), or placebo at 1000 and 1700 hours daily. Active drug was administered on Days 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, and 16; placebo was administered on all other days. Drug and dose order were counterbalanced across participants. Food intake, performance, and subjective ratings were measured repeatedly throughout the day. Loratadine had no effect on food intake, performance, or subjective ratings. In contrast, total caloric intake significantly decreased from approximately 3500 kcal during placebo administration to 3065 kcal on the first but not the second day of methysergide administration. Consumption of carbohydrate (p < 0.055), protein, and fat decreased on the first day of methysergide administration. This decrease in food intake was due to a decrease in meal size; the number of meals consumed was not affected. The proportion of calories derived from carbohydrates significantly increased on the first day of methysergide administration. Methysergide also significantly impaired performance of a psychomotor task on the first day of high-dose administration and increased ratings of several subjective measures, including \"Vomiting,\" \"Stomach Pain,\" and \"Miserable.\" These results suggest that the anorectic effect occurred as a result of the somatic and mood changes produced by methysergide. In addition, the inability of loratadine to affect food intake indicates that antagonism of central histamine receptors may be responsible for the increases in food intake produced by other antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine).", "outbound_citations": ["9284505", "8937620", "8838609", "8577886", "8067592", "7913125", "8107459", "8234027", "1504160", "1594690", "1734669", "1461626", "1890629", "2150377", "2243896", "3193258", "2892538", "3226529", "2885862", "2874769", "2943219", "3963801", "6706460", "6646394", "4762224", "9285847", "5120086", "14462919"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Our aim is to evaluate whether responsiveness to leukotriene receptor antagonists was determined by expression of the variant (C) or wild-type (A) polymorphism of this enzyme.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe carried out a retrospective analysis of 8 randomised, placebo-controlled trials performed in our department in mild-to-moderate asthmatics. In all trials, effect of leukotriene receptor antagonist was compared to placebo, where the primary outcome was bronchial hyperresponsiveness to adenosine monophosphate or methacholine. Secondary outcomes were forced expiratory volume in 1 second, exhaled nitric oxide and peripheral blood eosinophils.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor the primary outcome of attenuation of bronchial hyperresponsiveness by leukotriene receptor antagonist vs placebo, there were significant effects within each genotype on adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (n = 78): 2.21 and 2.07-fold improvements for AA and AC/CC, respectively; while for methacholine (n = 81) there were 1.39 and 1.36-fold improvements, respectively. There were no significant differences between genotypes (i.e. AA vs AC/CC): geometric mean fold-differences of 1.07 (95%CI 0.63-1.81) and 1.02 (95%CI 0.70-1.50) for AMP and methacholine, respectively. There were also no differences between genotypes for all secondary outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPolymorphisms of leukotriene C4 synthase did not determine responsiveness, in terms of attenuation of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, to leukotriene receptor antagonists in mild-to-moderate asthmatics.

Although H1 and H2 receptor antagonists are used in the treatment of anaphylaxis, there have been reports implicating these drugs in the genesis of dysrhythmias. This study was designed to investigate the effects of the selective H1 and H2 receptor antagonists loratadine and ranitidine on physiologic autonomic control of the healthy cardiovascular system. Methods Using a double-blind, crossover design, 14 healthy volunteers completed the protocol and were randomized to receive one dose of loratadine (20 mg), ranitidine (300 mg), or placebo on each of three separate testing sessions. Continuous electrocardiogram and BP recordings were obtained before and 3 h after administration of study drug. Effects on cardiac autonomic control were quantified using power spectral analysis of heart rate variability and calculation of spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity. Results Neither placebo nor loratadine significantly altered indices of autonomic cardiovascular control. Conversely, H2 antagonism with ranitidine resulted in a 23.3% decrease in baroreflex sensitivity (P < 0.05) and a corresponding 25.0% decrease in the ratio of high frequency to total power of heart rate variability, both indices of parasympathetic modulation (P < 0.01). Furthermore, ranitidine evoked a concomitant 103.8% increase in the ratio of low to high frequency power of heart rate variability, an index of sympathetic control (P < 0.01). Conclusions H1 receptor antagonism with loratadine does not influence physiologic cardiovascular control in young healthy subjects. However, the altered cardiac sympathovagal balance after oral administration of the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine indicates a shift toward sympathetic predominance in heart rate control. The authors postulate that this could have implications regarding susceptibility to arrhythmias in conditions of heightened sympathetic stimulation.", "outbound_citations": ["2257871", "11054200", "10688593", "10451138", "10327393", "9681472", "9670104", "9570047", "9187166", "7737717", "7733371", "7705382", "7781672", "7527852", "7512679", "8098639", "1724533", "1977785", "1976052", "2199130", "1974182", "2507055", "2567740", "2572187", "3408059", "2461127", "3341694", "3344741", "2874464", "2874036", "2856787", "3970172", "6202436", "6188956", "6124684", "7082501", "7032271", "6267675", "46793", "4330524"], "inbound_citations": ["35025085", "35155967", "34622365", "33849852", "33059072", "32906611", "31844124", "26968542", "27191340", "22966422", "21880544", "22341540", "20667004", "20852875", "19540518", "19463887", "16424734"], "label": "0"}

A concentration of 70 ng Der p 1/m3 of air (feces of Dermatopliagoides) was maintained over 8 h in the VCC. To show the clinical impact of this challenge model, the effect of a histamine H1\u2010receptor antagonist that also has some antiallergic properties (loratadine) was also investigated. The study followed a doubleblind, placebo\u2010controlled, crossover design. Medication was given orally over 7 days before the provocation at a dose of 10 mg once daily. All 12 patients, whose dust\u2010mite sensitivity was confirmed by disease history, skin prick test, and RAST, completed the challenge session. The documentation of the chosen parameters was performed every 30 min. Subjective nasal and ocular symptoms were assessed via a visual analog scale of 100 mm. nasal flow was recorded by active anterior rhinomanometry, and mediator release was evaluated with nasal lavages. Clinical aspect: the whole sample population showed a rise of nasal and ocular symptom severity and a nasal flow reduction, which were perceptibly, but not significantly attenuated by active drug treatment. Mediator pattern: in each patient, prostaglandin (PG)D2 and leukotriene (LT)C4 levels peaked within the first 2 h of provocation, PGD2 then moving toward baseline levels, and LTC4 then again rising continuously. Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) exhibited a constant level increase over the whole provocation period, and tryptase levels did not change significantly. Whereas the area under the curve values of tryptase and ECP were higher in drug\u2010treated patients than the placebo group, the early PGD, peak occurring during the first two challenge hours seemed to be mitigated by loratadine. These results reveal that there is no link between the clinical symptoms, the drug efficacy, and the released mediators (LTC4, PGD2, ECP and tryptase).", "outbound_citations": ["9105520", "7677235", "8238798", "8457035", "8267692", "1514665", "1687320", "2563743", "2583857", "3049743", "3209426", "3571770", "2945499", "6204835"], "inbound_citations": ["30513028", "28566688", "28378369", "27255590", "27792747", "27289490", "26922936", "23146091", "21353365", "20816182", "18498678", "18331513", "17767803", "16757395", "16498847", "16046238", "16266385", "15744168", "15100671", "12791217"], "label": "0"}

Symptoms evaluated were sneezing, nose and/or eye itching, lacrimation, rhinorrhoea, photophobia, nasal occlusion, throat irritation, smell loss, nasal mucosa swelling, conjunctivitis, and pharyngeal mucosa reddening. Each symptom was assessed according to severity and given a score on a fourpoint rating scale.

I sintomi sono stati valutati in base alia loro gravit\u00e0 assegnando un punteggio variabile da 1 a 4. In entrambi i gruppi di trattamento il punteggio totale della sintomatologia \u00e8 risultato inferiore a quello basale ad ogni controllo nel corso dei trattamenti. Non sono state rilevate differenze significative tra i due trattamenti che si sono dimostrati entrambi efficaci. I ricercatori hanno concluso che azelastina spray nasale ha la stessa efficacia di loratidina compresse nell'alleviare i sintomi della rinite allergica stagionale e possiede una notevole rapidit\u00e0 di azione ed una notevole maneggevolezza clinica.", "outbound_citations": ["8105785", "3380879"], "inbound_citations": ["36878860", "35373533", "29438602", "28602936", "29260783", "26409662", "18020517", "21726475", "18534080", "18254486", "17542768", "16490466", "8719584", "14533657"], "label": "1"}

During the same season a second study compared in a randomized way (2 parallel groups) the effect of Budesonide (Rhinocort Aqua) and Azelastine (Allergodil nasal spray) in a group of 14 patients. Results showed that both antihistamines, applied topically of dosed orally, reduced sneezing even when significant increases of histamine concentration in nasal secretions were evidenced immediately after NAC. When a combination of Cetirizine and Cimetidine was administered, a significant (p < 0.01) reduction of nasal airway resistance and increase of nasal airflow after NAC were demonstrated as well. In addition, topical application of Budesonide showed a strong (p < 0.01) effect on the infiltration and activation of eosinophils during the season, and on tryptase release after NAC.

We designed a comparative open randomized study, including 38 patients, with hay fever sensitized to local pollens (grass, olive, parietaria judaica, chenopodium album, artemisia vulgaris and plantago lanceolata) diagnosed by clinical history and a positive skin prick test (wheal > 3 mm), 20 women and 18 men, aged 17 to 57 years (x: 31.32 +/- 9.73), living in the same geographic area. Randomly, after a week run in period, 21 subjects received a daily dose of cetirizine 10 mg during 2 weeks, and the other 17 received 10 mg twice a day. The symptomatic score used was based on: sneezes number, nasal itching, nasal secretion, nasal congestion, ocular itching, lacrimation, weight gain, sedation and additional methylprednisolone usage. All symptoms were scored on a 0-3 scale (0: absent; 1: mild; 2: moderate; 3: severe). A mean 8 points daily score during the previous week was required for recruitment. Nasal eosinophilia was determined at baseline and at the end of treatment. The study was conducted in may 1992.

This study compared the efficacy of combined use of fluticasone and olopatadine with combined use of fluticasone and fexofenadine in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. This 2-site, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study employed the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model, a standardized method of inducing ocular and nasal signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. At visit 1, subjects underwent CAC to determine the dose of allergen required to elicit a positive reaction. The allergen dose was confirmed at visit 2, and, according to a randomization schedule, subjects were dispensed fluticasone, olopatadine, and placebo pill; fluticasone, fexofenadine, and tear substitute; or placebo nasal spray, placebo pill, and tear substitute. CAC took place at visit 3, after patients had used the assigned medications for 2 weeks. Study medication was instilled 2 hours before CAC, after which allergic signs and symptoms were graded on standardized scales. The primary efficacy variables were ocular itching, ocular redness, and overall nasal symptoms. Eighty subjects completed the study: 30 received fluticasone and olopatadine, 30 fluticasone and fexofenadine, and 20 placebo. Women constituted 63.8% of the study population and men 36.3%; 91.3% were white, 3.8% black, 2.5% Hispanic, 1.3% Asian, and 1.3% other. Concomitant use of fluticasone and olopatadine produced significantly greater improvements in ocular itching at 3 and 7 minutes after CAC compared with fluticasone and fexofenadine (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in redness scores between groups; however, concomitant use of fluticasone and olopatadine produced significantly greater improvements in redness at 2 time points in each of the 3 vessel beds (ciliary, conjunctival, and episcleral) compared with placebo, and fluticasone and fexofenadine produced significantly greater improvement in redness at 1 time point in I vessel bed compared with placebo (both comparisons, P < 0.05). The 2 treatments had similar effects on total nasal symptom efficacy scores.

Yet, if OTC doses are effective for treating mild symptoms, why weren't these low, often safer doses made available at least by prescription when the drugs were first approved? OBJECTIVE To examine issues surrounding the delayed approval of OTC doses by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS Information reviewed included package inserts, data obtained from manufacturers, and articles published in MEDLINE (1966 to December 2001). Medications examined included presently available and potentially approved OTC antiinflammatory, gastrointestinal, and antihistamine drugs. RESULTS Considerable data demonstrate the effectiveness of ibuprofen, naproxen, ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine, diphenhydramine, and clemastine at OTC doses. Published studies also show the effectiveness of celecoxib, omeprazole, and fexofenadine at doses 33\u201350% lower than currently recommended for prescription use. CONCLUSIONS OTC doses are effective for many patients with mild symptoms and for some with serious symptoms. However, OTC-like doses are usually not offered when drugs are approved for prescription use because new drugs are usually studied in patients with serious conditions requiring higher doses; manufacturers and the FDA seem to prefer a middle-dose approach; >75% of subjects in premarketing dose studies are male; and averaging the responses of study subjects may obscure a wide range of interindividual variation in drug response. Simplistic dosage guidelines make therapeutic decisions easier. Because dose-related adverse effects frequently diminish quality-of-life and reduce adherence, the early availability of OTC-like doses, at least by prescription, would allow healthcare professionals greater flexibility in matching medication doses to patients\u2019 widely differing needs.", "outbound_citations": ["2568246", "1509976", "11724080", "11573845", "11295958", "11268233", "10691585", "10560596", "10369853", "10577092", "9600480", "9606310", "9555760", "9063344", "9003143", "8678706", "8655877", "8845090", "8163710", "8130383", "8445816", "1782307", "1993488", "2577482", "2892255", "3536289", "2866132", "6465164", "6119774", "6119771", "6111528", "6102442", "6108607", "5524278", "5524284", "5316378", "4899574"], "inbound_citations": ["34396634", "23201698", "20107304", "18945689", "16981848"], "label": "0"}

This necessitates consideration of the long-term effects of antidepressants on multiple clinical endpoints. The antidepressants paroxetine and fluvoxamine are potent in vitro inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 isozymes, respectively. CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are important for the clearance of 30 or more frequently used medications. Moreover, CYP1A2 also contributes to metabolism of 17beta-estradiol and metabolic activation of environmental procarcinogens (e.g., arylamines in cigarette smoke). The aim of this study was to assess the determinants of interindividual variability and extent of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 inhibition during paroxetine and fluvoxamine treatment. Healthy volunteers and patients received caffeine (100 mg) and dextromethorphan (30 mg) at baseline and at steady state of paroxetine (10-20 mg/day, 5-74 days, N = 13) or fluvoxamine (50-100 mg/day, 5-43 days, N = 8). The caffeine metabolic ratio (CMR) and the log O-demethylation ratio (ODMR) of dextromethorphan in overnight urine were used as in vivo indices of the CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 isozyme activities, respectively. All subjects had an extensive metabolizer phenotype for CYP2D6. After fluvoxamine treatment, baseline CMR 5.1 +/- 1.4 (mean +/- SD) decreased to 2.7 +/- 1.1 (p < 0.01). Paroxetine did not have a significant effect on CMR (p > 0.05). In seven of eight subjects in the fluvoxamine group, posttreatment CMR was comparable with the minimum CMR value (2.0) attainable in nonsmoking healthy volunteers. After paroxetine treatment, log ODMR changed from a baseline value of -2.28 +/- 0.37 to -1.13 +/- 0.44, indicating significant inhibition of CYP2D6 (p < 0.001). Subjects' CYP2D6 phenotype did not change after paroxetine treatment. Fluvoxamine had no significant effect on log ODMR (p > 0.05). The extent of inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 by paroxetine and fluvoxamine, respectively, displayed a positive correlation with baseline enzyme activity (p < 0.05). In addition, a negative association was found between the plasma paroxetine concentration and the CYP2D6 activity after paroxetine treatment (r = -0.47, p < 0.05). These data indicate that paroxetine and fluvoxamine treatment with minimum clinically effective doses significantly inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, respectively. The extent of inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine and of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine is dependent in part on the baseline enzyme activity. The interindividual variability in CYP2D6 inhibition by paroxetine can also be explained by variability in plasma paroxetine concentration. Most patients treated with fluvoxamine (50-100 mg/day) will reach population minimums for CYP1A2 activity. These results have potential implications for interindividual variability in the risk for drug-drug interactions mediated by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 as well as for the disposition of 17beta-estradiol and environmental procarcinogens.", "outbound_citations": ["9384467", "9333110", "9333103", "9241008", "8986010", "8873687", "8835701", "8807660", "8653991", "8791769", "8880055", "8845855", "8563766", "8685072", "7782485", "7742153", "7954177", "7955810", "7962687", "8042918", "8035341", "7920691", "8261468", "8333005", "8491061", "8477556", "8485024", "8472319", "8466541", "8174491", "8417277", "1417434", "1394994", "1389951", "1385505", "1412604", "1593914", "1531950", "1531951", "1793525", "1912325", "2060254", "1988240", "2161748", "2305428", "2188269", "2655891", "2721111", "3608349", "2983630"], "inbound_citations": ["26444948", "26152128", "21332946", "18043911", "15121641", "12895196"], "label": "0"}

In light of recent reports that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants may be weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, this study was designed to investigate the effects of paroxetine on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of terfenadine. Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in a randomized open-label, two-period, steady-state crossover study. Terfenadine (60 mg twice daily for 8 days) was administered alone and with paroxetine at steady state (20 mg once daily for 15 days, with terfenadine on days 8 through 15). Extensive electrocardiogram monitoring was conducted throughout, and terfenadine and carboxyterfenadine pharmacokinetics were assessed at the end of each treatment period. One subject withdrew because of adverse experiences related to paroxetine, but the other 11 subjects completed the study uneventfully. On the final day of coadministration, the rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) was unaltered compared with terfenadine dosed alone; maximum QTc values (mean [SEM]) were 404 (4) and 405 (5) msec, respectively. Terfenadine pharmacokinetics were also unchanged; geometric mean steady-state area under the curve (AUC)tau values were 30.0 ng.hr/mL during coadministration compared with 30.8 ng.hr/mL when dosed alone (p > 0.05). The corresponding Cmax values were 3.68 and 3.64 ng/mL (p > 0.05).

In conclusion, paroxetine does not affect the pharmacokinetics or cardiovascular effects of terfenadine.

It has a direct effect on the local vasculature to promote vasodilatation and increase microvascular permeability and may also initiate the more widely spread neurogenic flare. Quantification of these responses and studies of the mediator mechanisms underlying them have been limited by the lack of appropriate techniques to investigate them. To address this we have used two relatively new techniques, scanning laser Doppler imaging (LDI) and dermal microdialysis to measure changes in skin blood flow and the release of histamine within the weal and flare, following intradermal injection of histamine or bradykinin. These measurements have been made both in the absence and presence of the H1 receptor blockers cetirizine and loratadine. Scanning LDI of the inflammatory response revealed marked differences in both the development and steady state responses to the intradermal injection of histamine (1\u20133\u2003\u03bcmol/L) and bradykinin (1\u2003\u03bcmol/L). The development of the flare and the weal response to both histamine and bradykinin was significantly reduced by cetirizine but not by loratadine. The histamine\u2010induced flare area fell by 57\u2003\u00b1\u20034% (mean\u2003\u00b1\u2003SEM, n\u2003=\u200310, P\u2003<\u20030.001) after cetirizine and the area of the weal fell by 73\u2003\u00b1\u200311% (P\u2003<\u20030.009). Bradykinin\u2010induced inflammatory responses were similarly reduced by cetirizine, the weal by 60\u2003\u00b1\u200316% (P\u2003<\u20030.02) and the flare by 61\u2003\u00b1\u20034% (P\u2003<\u20030.005). Measurement of histamine concentration in skin using microdialysis, in six subjects, confirmed that histamine levels rose in the dialysate collected from the weal to 310\u2003\u00b1\u200316\u2003nmol/L following injection of histamine. Histamine levels also rose following bradykinin injection in some subjects (mean 147\u2003\u00b1\u200346\u2003nmol/L, range 18\u2013336). Little increase in histamine concentration was seen in the dialysate from the flare following injection of either histamine or bradykinin. The histamine concentration in dialysate from unprovoked skin was 4.19\u2003\u00b1\u20030.75\u2003nmol/L. These data reveal differences in the dermal responses to different mediators when assessed using scanning LDI. They confirm that histamine is released within the weal but not the flare response to the intradermal injection of both histamine and bradykinin and that its effects on the local vasculature to cause the oedematous weal and the axon reflex\u2010mediated flare are significantly attenuated by the H1 antagonist cetirizine and to a lesser extent by the H1 antagonist loratadine.", "outbound_citations": ["9130502", "9088655", "8689766", "8581836", "8401263", "1453314", "1371395", "1831383", "1703413", "2143522", "2493712", "2481386", "2433332", "2436502", "6236158", "894068", "851254", "4141858", "4645215"], "inbound_citations": ["33794540", "31007896", "29717513", "28168733", "28181317", "25909280", "25209952", "24890140", "24316865", "24051525", "23534896", "23320562", "22286689", "21986353", "21178984", "20651277", "19563700", "19318525", "19371311", "18980631", "18487669", "17441931", "17589307", "16794585", "16498265", "15842548", "15373801", "15373773", "15447025", "15280079", "15020210", "15005740", "14520518", "12835895"], "label": "1"}

In addition to their primary mechanism of antagonising histamine at the H1 receptor, these agents may act on other mediators of the allergic reaction. However, the clinical significance of activity beyond that mediated by histamine H1 receptor antagonism has yet to be demonstrated. Most of the agents reviewed are metabolised by the liver to active metabolites that play a significant role in their effect. Conditions that result in accumulation of astemizole, ebastine and terfenadine may prolong the QT interval and result in torsade de pointes. The remaining agents reviewed do not appear to have this risk. For allergic rhinitis, all agents are effective and the choice should be based on other factors. For urticaria, cetirizine and mizolastine demonstrate superior suppression of wheal and flare at the dosages recommended by the manufacturer. For atopic dermatitis, as adjunctive therapy to reduce pruritus, cetirizine, ketotifen and loratadine demonstrate efficacy.

In contrast, sedation is reduced or absent after administration of recommended doses of second-generation histamine1-receptor antagonists. We measured the initial and steady-state effects of diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine, and loratadine, a second-generation antihistamine, by means of a comprehensive battery of psychometric tests that mirror real-world tasks.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHealthy volunteers (N = 98) were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive loratadine (n = 33), diphenhydramine (n = 32), or placebo (n = 33). A computerized test battery was administered at baseline, on day 1 after administration of the initial dose, and on days 3 and 5.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter the initial dose, subjects taking diphenhydramine demonstrated poorer cognitive performance than subjects taking loratadine or placebo on tasks of divided attention, working memory, speed, and vigilance.

This study compared the efficacy of topical emedastine 0.05% ophthalmic solution with that of oral loratadine 10 mg and their combination in the conjunctival allergen challenge model of allergic conjunctivitis. This was a single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. At visit 1, eligible subjects underwent conjunctival allergen challenge to identify the dose required to elicit a positive allergic reaction. After 7 days, subjects returned for visit 2, at which the allergen dose was confirmed. At visit 3, which took place 2 weeks later, subjects were randomized to receive either emedastine plus placebo capsules, loratadine plus placebo eyedrops, or both emedastine and loratadine. One hour after receiving study drug, subjects were challenged with allergen in both eyes. Allergic signs and symptoms were graded using standardized 5-point scales. The primary efficacy variables were itching and conjunctival hyperemia. Secondary efficacy variables were ciliary and episcleral hyperemia, chemosis, lid swelling, and tearing. Itching was graded subjectively at 3, 5, and 10 minutes after challenge. All other variables were assessed at 5, 10, and 20 minutes after challenge. Eighty subjects (mean age, 43.68 years) were randomized to receive study treatment. Forty subjects (20 men, 20 women) received emedastine plus placebo capsules, 20 (7 men, 13 women) received loratadine plus placebo eyedrops, and 20 (12 men, 8 women) received both active treatments. In the between-group efficacy comparison at visit 3, the difference in itching and hyperemia scores between emedastine and loratadine was statistically significant at all time points (all, P < 0.05). Efficacy scores for the combination of emedastine and loratadine were significantly better than those for loratadine alone at 2 of 3 time points for itching and all time points for hyperemia (P < 0.05). The combination was significantly better than emedastine alone at I of 3 time points for itching and 6 of 9 time points for hyperemia (P < 0.05).

A selegiline transdermal system (STS) has been developed with unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that allow inhibition of central nervous system MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes while substantially avoiding inhibition of intestinal and liver MAO-A enzyme. This novel transdermal system provides targeted MAO inhibition without clinically significant increases in sensitivity to dietary tyramine. We investigated the safety and efficacy of STS in patients with major depressive disorder.\n\n\nMETHOD\n365 outpatients 18 to 65 years old with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder were enrolled at 16 sites. A 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) score of > or = 20 was required for entry. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either STS, 20 mg/20 cm(2), daily or placebo patch for up to 8 weeks. A tyramine-restricted diet was neither required nor advised. Efficacy, safety, and vital sign measures were obtained regularly.\n\n\nRESULTS\n289 patients were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least 1 on-therapy evaluation (STS, N = 145; placebo, N = 144). Although the effect size was modest, at endpoint, STS was statistically superior to placebo on the MADRS (p =.001) and HAM-D-28 (p =.039) ratings and showed a nonsignificant superiority on the HAM-D-17 (p =.069) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity ratings (p <.055). Side effect profiles were similar for STS and placebo with the exception of application-site reaction, which was observed in 31.5% of STS patients and 15.1% of placebo-treated patients (p =.001). No significant differences were observed in blood pressure measures between treatment groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nResults from this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrate that STS may have a modest, but statistically significant, antidepressant benefit compared with placebo and a similar safety profile compared with placebo in the absence of a tyramine-restricted diet.", "outbound_citations": ["111274", "3929314", "6425910", "12625864", "12411221", "10910012", "10767867", "9089426", "8827195", "7519005", "2053632", "2040717", "2491941", "2505303", "3276282", "3283290", "3446308", "3549705", "444788", "338082", "769725", "4579506", "6034391", "5319766", "14056007", "14497198", "14399272", "13549569", "13542682"], "inbound_citations": ["37087864", "36528007", "33520156", "33212405", "33008144", "31562557", "29382960", "29387272", "28562526", "28537214", "27268737", "27715253", "26818632", "26427518", "26211981", "25559087", "25220437", "25249059", "25336957", "24607445", "24955812", "24753693", "24021959", "24231308", "23890583", "24511450", "24168807", "23934742", "23945448", "30890888", "16641841", "22951238", "22951241", "22951239", "22943121", "22169941", "22790112", "17284087", "22951240", "22647063", "22395135", "22833978", "21272511", "21971008", "16490412", "21147941", "19958040", "19909663", "19687003", "19527191", "19321970", "18955941", "18404015", "19750165", "18311418", "18303066", "17568687", "18096106", "17715422", "17614182", "17554106", "17640157", "17502779", "17502787", "17474801", "17244765", "17192761", "17365170", "18007565", "17110814", "17109609", "17064435", "16678954", "16855078", "16860269", "16641841", "16669733", "16352699", "16023777", "17071541", "16251165", "15990999", "15519537", "15825677", "15552546", "15093948", "15328902", "15330686"], "label": "0"}

Neurons producing histamine, histaminergic neurons, are exclusively located in the posterior hypothalamus and transmit histamine to almost all regions of the brain. Histamine H1 antagonists, or antihistamines, often prescribed for treatment of allergic disorders, sometimes induce sleepiness and cognitive deficits. It is understood that the mechanism of such CNS side effects is that antihistamine blocks H1Rs in the brain. The purpose of the present study was to compare the CNS side effects of different antihistamines. Subjective sleepiness was measured using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and psychomotor performance was examined by a tachistoscope testing system in healthy, young, Japanese volunteers (16 males, 20-28 yrs.) before and after oral administration of antihistamines such as fexofenadine (FEX) and cetirizine (CET). Additionally, H1R occupancy by antihistamines was examined by PET with 11C-doxepin in 8 volunteers. The results of SSS and psychomotor tests demonstrated that FEX tended to be less sedative than CET though the difference was not statistically significant. PET measurements revealed that no H1Rs in the cerebral cortex were occupied by FEX while about 30% of H1Rs were occupied by CET. In summary, it was confirmed that histamine and H1Rs are involved in maintaining arousal and cognition in humans, and that the severity of clinical symptoms is correlated to the amount of antihistamine that penetrated into the brain.", "outbound_citations": ["11874393", "11682143", "11736858", "11493714", "11265983", "10694210", "10444209", "8917588", "8564232", "8093514", "1584454", "6713171", "4719486"], "inbound_citations": ["36843057", "35536762", "34829325", "34474941", "33453630", "31589842", "31558036", "31585379", "31024298", "30709532", "29979840", "29532516", "29461689", "29135515", "28544909", "28630938", "30035466", "27863621", "27315202", "27488192", "26559748", "27063957", "27083108", "26999510", "26827606", "25921948", "25459584", "25680109", "25543037", "24142460", "24745683", "24115141", "24053436", "24634595", "24161893", "24267356", "24039230", "23883803", "24285318", "22867694", "23233797", "22455874", "22313287", "22524274", "22331755", "22207526", "22227742", "22130869", "21316270", "21693127", "21782893", "21737041", "21969990", "20586657", "22299308", "20060425", "21109749", "20685608", "20674357", "20735428", "20083393", "20425503", "19745643", "19496739", "20230762", "19075718", "18781905", "18192642", "18555194", "18439959", "18253678", "18181241", "18364622", "18493749", "18041488", "17092978", "17666161", "17558437", "17883909", "17367592", "17406859", "17329841", "17349864", "17165263", "17053486", "16806167", "16722842", "16767419", "16278258", "16086364", "16211188", "15893247", "15771708", "15608077", "15746880", "15643338", "15665857", "16076650", "15548781", "15536445", "15144965", "15138430", "15176523", "14978232", "15008585", "14754980", "15301993", "14977391", "14700013", "14696020", "14530791", "12771361"], "label": "0"}

Configurational stability was also investigated. Levocetirizine was rapidly and extensively absorbed: 85.4% and 12.9% of the radioactive dose were recovered 168 h post-dose in urine and faeces, respectively. Levocetirizine and/or its metabolites were not, or only very poorly, associated with blood cells, as the blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.51 to 0.68. The mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 26.9 1 (0.3 l/kg) indicating that the distribution of levocetirizine is restrictive. The protein binding of radiolabelled levocetirizine was 96.1% l h after administration. In vitro, at concentrations ranging from 0.2 microg/ml to 1 microg/ml, the protein binding was 94.8% to 95.0%. Levocetirizine is very poorly metabolised. The cumulative 48-h excretion as parent compound accounted for 85.8% of the oral dose, equivalent to 95% of the total radioactivity excreted at this time. At least 13 minor metabolites were detected in urine and represented 2.4% of the dose at 48 h. The metabolic pathways involved in levocetirizine metabolism are oxidation (hydroxylation, O-dealkylation, N-oxidation and N-dealkylation), glucuroconjugation, taurine conjugation and glutathione conjugation with formation of the mercapturic acids. There was no evidence of chiral inversion of levocetirizine in humans.

Skin test with histamine was performed in the hospital before the trial, after 2 weeks, and in the last day of the treatment. The obtained results showed a marked decrease in erythema, wheals, and prurigo in patients treated with loratadine. No such an improvement was seen in placebo group.

The disease is multifactorial, and although genetic predisposition is certainly a prerequisite, a number of environmental factors modulate the phenotypic expression of AD. The majority of affected children shows IgE sensitisation towards a large variety of foods and aeroallergens. Since at least 1600, it has been recognized that patients with AD have a high predisposition to develop asthma. Recent epidemiological studies show that AD is commonly seen in individuals from families with a history of asthma. In addition, in population where asthma is uncommon, AD is also uncommon. The sex distribution of AD and asthma is the same, with boys affected significantly more often by these two atopic diseases and in similar proportions. The ETAC project (Early Treatment of the Atopic Child) is a large multicenter, multi-national, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial. The main objective of the study is to stop the progression from AD to asthma in young children with AD using early therapeutic intervention with Cetirizine and the second objective is to investigate the main risk factors for the onset of asthma. The results of this study indicate that exposure to potent allergens such as cat or mite significantly increased the risk of sensitisation to these allergens. Prolonged breast feeding was associated with a lowest sensitisation rate to cow milk proteins and to egg. Therefore environmental factors seem to play a crucial role in IgE sensitisation in children with AD.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

The antihistamines reviewed here are acrivastine, astemizole, cetirizine, ebastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine, and terfenadine. However, these drugs are not entirely free from central effects, and there are at least quantitative differences between them. Although psychomotor and sleep studies in healthy subjects in the laboratory may predict that an antihistamine does not cause drowsiness, the safety margin can be narrow enough to cause a central sedating effect during actual treatment. This might result from a patient's individual sensitivity, disease-induced sedation, or drug dosages that are for various reasons relatively or absolutely larger (patient's weight, poor response, reduced drug clearance, interactions). Mild to even moderate sedation is not necessarily a major nuisance, particularly if stimulants need be added to the regimen (e.g. in perennial rhinitis). Furthermore, patients can adjust doses themselves if needed. Sedating antihistamines are not needed for long-term itching, because glucocorticoids are indicated and more effective. It is wise to restrict or avoid using antihistamines (astemizole, terfenadine) that can cause cardiac dysrhythmias, because even severe cardiotoxicity can occur in certain pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Histamine H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) are used in the treatment of allergic disorders. The therapeutic effects of most of the older antihistamines were associated with sedating effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and antimuscarinic effects causing dry mouth and blurred vision. Non-specific \"quinidine-like\" or local anaesthetic actions often led to cardiotoxicity in animals and man. Although such adverse effects varied from drug to drug, there was some degree of sedation with all old antihistamines. Non-sedating antihistamines have become available during the past 15 years. Some of them also have antiserotonin or other actions that oppose allergic inflammation, and they are not entirely free from sedative effects either. In small to moderate \"clinical\" concentrations they are competitive H1 receptor antagonists, although large concentrations of some of them exert non-competitive blockade. Daytime drowsiness and weakness are seldom really important, and they restrict patients' activities less than the old antihistamines. Some new antihistamines share with old antihistamines quinidine-like effects on the cardiac conducting tissues, and clinically significant interactions have raised the question of drug safety. This prodysrhythmic effect has also been briefly mentioned in comparisons of non-sedative H1 antihistamines.", "outbound_citations": ["9433369", "9396979", "9343494", "9291422", "9228228", "9142080", "9066452", "9042073", "9020417", "8977506", "8792922", "8808167", "8720304", "8621847", "8725389", "8750398", "8703650", "8564232", "7614779", "7677241", "7895614", "7916150", "7911286", "7908779", "8008209", "8056991", "7903515", "28634740", "8256752", "8449068", "8095149", "8412498", "1382132", "1354949", "1686208", "1680760", "1715267", "1672494", "2148177", "1981354", "22282895", "2905151", "2885356", "2878812", "3840066", "6138120", "6120713", "6116139", "368248"], "inbound_citations": ["26484391", "25781274", "22706597", "11270939", "22095508", "21975494", "24826012", "20110603", "19697300", "21437146", "19114463", "18445990", "17620221", "16890992", "17180728", "16459275", "16278258", "15347340", "15286093", "15317447", "15284187", "15100174", "12974516"], "label": "1"}

The sensation of pruritus, disturbance of sleep due to pruritus, and feeling of sleepiness in the morning were recorded. Mometasone furoate 0.1 per cent cream was applied to all patients once daily. One group received loratadine syrup and another group received placebo syrup. They were followed-up on day 5, 8 and 15.

Recent research has indicated that not all second-generation antihistamines are comparable with respect to somnolence and other cognitive processes. Patients aged > or = 12 years and actively exhibiting symptoms of allergic rhinitis were randomized to 2 treatment groups to receive 10 mg loratadine or 10 mg cetirizine daily at 8:00 AM for 1 week. After patients took the medication, their somnolence and degree of motivation to perform activities were recorded in an electronic diary using a visual analog scale 4 times during the workday (8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, noon, and 3:00 PM). Sixty patients (31 men, 29 women) were randomized to treatment. Somnolence scores were similar for both groups at baseline and at the time of dosing (8:00 AM). However, there was a statistically significant difference in somnolence scores between the loratadine and cetirizine groups at 10:00 AM (P = 0.008), noon (P = 0.001), and 3:00 PM (P < 0.001), with the cetirizine group showing a greater degree of somnolence.

The aim of the study was to determine the effect on bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) assessed at baseline and after 3 years of LNIT or pharmacological treatment alone. Forty-three randomized patients with allergic oculorhinitis were enrolled (26 positive to Graminaceae and 17 to Parietaria judaica pollens). All patients were asked whether they were willing to follow a 3-year treatment course involving preseasonal LNIT with a powder extract of Graminaceae or Parietaria pollens. Twenty-four patients (16 allergic to Graminaceae and eight to Parietaria) selected LNIT and the other 19 opted for symptomatic pharmacological treatment only. The latter was considered the control group. On the basis of positive or negative bronchial hyperresponsiveness and the LNIT, four subgroups were established and followed in open conditions, during which a record was kept of symptom scores, drug use, spirometry and methacholine test findings. After 3 years, patients treated with LNIT had a significant reduction of symptoms and drug intake. In the controls, symptoms worsened, thus requiring more drugs to control them. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness significantly improved in hyperreactive patients receiving LN7IT 10 of whom were no longer hyperreactive and one at a higher threshold. Among controls, bronchial hyperresponsiveness did not change, with the exception of three nonreactive patients who became hyperreactive, one of them with asthma. These findings confirm the efficacy of LNIT in allergic rhinitis suggesting that it might have systemic activity interfering with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and hence the onset of bronchial asthma.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31743965", "26954254", "26839083", "27471689", "23710946", "17708457", "20525156", "20525156", "16192741"], "label": "0"}

Although therapy with intranasal corticosteroids and intranasal cromolyn has gained acceptance in recent years (2), antihistamines (H1-receptor antagonists) remain the first-line treatment. The possible differential effects of sedating compared with nonsedating antihistamines on driving performance and the risk for motor vehicle crashes represent an important consideration in choosing between the two categories of agents in patients who drive. In this issue, Weiler and colleagues (3) report on a study in which they used a driving simulator to compare the effects of various agents on measures of driving performance: 60 mg of fexofenadine (a nonsedating antihistamine), 50 mg of diphenhydramine (the prototypic sedating antihistamine), alcohol (sufficient to produce an estimated 0.1% blood alcohol concentration, which is greater than or equal to the legal driving limit in all states with a specified limit), and placebo. This randomized, double-blind, single-dose study used as its primary outcome a measure known as coherence, the degree to which the study participant matched the speed of the vehicle that he or she was following. The investigators found that the mean coherence score after participants took diphenhydramine (0.877) was statistically significantly lower (that is, worse) than the mean score after they took alcohol (0.920), fexofenadine (0.915), or placebo (0.906). In most but not all secondary end points, scores for both diphenhydramine and alcohol were statistically worse than those for placebo but fexofenadine and placebo did not differ significantly. Weiler and colleagues also found that subjective feelings of drowsiness did not correlate well with impairment, suggesting that patients receiving antihistamines may not be able to judge when they are impaired. This paper adds to a large body of studies, many of which are reviewed elsewhere (4-12), showing that sedating antihistamines impair psychomotor performance or measures of driving performance under experimental conditions, such as driving simulators or road tests. These experimental studies have shown impairment after single and, less frequently, multiple doses, as well as a dose-effect relation (7). In contrast, the newer, nonsedating antihistamines have much smaller or even undetectable effects at recommended doses, although impairment sometimes occurs at higher-than-recommended doses (7). One exception is cetirizine, a newer agent whose label includes the precautions typical of sedating antihistamines. Given that sedating antihistamines impair measures of driving performance in experimental settings, one might expect that they would also increase the risk for motor vehicle crashes in real-life settings. Two nonexperimental studies have examined the effect of antihistamine use on the frequency of motor vehicle crashes in real life. In the first of these studies, Ray and colleagues (13), using an administrative database, found a relative risk of 1.2 (95% CI, 0.6 to 2.4) for injurious motor vehicle accident associated with current use of antihistamines but detected no dose effect. Although it was not specifically stated in the paper, terfenadine, the only nonsedating agent available at the time, was excluded (Ray WA. Electronic communication, 30 September 1999). In another study using administrative data, Leveille and associates (14) found a relative risk for injurious motor vehicle accidents of 0.7 (95% CI, 0.3 to 1.7) associated with current use of a sedating antihistamine. What might account for the apparent discrepancy between the multiple positive studies in experimental settings and the two negative studies in nonexperimental settings? One possibility is that there is a real effect of antihistamines on the risk for motor vehicle crashes that is too small to be detected with the resolution of the nonexperimental studies. For example, by examining the 95% CIs, we can see that even though they are not statistically significant, those in Ray and colleagues' study indicate a relative risk as high as 2.4 and those in Leveille and associates' study indicate a relative risk as high as 1.7. Another potential reason for the discrepancy is that tolerance of the effects of antihistamines develops over time (7), which would reduce the apparent effect in nonexperimental settings, whereas most (but not all) experimental studies have been single-dose studies. A third possibility is that the relative risks in the nonexperimental studies are biased downward because being classified as exposed was based on having a prescription dispensed from a pharmacy rather than actually taking the drug. Thus, because participants are classified as exposed for a certain period after having had a prescription filled, regardless of whether they took any drug, the relative risks may be artificially reduced. Similarly, because antihistamines are available without a prescription, undetected antihistamine use among those labeled as unexposed may have artificially reduced the relative risks. On the other hand, other factors may have artificially inflated the relative risk. For example, a common indication for antihistamine use is allergic rhinitis, which may itself cause sedation (15). Because neither nonexperimental study attempted to account for this potential confounding by indication due to allergic rhinitis, the reported relative risks associated with antihistamine use may actually represent the effect of a combination of both the drug and the indication. Furthermore, both studies were performed in elderly persons, who might have a more pronounced response to antihistamines than younger persons. Another explanation for the apparently inconsistent results is the possibility that the effects seen in experimental settings are true but do not translate into an increased risk for motor vehicle crashes in real life. For example, the coherence measure evaluated in Weiler and colleagues' study (3) has not been validated as a true indicator of risk for motor vehicle crashes. Even if the measure is valid, we do not know the magnitude of change in this measure that constitutes an important level of impairment; that is, although some of the observed differences were statistically significant, we do not know their clinical significance. Studies that correlate these experimental measures of driving impairment and the occurrence of real-life motor vehicle crashes and determine the clinically important decrement are still needed. Also important is the conduct of studies in real-life settings that overcome the limitations faced by the nonexperimental studies. In summary, existing data indicate that usual doses of sedating antihistamines impair measures of driving performance in experimental settings, an effect not produced by nonsedating antihistamines. The clinical significance of these impairments is unknown. Studies of the risk for motor vehicle crashes in real-life settings have resulted in inconclusive to negative results. This information must be considered in light of what is known about the effectiveness of these agents: namely, that there is no established effectiveness advantage for either category. Cost should also be considered. One Internet pharmacy site recently (5 October 1999) listed the cost for loratadine and fexofenadine, the two currently available nonsedating antihistamines, at $1.86 and $1.69 per day, respectively. The same pharmacy listed the cost per day for the leading brand of nonprescription diphenhydramine (at doses of 25 or 50 mg four times daily) at $0.50 to $1.00 and the least expensive diphenhydramine product at $0.29 to $0.58 per day. Despite these price differences, given the lack of an established effectiveness advantage of sedating agents and uncertainties about their effect on the risk for motor vehicle crashes, the safest approach would be to preferentially initiate therapy with nonsedating antihistamines over sedating antihistamines in patients who drive. Future research on the effect of sedating antihistamines on the risk for motor vehicle crashes in nonexperimental settings may or may not ultimately alter the basis for such preferences. Unless this occurs, however, nonsedating antihistamines should generally be preferred over sedating antihistamines in patients who drive.", "outbound_citations": ["28672331", "10691585", "9860027", "9530538", "9066452", "9003207", "9020417", "7677241", "7841240", "7913608", "8504389", "8101691", "1442753", "1979799", "2903811"], "inbound_citations": ["30885078", "24766875", "23474655", "17883909", "15056408", "14582817", "14502773"], "label": "0"}

This view must be accepted. yet can hardly be assessed under treatment of allergic disorders. Since central sedative potency is hard to evaluate, different methods of measurement have been introduced in the four phases of clinical investigation. While tests of high complexity in early trials can detect true central effects, they seem to have the disadvantage of not taking into consideration the important interactions of drugs with the disorder. Therefore, we used a visual analog scale (VAS) as an instrument to demonstrate sedative effects in five clinical studies carried out between 1989 and 1994 with a total number of 1070 patients. Thereby, we could assess the result of the different components of the central interaction. In 1989, in a double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial, we could show that the vigilance of patients suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis increased significantly more under treatment with an antihistamine (mizolastine) than under placebo. From 1992 until 1994, we compared azelastine nasal spray either by the double\u2010dummy technique with oral antihistamines (cetirizine, loratadine, and astemizole) or by the double\u2010dummy or placebo\u2010controlled design with monotherapy or combined therapy with azelastine tablets. A marked or statistically significant improvement of vigilance was found for all compounds (loratadine: P < 0.0001; cetirizine: P < 0.0254; and azelastine nasal spray: P < 0.1409 to P < 0.0001). Even when taking azelastine as oral application, patients, in spite of the warning, reported a similar increase in vigilance (P < 0.2628 to P < 0.0001). Finally, we assessed the range of physiologic vigilance using the same VAS in healthy volunteers. In conclusion, we could prove that in all trials the baseline values of vigilance of untreated symptomatic patients were far below physiologic condition and improved under treatment to the upper range of healthy persons. Therefore, any sedative properties of modern H1\u2010antihistamines should not limit their therapeutic use. since the truly threatening sedation results from the disorder itself.", "outbound_citations": ["9161315", "7645682", "7645683", "1393763"], "inbound_citations": ["31612732", "29278026", "24815889", "24428966", "24074153", "24074154", "11270939", "21316270", "20067329", "19592081", "19788014", "19558008", "19476052", "18618902", "19209282", "18439959", "17666161", "17165263", "17053486", "16490466", "16390347", "15878457", "15564776", "15701213", "15536445", "15180765", "15168099", "15005764", "15100670", "15049399", "15160440", "14977391", "14582817", "12917016"], "label": "1"}

The magnitude of the beneficial effects of each H1-antagonist should be related to the magnitude of the unwanted effects, especially in the CNS and cardiovascular system, and a benefit-risk ratio or therapeutic index should be developed for each medication in this class.", "outbound_citations": ["7613197", "7897151", "7909915", "8201490", "8264561", "8353656", "8260280", "8213879", "8349874", "8338292", "8372999", "8368985", "8369689", "8369688", "8104017", "8099138", "8513654", "8101096", "8341890", "8480602", "8463921", "8445816", "8445813", "8096817", "8097102", "8430297", "8434887", "8382980", "8425237", "8421245", "8319160", "8433408", "1360991", "1474173", "1485658", "8346863", "1526078", "1355951", "1355952", "1418695", "1327391", "1501118", "1644069", "1418048", "1578320", "1472530", "1561478", "1942426", "1683192", "1937973", "1686208", "1678801", "1680760", "1677532", "1677551", "1676921", "1679231", "1672494", "1709851", "1977935", "2148177", "2243152", "1979207", "1974696", "2370544", "2196521", "2376181", "2363755", "1971741", "2328468", "1970834", "2351800", "2574731", "2574665", "2574627", "2572753", "2529798", "2572611", "2570798", "2471718", "2521869", "2565725", "2566537", "2564285", "2919514", "2910633", "2562944", "2570799", "2905151", "2903812", "3139866", "2900995", "3414615", "3220614", "2453531", "3342361", "3362727", "3130890", "3122717", "2887328", "2885356", "3578980", "2885365", "3559970", "3559100", "3562147", "3586086", "3567016", "3786225", "3092904", "2875889", "3763663", "3718632", "3761171", "3712143", "3516976", "2874116", "2868774", "3952257", "3100463", "2866710", "3840066", "2869766", "2859543", "2860766", "3837045", "6146180", "6490221", "6733616", "6140978", "6141198", "6348106", "6219138", "6676678", "6133525", "6128019", "6294215", "7104167", "7088637", "7073039", "6121601", "6124876", "6120713", "6129863", "7199833", "7241780", "6115667", "6118170", "7247643", "7277304", "7243454", "7411413", "508506", "449773", "36066", "33398", "37045", "28058", "27203", "27204", "26361", "859051", "855838", "264413", "5853", "770511", "615", "242240", "239337", "22454872", "4648434", "4397942", "5694107", "4384127", "4227701", "4379909", "5919589", "14276045", "14200289", "14076013", "14462919", "13317819", "15421806", "15421813", "18869868", "20281880", "20997205", "6995128", "1358620", "1355427", "22437", "2892448", "2886343", "6236679", "8401109", "3086105", "947035", "2885203", "2971550", "55705", "4443870", "192560", "2864258", "2869", "7106172", "3168512", "2903811", "1513379", "14794436", "3982720", "4501873", "6418551", "4857", "2972548", "1970299", "32044", "33053", "614", "1684750", "24512", "590304", "2905156", "1684274", "4131054", "2226222", "1233248", "88321", "2903059", "8405028"], "inbound_citations": ["36353984", "36133817", "34676184", "34400315", "33031909", "34594226", "32634675", "32133778", "31132246", "29150713", "28035215", "24184432", "24574047", "23936459", "23463133", "23723474", "22218088", "6794704", "11270939", "22249816", "19943707", "22222706", "8828023", "21909407", "20946090", "20961625", "20354138", "20146728", "20112008", "20001110", "19745643", "19216223", "18676086", "18596120", "18546078", "18081747", "17936567", "18772045", "17452107", "17288686", "9565387", "16530398", "16174671", "16767419", "16636115", "16572480", "16536908", "16389668", "17019882", "19804057", "17561634", "7524288", "16113474", "15496643", "15286093", "15233966", "16120371", "7589029", "12855401"], "label": "0"}

A group of 27 patients with a positive patch test to an allergen consecutively received cetirizine 10 mg o.d. or placebo during a 14-day period, respectively. At day 11 of each period, patch testing was performed with the allergen. The image analysis showed a skin reaction significantly reduced under cetirizine (p = 0.03), but the clinical recording and the standardized chromatometry did not show any difference between groups. In the cross-over analysis the results of image analysis were influenced by the period, but this effect disappeared after adjustment of the ambient temperature during the 3 days of the test. These results demonstrate that cetirizine has an impact on the inflammatory process in a clinical model of cell-mediated allergic reaction, although this effect is only detected with a very sensitive technique. They also show that it is useless to stop antihistamines before patch testing, since clinical evaluation of tests is not hampered by a potent antihistamine. Additionally this study suggests that ambient temperature has an influence on the results of tests.", "outbound_citations": ["8746331", "8156449", "4092458", "4266825", "4400703", "5769323"], "inbound_citations": ["32475511", "31765106", "31765083", "27185421", "23156851", "15528221", "15017642"], "label": "1"}

Twelve-lead electrocardiographic data were collected once before and after dosing or serially throughout these studies.

Desloratadine is a systemic antihistamine indicated for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of ketotifen 0.025% ophthalmic solution instilled in the eye, desloratadine 5-mg tablets taken orally, and their combination for prevention of the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, as induced by the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model. This was a randomized, double-masked, placebo- and active-controlled, single-center clinical trial. At visit l, the dose of allergen necessary to elicit a qualifying allergic reaction was determined for subjects meeting the entry criteria. At visit 2, the allergen dose determined at visit 1 was confirmed, and all subjects who had a qualifying ocular and nasal allergic reaction were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: ketotifen ophthalmic solution and placebo tablet, desloratadine tablet and placebo eyedrop, or ketotifen and desloratadine. Subjects were instructed to instill 1 drop into each eye twice daily and take 1 tablet with water once daily at the same time as the morning eyedrop for approximately 4 weeks. At visit 3, subjects brought in their medication and were given 1 drop of the eyedrop bilaterally and 1 tablet with water. Bilateral CAC was performed 2 hours after administration of medication. Using standardized scales, subjects rated ocular itching at 3, 5, and 7 minutes after CAC; ocular tearing and eyelid swelling at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after CAC; and nasal signs and symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea and postnasal drip, pruritus, and nasal congestion) at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes after CAC. The investigator graded ocular redness and chemosis at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after CAC. At all visits, subjects were offered an anti-allergy eyedrop to relieve any immediate ocular discomfort caused by CAC. One hundred two subjects were screened-82 (55 women, 27 men; mean age, 42.8 years [range, 21-70 years]) were randomized to treatment, and 80 completed the study. Subjects in the group that received ketotifen (n = 27) and the group that received ketotifen with desloratadine (n = 26) had significantly lower mean itching scores compared with those in the group that received desloratadine alone (n = 27) at all time points (P </= 0.05). Total ocular redness, calculated by summing the mean redness scores for each of the 3 vessel beds, was significantly lower in the ketotifen group than in the other treatment groups at most time points (P </= 0.05). All treatments attenuated nasal symptoms; no statistically significant differences were noted between treatment groups, with the exception of the 50-minute time point, at which combination treatment was significantly more effective than ketotifen alone (P </= 0.05). The proportion of subjects who requested relief drops after CAC was significantly lower in both the ketotifen alone and combination treatment groups compared with the desloratadine alone group (P = 0.004). Ketotifen ophthalmic solution significantly decreased the signs and symptoms of ocular and nasal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

A number of drugs in this class are approved for use: acrivastine, astemizole, azelastine, cetirizine, ebastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine and terfenadine. All of them have a more favourable risk-benefit ratio with regard to the CNS adverse effects. Even those second generation antihistamines that are not actually 'nonsedating' are less impairing than their predecessors, but not one of them is entirely devoid of CNS activity. Under certain circumstances some antihistamines may affect cardiac repolarisation resulting in cardiovascular adverse effects. Serious cardiovascular effects have been reported with terfenadine and astemizole when they are used in high dosages or when they are given to 'at risk' patients. Animal models indicate that there might be a potential risk of cardiovascular adverse effects with other antihistamines as well. However, up to now there is no clinical evidence for this assumption, despite some confusing reports. Likewise there has been much discussion about a link between these agents and carcinogenicity. However, there is no evidence that any of the second generation antihistamines increase the risk of tumour growth in humans. Small children, elderly patients and persons with chronic renal or liver impairment are special groups in which the individual adverse effects of the second generation antihistamines must be kept in mind. The dosage for an individual has to be modified with respect to their metabolic situation. Despite the fact that some of the second generation antihistamines are listed in the US Food and Drug Administration pregnancy risk classification as class B, the use of second generation antihistamines should be avoided during pregnancy and they should never be administered to nursing mothers. Taking into account their negligible CNS activity, the low incidence of cardiovascular adverse effects, their lack of anticholinergic effects and other benefits, this class of antiallergic drugs represents a definite advance in therapy.", "outbound_citations": ["10459910", "9217740", "9217741", "9142080", "9129556", "9188956", "9048526", "9065344", "9218935", "9020417", "8977506", "8917271", "8929007", "8904993", "8829247", "8645428", "8876072", "8630718", "8836336", "8604626", "8808167", "8720305", "8720304", "8725389", "8779211", "8750398", "7658569", "8556569", "7658480", "7554700", "7645683", "7783995", "7606309", "7613197", "7613198", "7697852", "7712667", "7677241", "7810513", "8001268", "7756096", "7838127", "7551204", "8587704", "7930305", "7982120", "8189766", "7909571", "7913608", "8023479", "8109548", "8056991", "8264561", "28634740", "8260280", "8264923", "7693767", "8220804", "8104017", "8498418", "8480602", "8100494", "8445816", "8445813", "8439706", "1526078", "1355952", "1354949", "1578320", "1560165", "1727943", "1942426", "1685361", "1937973", "1886159", "1678801", "1676921", "1715267", "1672494", "1977935", "1979799", "1981354", "2196521", "2574665", "2574627", "2564285", "2574054", "2905151", "2900995", "2966185", "2908109", "2892447", "2954497", "2945499", "3734289", "2868774", "2417741", "3840066", "6204835", "6863977", "6132687", "6214791", "7074817", "6120713", "4387247", "1355427", "8797551", "8779212", "7867678", "2886343", "8595536", "2905156", "7510611", "1322467", "6418551", "2892446", "7589029", "2971550", "2879736", "1684750", "1970299", "1684273", "7875184", "8165191"], "inbound_citations": ["32951319", "31783781", "31662387", "27986539", "21968027", "11270939", "20586657", "21062081", "20680589", "20477689", "21083169", "17910560", "17610913", "17518511", "16076650", "15553106", "15264995", "14748620", "14646388", "12854627"], "label": "1"}

Loratadine, a selective histamine type 1 (H(1))-receptor antagonist, has demonstrated antiallergic properties. Leukotriene-receptor antagonists given concomitantly with H(1)-receptor antagonists have been shown to have additive effects in the prevention of bronchospasm in antigen-challenge models.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether montelukast plus loratadine provides improved efficacy to montelukast alone in the treatment of chronic asthma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe efficacy of montelukast alone vs montelukast-loratadine was studied in a 10-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 2 x 2 crossover study. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients received montelukast sodium (10 mg) plus loratadine (20 mg), or montelukast sodium (10 mg) plus placebo once daily for 2 weeks. After a 2-week placebo washout period, patients were crossed over to receive 2 weeks of the other active treatment regimen, followed by another 2-week placebo washout period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMontelukast given concomitantly with loratadine caused significant improvement in percentage of change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) compared with montelukast alone (13.86% vs 9.72%; P =.001). The average additional effect of loratadine (least square mean difference in percentage of change from baseline in FEV(1)) was 4.15% (95% confidence interval, 1.65%-6.65%). Key secondary end points (mean daily beta-agonist use, daytime and nighttime symptom scores, morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate, and the Patient Global Evaluation) all showed significant improvement with montelukast-loratadine (P<.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMontelukast-loratadine significantly improved end points of asthma control during a 2-week treatment period.", "outbound_citations": ["10903264", "9625400", "9914773", "9196086", "9072999", "9042071", "8778601", "8598621", "15789506", "7552933", "7663792", "7636054", "7655699", "8058076", "8087328", "7915192", "8449474", "1430701", "1375009", "1416420", "1979473", "2148176", "1976343", "2690708", "2681330", "2532868", "3238930", "3396671", "2879489", "3125852", "3680512", "2885355", "3294977", "2821765", "3526153", "3883862", "6108512", "4402236"], "inbound_citations": ["35648794", "34030569", "33544746", "31376160", "31129976", "30463872", "29031394", "26072703", "23799245", "23353593", "21970671", "21618887", "20085595", "19544166", "17239638", "18172439", "17454331", "17165277", "16510137", "16440534", "16604753", "16696585", "16354213", "15832054", "15623181", "15347373", "27407633", "14996646", "14702454", "14530795", "12958567", "12859545", "12847492", "12801313"], "label": "0"}

Two hundred thirty-six children ages 6-12 years, with chronic allergic skin disorders were treated for 14 days. The predominant skin condition was atrophic dermatitis (88% of the efficacy population). Evaluation of efficacy was based on investigator and patient assessment of symptoms, overall condition of the disease, and therapeutic response to treatment. After 7 and 14 days of treatment, and in the endpoint analysis (last valid study visit for all patients) the decreases from baseline in mean total sign/symptom scores, and all individual symptoms, did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between treatments. Itching improved 54% in the loratadine group and 58% in the terfenadine group in the endpoint analysis. Forty-five percent of patients treated with loratadine and 46% of terfenadine-treated patients treated had complete or marked relief of their symptoms at endpoint. The efficacy of loratadine increased during the study, suggesting that patients did not develop tolerance to the medication over the 14-day course of therapy. Mild to moderate treatment-related adverse experiences were reported in 7/113 patients (6%) treated with loratadine and 11/119 patients (9%) treated with terfenadine.

Cetirizine shifted the histamine dose-response at both temperatures: statistically significantly at 14 degrees C only. Combined H1- and H2-receptor antagonism shifted the response significantly at both temperatures. H1- and H2-receptors mediate histamine-induced skin vasodilation. The sensitivity of these receptors, particularly the H1- receptor, is attenuated at low skin temperature. Whether the reduced effect in cold skin represents specific receptor or postreceptor desensitization, or nonspecific attenuation of cutaneous vasodilation remains to be elucidated.", "outbound_citations": ["10.1016/0091-6749(90)90037-5", "2191995", "2903677", "8387786", "9253681", "8990694", "8394725", "10.1016/0014-2999(94)90701-3", "8082690", "7138777", "3680788", "8151062", "PMC1564650", "9146885", "7532119", "PMC2175572", "8495247", "PMC1510108", "7834207", "2755913", "7976417", "1676209", "1357879", "8696926", "10.1111/1523-1747.ep12874474", "2307854", "2887328", "6317740", "7553250", "5051999", "8458789", "10.1006/mvre.1995.1070", "8583956", "2409400", "6135145", "PMC1854054", "3179614", "3719106", "10.1016/0165-1838(90)90141-5", "2370420", "8214111", "10.1067/mva.1990.20311", "2165189", "PMC2071551", "6112034", "8096132", "9205741", "7907893", "1977781", "6101337", "6192651", "6151554", "8251354", "6725793", "6858784", "508005", "10.1007/s004030050079", "8844121"], "inbound_citations": ["23488545"], "label": "0"}

Clearly, it is impossible for one or two general internists to reliably identify the most significant clinical advances. We therefore asked 13 general internists at the University of Washington to answer the question, What were the five most important papers or most important advances you read about in the past year? From among their responses, we selected those papers that focused on common and clinically relevant problems and circulated the relevant papers to the editors of ACP Journal Club for their feedback on the adequacy of the scientific evidence. We discuss six themes that emerged for 1996: HIV-related disease, cardiovascular disease, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and several topics in preventive medicine. Much of the material overlaps with that in other Updates in this series; when this overlap occurs, we summarize the results of studies and leave the detailed descriptions to the authors of other Updates. HIV Disease In 1996, the rate of death from HIV-related illness decreased dramatically in the United States. Most experts believe that this decrease reflects the success of changes in treatment. These advances will be discussed in more detail in the upcoming Update in Infectious Diseases. Three clinical trials seem to have put to rest the use of zidovudine monotherapy [1-3]. The results of these studies indicate that multidrug therapy is now the standard of care. Four protease inhibitors are now available, and initial studies have shown that these drugs are associated with major improvements in laboratory outcomes [4]. The major problem now facing clinicians is the complexity of the newer drug combinations. Patients are taking several pills a day; some must be taken with food and others must be taken on an empty stomach. Resistance occurs when treatment is interrupted, and physicians must be mindful of drug interactions. Despite these barriers, however, protease inhibitors are probably the most important advance in HIV treatment in the past 5 years. Predicting the rate of HIV disease progression has become more reliable with the introduction of testing for HIV viral load. In a multicenter AIDS cohort analysis, researchers followed patients until death or for as long as 11 years. They found that the initial HIV viral load was a better prognostic marker than CD4+ cell count [5, 6]. As a result of these and other studies, an expert panel designed a set of guidelines for antiretroviral therapy [7]. Although the standard of care evolves rapidly, there is consensus that patients with symptoms, asymptomatic patients with CD4+ cell counts less than 500 cells/mm3, and patients with high viral load titers-at least 30 000 copies/mL-should be treated. Appropriate treatment regimens include zidovudine or stavudine in combination with lamivudine, didanosine, or zalcitabine. Most experts would now add a third drug (either a protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) when treating any patient. So-called triple therapy is particularly important for patients who are sick or who have very poor prognostic markers. The goal of therapy is to reduce HIV viral load titers at least threefold (optimally to undetectable levels). Cardiovascular Disease A much more common problem in clinical practice is cardiovascular disease. Several themes emerged in 1996, and most will be covered in detail in the upcoming Update in Cardiology. A major question for acute myocardial infarction has been which treatment is better: thrombolysis or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)? Most studies of these treatments have been done in academic medical centers. However, in a community-based retrospective comparison of 12 331 patients who had had acute myocardial infarction and were admitted to 19 Seattle hospitals, researchers found that thrombolysis and PTCA produced similar clinical results [8]. Length of stay was shorter in the PTCA group, but PTCA cost more (median cost, $12 600 for thrombolysis and $16 300 for PTCA). Stroke was slightly more common in the thrombolysis group than in the PTCA group (1.5% and 0.9% of patients, respectively). The main difference was that patients who underwent PTCA had more procedures, especially angiography and repeated PTCA. Another controversy has focused on whether PTCA or coronary artery bypass grafting is superior treatment for multivessel coronary artery disease. A 5-year clinical trial of 1829 patients with this disease showed that the two procedures yielded similar outcomes; the one exception was the clearly greater survival rate in diabetic patients who had coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients who underwent PTCA had considerably more procedures during follow-up [9]. Another clinical issue is maintaining patency of diseased coronary arteries. Most survivors of acute myocardial infarction have total cholesterol levels less than 240 mg/dL, and some experts believe that decreasing these average levels might prevent future acute myocardial infarction. In a 5-year clinical trial, 4159 patients with average cholesterol levels were randomly assigned to receive either pravastatin (40 mg/d) or placebo after acute myocardial infarction [10]. In the pravastatin group, cholesterol levels decreased, and 10.2% of pravastatin recipients had a subsequent coronary event compared with 13.2% of placebo recipients (number needed to treat [NNT] to prevent one death in 5 years, 33). This study further supports the efficacy of the statin drugs after acute myocardial infarction [11]. Congestive heart failure is a common and increasing problem as more patients survive acute myocardial infarction. Estimates of the prevalence of congestive heart failure in developed countries range from 1% to 10%, and the 5-year mortality rate exceeds 50% [12]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics are the cornerstones of therapy. In 1996, a third drug showed promise: carvedilol, an - and -adrenergic receptor blocker. In a clinical trial of 1094 patients with congestive heart failure, the addition of carvedilol to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics reduced the mortality rate from 7.8% to 3.2% (NNT to prevent one death in 6 months, 22) [13]. Another traditional mainstay in the treatment of congestive heart failure has been digoxin. Although this drug has been used for 221 years, its efficacy has been poorly defined except in the setting of atrial fibrillation. However, a conclusion seems to have been reached. In a clinical trial of 7788 patients who had congestive heart failure and were in sinus rhythm, researchers found that after 3 years, the mortality rate in the digoxin and placebo groups was equal [14]. However, patients receiving digoxin had fewer hospitalizations for congestive heart failure (26.8% compared with 34.7%; NNT to prevent one hospitalization in 3 years, 13). Diuretics Were Effective in Elderly Diabetic Patients with Hypertension Curb JD, Pressel SL, Cutler JA, Savage PJ, Applegate WB, Black H, et al. Effect of diuretic-based antihypertensive treatment on cardiovascular disease risk in older diabetic patients with isolated systolic hypertension. Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program Cooperative Research Group. JAMA. 1996; 276:1886-92. The use of thiazide diuretics to decrease blood pressure in elderly diabetic patients has been debated; the adverse effects of these drugs include hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and postural hypotension. Curb and colleagues addressed the use of diuretics in a study of systolic hypertension in the elderly. From their large database, the researchers selected the 583 patients with diabetes and isolated systolic hypertension. Mean patient age was 71 years, and 58% of the patients were women. As part of a larger study, patients had been randomly assigned to receive chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or placebo. Atenolol and reserpine were added, if necessary, to control hypertension. Outcome measures were major coronary artery events, strokes, and all-cause mortality. The study results are summarized in Table 1. The relative risk reduction among the treated diabetic patients was about the same as that among hypertensive patients without diabetes who used the drug. Because adverse cardiovascular outcomes were about twice as common among diabetic patients, however, the absolute benefit of treating diabetic patients was greater. Table 1. Clinical Outcomes of Elderly Patients with Diabetes and Hypertension Who Received Diuretics or Placebo* Calcium Channel Blocker Was Associated with Poor Outcomes Borhani NO, Mercuri M, Borhani PA, Buckalew VM, Canossa-Terris M, Carr AA, et al. Final outcome results of the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS). A randomized, controlled trial. JAMA. 1996; 276:785-91. Another active issue in hypertension is the safety of calcium channel blockers. Several observational studies have suggested the possibility of harm associated with use of short-acting dihydropyridine calcium blockers (such as nifedipine, nicardipine, and isradipine) in hypertensive patients. This 3-year clinical trial measured progression of atherosclerosis in 883 hypertensive patients with carotid atherosclerosis. The patients were randomly assigned to receive hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 to 25 mg/d, or isradipine, 2.5 to 5 mg/d. The major outcome was progression of carotid artery stenosis; secondary outcomes were development of other vascular symptoms. Progression of thickness of the carotid artery wall did not differ between groups. Angina developed in 0.7% of patients in the hydrochlorothiazide group and 2.5% of patients in the isradipine group (P = 0.03). Vascular events and procedures occurred in 7.48% of hydrochlorothiazide recipients compared with 12.21% of isradipine recip", "outbound_citations": ["10592886", "9718051", "9087670", "9036306", "8990335", "8950879", "8813038", "8813040", "8801446", "8855996", "8709686", "8640545", "8638160", "8614419", "8602180", "8602179", "8598838", "8774385", "8822965", "8968018", "8356957"], "inbound_citations": ["18056670", "17179063", "16481635", "12484713"], "label": "0"}

The drug has a rapid onset of action. Improvements in lung function and reductions in as-needed beta2-agonist usage are apparent within 1 day of initiating montelukast treatment in adults and adolescents (aged > or = 15 years treated with 10 mg/day) or children (aged 6 to 14 years treated with 5 mg/day) with persistent asthma as shown in clinical trials. In two 12-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind studies in adults and adolescents aged > or = 15 years with persistent asthma [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) = 50 to 85% predicted] there was significantly (p < 0.05) greater improvement in FEV1, symptom scores, peak expiratory flow (PEF), as-needed beta2-agonist use, peripheral eosinophil counts and health-related quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with montelukast 10 mg/day than in recipients of placebo. Improvements were significantly greater in patients treated with inhaled beclomethasone 400 microg/day than in recipients of montelukast 10 mg/day in 1 of these studies. Nonetheless, 42% of montelukast recipients experienced > or = 11% improvement in FEV1, the median improvement in this parameter in beclomethasone-treated patients. In an 8-week multicentre, randomised, double-blind, study in children aged 6 to 14 years with persistent asthma (FEV1 50 to 85% predicted), montelukast 5 mg/day produced significantly greater improvements in FEV1, clinic PEF, as-needed beta2-agonist use, peripheral eosinophil counts, asthma exacerbations and QOL scores than placebo. The combination of montelukast 10 mg/day plus inhaled beclomethasone 200 microg twice daily provided significantly better asthma control than inhaled beclomethasone 200 microg twice daily in adults with poorly controlled asthma (mean FEV1 = 72% predicted) despite 4 weeks treatment with inhaled beclomethasone. Patients receiving the combination experienced significant improvements in FEV1 and morning PEF, significant reductions in daytime symptom scores, as-needed beta2 agonist usage and night-time awakenings with asthma, and had significantly lower peripheral blood eosinophil counts after 16 weeks in this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Among adults (FEV1 > or = 70%) treated with montelukast 10 mg/day for 12 weeks, inhaled corticosteroid dosages were titrated downward by 47% (vs 30% in placebo recipients), 40% of patients were tapered off of inhaled corticosteroids (vs 29%), and significantly fewer patients (16 vs 30%) experienced failed corticosteroid rescues in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study. During clinical studies, the frequency of adverse events in montelukast-treated adults, adolescents and children was similar to that in placebo recipients. In conclusion, montelukast is well tolerated and effective in adults and children aged > or = 6 years with persistent asthma including those with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and/or aspirin sensitivity. Furthermore, montelukast has glucocorticoid sparing properties. Hence, montelukast, as monotherapy in patients with mild persistent asthma, or as an adjunct to inhaled corticosteroids is useful across a broad spectrum of patients with persistent asthma.", "outbound_citations": ["11240968", "10673241", "10903264", "10722760", "10722763", "10673230", "10673243", "10673245", "10673224", "10673244", "10673231", "10673225", "10673217", "10644288", "10606932", "10678616", "10588994", "10587413", "10588996", "10588604", "10588995", "10588993", "10588612", "10550753", "9895400", "10531140", "10491447", "10508811", "10514017", "10482826", "10471986", "10482828", "10492260", "10456964", "10430730", "10398629", "10378985", "10489824", "10489822", "10378986", "10400832", "10391245", "10351911", "10359889", "10351925", "10335014", "10326941", "10326936", "15073927", "10228127", "10353583", "10234597", "10208944", "10199381", "10075616", "10073320", "10205583", "10069868", "10069892", "10064661", "10064656", "10073523", "10024248", "9933205", "9949315", "10027429", "10027422", "10023966", "10051694", "10051701", "10075622", "9608670", "9875862", "9847434", "9847255", "9878995", "9847254", "9860804", "9843112", "9824404", "9824399", "9988461", "9808690", "9817745", "9821412", "9821415", "9768573", "9738728", "9707144", "9723656", "9723658", "9664090", "9664097", "9800746", "9674492", "9690577", "9679847", "9690569", "9702841", "9643848", "9625400", "9657560", "10099058", "9603112", "9563738", "9508223", "9529415", "9871597", "9544892", "9532969", "9544884", "9522793", "9478929", "9466979", "9466639", "9579164", "9515583", "9500747", "9624291", "9462318", "9448552", "9429741", "9516894", "9358138", "9351905", "9390112", "9203425", "9313005", "9311616", "9329408", "9249244", "9377612", "9226054", "9196086", "9227718", "9210472", "9163663", "9113940", "9105060", "9111500", "9105062", "9042844", "9072999", "9105516", "9127275", "9024176", "9039230", "9250256", "9112058", "9039239", "8730973", "8887574", "8828530", "8828528", "8614425", "8598621", "8630575", "8597680", "8939149", "7634860", "7621356", "7878549", "7972990", "8002686", "8014876", "7913549", "8036306", "8143061", "8146407", "8283197", "8175630", "8111568", "8303624", "8389108", "8096945", "8466117", "8384212", "1321056", "1549827", "1928974", "2014927", "1666630", "2169776", "2821857", "4081413", "6463929", "7369227", "417690", "95924", "1124105", "4210567", "4116963", "9555757", "9393345", "8901365", "10588598", "10371594", "9711449", "9664089", "8152449", "10146873"], "inbound_citations": ["34187561", "33649700", "33423293", "28301050", "27153742", "27094326", "27092145", "27046942", "26862243", "24990512", "25125241", "24971371", "25150871", "22926233", "23245258", "22958412", "22232849", "21771892", "21674173", "20974993", "20842527", "20858152", "20691512", "20031382", "20083671", "19589302", "19416143", "19449366", "19318692", "19151602", "18370234", "16894531", "18603937", "16513447", "16280122", "16281738", "15813665", "15627870", "15189395", "15152893", "14718577", "15013935", "14563743", "14559427", "12810189"], "label": "0"}

DESIGN: A 4-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy study. SETTING: Patients were treated in a variety of allergy practice settings. PATIENTS: The study population consisted of 188 patients who were at least 12 years of age, with symptomatic chronic idiopathic urticaria that had occurred episodically for at least 6 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were given either cetirizine 10 mg once daily, hydroxyzine 25 mg tid, or placebo for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients and investigators used a 4-point scale to evaluate symptoms of urticaria and adverse effects of treatment. Ratings were compared among those taking cetirizine, hydroxyzine, or placebo. RESULTS: After 1 day of treatment, patients randomized to receive cetirizine 10 mg/d exhibited a reduction in the number of episodes of urticaria (and a reduction in pruritus) compared with patients who received hydroxyzine 25 mg tid and patients who received placebo (p = 0.002). The number of urticarial episodes in patients treated with hydroxyzine did not reach significance until day 2 (p = 0.001). Compared with patients who received placebo, patients who received cetirizine and those who received hydroxyzine showed reductions during weeks 1, 2, and 3 and at end-point analysis in the number and size of lesions and in the severity of pruritus (p < 0.04). Patient and physician evaluations at the end of week 4 revealed an improvement in urticarial symptoms for the hydroxyzine and cetirizine groups compared with the placebo group (p < 0.001). Four patients in the hydroxyzine group, 1 patient in the cetirizine group, and 1 patient in the placebo group discontinued the study because of sedation. No patient withdrew because of lack of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Cetirizine 10 mg once daily was equivalent to hydroxyzine 25 mg tid in controlling the symptoms of patients with chronic urticaria, as assessed by patient and investigator evaluations.", "outbound_citations": ["1686439", "1677903", "1979796", "1979798", "1981354", "1977781", "2107240", "2903872", "3126220", "2892451", "3097109", "2874958"], "inbound_citations": ["36808444", "35999169", "34339077", "32400125", "31316698", "30241624", "30197075", "28314658", "27349620", "28081650", "26253363", "25861785", "25397904", "25017532", "23664252", "24766875", "24262692", "24765875", "24925389", "24195758", "23935990", "23282382", "21797930", "21967114", "22035356", "21083565", "19772513", "19081615", "19179823", "19170406", "18954028", "18651988", "18598316", "18364622", "17359390", "17042777", "17330621", "16634701", "16436141", "20476995", "16297006", "15953145", "15548781", "15353166", "15120153", "14680442", "14713918", "14977391", "14530788"], "label": "1"}

Patient preferences for relief of individual allergy symptoms (rhinitis; sneezing; itchy, watery, red eyes; itchy nose, palate, or throat) and related conditions (fatigue, physical limitations) were scored using 2 different questionnaires before treatment (0-to-10 category rating scale for assessing the 4 symptoms of allergic rhinitis) and after receiving placebo for 1 week (Feeling Thermometer).

Leukapheresis began on day 5 of cytokine administration and continued daily until the target yield was reached, or until a maximum of five leukaphereses had been performed. Compared with the filgrastim-alone group (n = 54), the SCF plus filgrastim group (n = 48) showed an increase in the proportion of patients reaching the target yield within five leukaphereses (44% vs 17%, P = 0.002); reduction in the number of leukaphereses required to reach the target yield (P = 0.003); reduction in the proportion of patients failing to reach a minimum yield of 1 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg to proceed to transplant (16% vs 26%, P = NS); increase in the median yield of CD34+ cells per leukapheresis (0.73 x 10(6)/kg vs 0.48 x 10(6)/kg, P = 0.04); and an increase in the median total CD34+ cells collected within five leukaphereses (3.6 x 10(6)/kg vs 2.4 x 10(6)/kg, P = 0.05). All patients receiving SCF were premedicated (antihistamines and albuterol), and treatment was generally well tolerated. Five patients experienced severe mast cell-mediated reactions, none of which were life-threatening.

Non\u2010responders were offered open\u2010label cyclosporin for 4 weeks. All were followed for up to 20 weeks or until clinical relapse; all took cetirizine 20\u2003mg daily throughout the study. The primary measure of efficacy was a daily urticaria activity score (UAS) of weal numbers and itch (maximum score 42 per week). A positive response was defined as a reduction to <\u200a25% of baseline weekly UAS and relapse as a return to >\u200a75%. The effect of cyclosporin on serum HRA was assessed by in vitro basophil histamine release assays and ASSTs before and after treatment. \u2003Results\u2002Twenty\u2010nine patients (19 active, 10 controls) completed the randomized trial medication. Eight of 19 on active treatment but none on placebo had responded at 4 weeks (P\u2003<\u20030\u00b705). Three others on active drug met the criterion for response at 2 weeks but not at 4 weeks. Mean reduction in UAS between weeks 0 and 4 was 12\u00b77 (95% confidence interval, CI 6\u00b76\u201318\u00b78) for active and 2\u00b73 (95% CI \u2212\u200a3\u00b73\u20137\u00b79) for placebo (P\u2003=\u20030\u00b7005). Seventeen non\u2010responders (seven randomized to active and 10 to placebo) chose open\u2010label cyclosporin and 11 responded after 4 weeks. Six of the eight randomized active drug responders relapsed within 6 weeks. Of the 19 responders to randomized and open\u2010label cyclosporin, five (26%) had not relapsed by the study end\u2010point. Mean in vitro serum HRA fell from 36% (95% CI 22\u201349%) to 5% (95% CI 1\u20138%) after cyclosporin treatment (n\u2003=\u200311, P\u2003<\u20030\u00b70001). The ASST response to post\u2010treatment serum was also reduced (P\u2003<\u20030\u00b705). \u2003Conclusions\u2002This study shows that cyclosporin is effective for chronic urticaria and provides further evidence for a role of histamine\u2010releasing autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of this chronic \u2018idiopathic\u2019 disease.", "outbound_citations": ["10233264", "9421487", "9111489", "9140522", "8765822", "8618029", "7822805", "8016897", "7683772", "1373749", "1485053", "1993144", "1692065", "2727470"], "inbound_citations": ["37189714", "36730626", "36610760", "36693356", "36410998", "36808444", "36481045", "36264653", "36297357", "36109590", "36140253", "35853771", "35667749", "34930291", "34650565", "34529248", "34431983", "34141049", "34112473", "33857657", "33727832", "33539587", "33496195", "33385176", "33134229", "32990110", "32621284", "32638557", "32224621", "31954076", "31571935", "31246664", "31332983", "30653672", "31193160", "30355455", "30717573", "30641196", "30585308", "30007073", "30584542", "30390910", "30390911", "30241624", "30263036", "30033912", "30033911", "29336054", "29796863", "29750467", "29750471", "29508728", "29533052", "29129806", "28916431", "22165855", "29527019", "29108771", "28884989", "28852410", "28913986", "28452145", "28299827", "27777182", "27744711", "27349620", "26344939", "28081650", "27882879", "27996138", "28229846", "27417022", "27690471", "27286499", "27264565", "27298500", "27334777", "26918673", "27578075", "26302070", "26562153", "26014373", "26568807", "25515967", "26309723", "26195984", "26174347", "26141580", "26097642", "25542882", "25680926", "25918085", "25851216", "25674297", "25711134", "25672302", "25383135", "25017532", "25066289", "24898678", "24785199", "24947147", "23664252", "24766875", "24656924", "24589165", "24527948", "24262692", "24431904", "24331396", "24915621", "24388213", "24433592", "24765875", "24195758", "24085572", "24034140", "24167521", "24565613", "23948731", "23821106", "23205732", "23352536", "23157716", "22674016", "23282382", "23025508", "23055763", "22729026", "22950565", "23115728", "22586795", "21797930", "12004303", "21958584", "21855127", "22035356", "22053065", "21762974", "21636116", "21699121", "21479356", "21431840", "21083565", "21261741", "21496403", "21778816", "22185048", "20626384", "20711555", "20666769", "20534097", "20203466", "20091657", "20620573", "20128233", "19772513", "19650847", "20523807", "19689515", "19528416", "19400905", "19348933", "19120332", "19081615", "19170406", "19268061", "21437139", "19120535", "18606079", "18774392", "18713139", "18480923", "18477227", "18517070", "18081753", "18373242", "18209176", "18021095", "18094952", "17970889", "17579280", "17456211", "17330621", "17460952", "17533484", "17085288", "17137459", "17010756", "17040448", "17043190", "16918509", "16822377", "16774579", "16634880", "16681569", "16634701", "16831293", "16504920", "16436141", "16461989", "16484822", "16310530", "15627098", "16131914", "20476995", "16015020", "16044256", "15967067", "15898974", "15878460", "15898972", "15765750", "17642671", "15480336", "27407677", "15356567", "15356542", "15115497", "15120153", "15120145", "14999392", "14999391", "14996647", "14723739", "14723734", "14713918", "17642672", "15552715", "14616377", "14501436", "16296157", "12890231", "14524269"], "label": "0"}

We describe here a method to measure quantitatively epithelium thickness. Results were compared with those seen with the use of cetirizine (an antihistamine) and another oral intranasal corticosteroid, beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP).\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients were examined by an ENT specialist who first performed an endoscopic evaluation of the nasal cavities, assessing any morphologic abnormalities and the aspect of the mucosa. Biopsies were taken from the inferior turbinate before and after 24 weeks of treatment. Biopsies were immediately fixed in cold acetone (-20 degrees C) and embedded in glycolmethacrylate; sections of 2 microm were cut on an ultramicrotome. Morphometric evaluations were done in a blinded fashion by computerized image analysis to measure an epithelial area over a minimum length of 50 microm. The thickness was ascertained by the ratio of area to length.\n\n\nRESULTS\n1) For all three treatment groups, the nasal epithelium thickness decreased slightly from pretreatment to the end of treatment. 2) No statistically significant differences between the three treatment groups were found in epithelium thickness. 3) Macroscopically, nasal tissues in all treated groups were normal.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results clearly indicate that long-term treatment with TAA has no atrophic effect on nasal mucosa.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29675754", "28296981", "25590306", "24969737", "22448448", "20816182", "18503843", "18331513", "16701759", "15005760", "15047949", "14763925", "14726906"], "label": "0"}

Sulfidoleukotriene release by blood leukocytes was determined by the cellular allergen stimulation test (CAST), which measures leukotriene (LT)C4, LTD4, and LTE4, all in one assay.

It also suppressed both early (P\u22640.05) and late skin reactions to intradermal tests. Although cetirizine did not influence in vitro sulfidoleukotriene production by blood leukocytes with buffer or anti\u2010IgE (P\u22650.05), it substantially reduced the release of these mediators upon challenge with Dp antigen.

Depending on the histamine concentrations, the ED50 for wheals were in the ranges 4.3\u20134.7, 2.1\u20132.2 and 1.7\u20131.9 mg cetirizine, 2, 4 and 6 h after dosing, respectively. For loratadine, the ED50 for wheals were in the ranges 35.6 \u2013 > 40, 9.1\u201324.1 and 9.1\u201313.9 mg, 2, 4 and 6 h after dosing, respectively.

There is thus a need for a thorough assessment of the cardiac safety of newer antihistamine compounds. This study was undertaken to assess the effects of coadministration of desloratadine or fexofenadine with azithromycin on pharmacokinetic parameters, tolerability, and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. Healthy volunteers aged 19 to 46 years participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, third-party-blind, multiple-dose study. Subjects received desloratadine 5 mg once daily, fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily, or placebo for 7 days. An azithromycin loading dose (500 mg) followed by azithromycin 250 mg once daily for 4 days was administered concomitantly starting on day 3. Group 1 received desloratadine and azithromycin, group 2 received desloratadine and placebo, group 3 received placebo and azithromycin, group 4 received fexofenadine and azithromycin, and group 5 received fexofenadine and placebo. The results of the pharmacokinetic analysis revealed little change in mean maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values for desloratadine with concomitant administration of azithromycin: Cmax ratio, 115% (90% CI, 92-144); AUC, ratio 105% (90% CI, 82-134). The corresponding ratios for 3-hydroxydesloratadine were 115% (90% CI, 98-136) and 104% (90% CI, 88-122), respectively. A substantial increase was observed in mean Cmax and AUC values for fexofenadine when administered with azithromycin: Cmax, ratio, 169% (90% CI, 120-237); AUC ratio, 167% (90% CI, 122-229). Compared with the group receiving desloratadine and azithromycin, subjects receiving fexofenadine and azithromycin also displayed greater variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for the antihistamine. Mean Cmax and AUC values of azithromycin were slightly higher when administered with desloratadine (Cmax ratio, 131% [90% CI, 92-187]; AUC ratio, 112% [90% CI, 83-153]) but were lower when given in combination with fexofenadine (Cmax ratio, 87% [90% CI, 61-124]; AUC ratio, 88% [90% CI, 65-1201). The most common adverse event for all regimens was headache, reported in 20 (22%) subjects. All combinations of desloratadine or fexofenadine with and without azithromycin were well tolerated, and no statistically significant changes in PR, QT, or QT, interval, QRS complex, or ventricular rate were observed. Small increases (<15%) in mean pharmacokinetics of desloratadine were observed with coadministration of azithromycin. By contrast, peak fexofenadine concentrations were increased by 69% and the AUC was increased by 67% in the presence of the azalide antibiotic. Based on the reported adverse-events profile and the absence of changes in ECG parameters, the combination of desloratadine and azithromycin was well tolerated. This study suggests that desloratadine has a more favorable drug-interaction potential than does fexofenadine.", "outbound_citations": ["12169044", "12169045", "11277962", "11277944", "10858871", "10784527", "10783825", "10800633", "10586385", "10421612", "10444234", "10444225", "7587944", "8445813", "1526078"], "inbound_citations": ["33759449", "32302411", "30264382", "28414144", "28035215", "26960809", "26446005", "26135009", "25926125", "25595597", "24937160", "23918211", "23574541", "22684985", "21646440", "22830293", "24309312", "21109747", "20492299", "19601724", "19545214", "18840369", "18180276", "18396776", "18336052", "18454341", "17620222", "17767395", "17050796", "16918512", "20477610", "16669847", "20477072", "16503743", "16259582", "15802355", "15801245", "16329713", "16119972", "15496643", "15345913", "15345904", "15359574", "15236647", "14976396", "15280867", "12609587", "14586383"], "label": "0"}

Nasal challenge was performed by nebulization of increasing doubling doses of histamine (0, 0.04\u20101.28 mg/nostril) in 12 patients (eight men, four women, aged 22\u201039 years). Nasal airway resistance (NAR) was measured by posterior rhinomanometry either 1.5 h or 4 h after intake of cetirizine (10 mg), loratadine (10 mg), or placebo. Baseline NAR was identical between all study days (2.60\u20102.88 cmH2O\u00b71\u22121\u00b7s). One and a half hours after intake, the increase in NAR induced by histamine was significantly reduced by both cetirizine and loratadine in contrast to placebo. However, with cetirizine the nasal obstruction was significantly lower than with loratadine (P<0.05). Four hours after intake, a similar inhibition of the nasal obstruction caused by histamine was observed with both cetirizine and loratadine (P<0.05). In conclusion, this study found cetirizine and loratadine to have similar nasal efficacy at therapeutic dosage 4 h after intake, whereas cetirizine was more effective than loratadine 1.5 h after intake.

Treatment was for a period of eight weeks. The rhinitis symptoms were evaluated according to a four-point scale (0 = absent, 3 = severe). The Total Rhinitis Symptom Score (TRSS) was derived from the sum of the individual symptom scores. Symptoms were assessed at baseline prior to treatment and at weeks 2, 4 and 8. Compared to baseline, TRSS for both the azelastine and cetirizine groups were less at each assessment during treatment, a slight nonsignificant advantage was seen in the azelastine group. At the end of the study, physicians rated global efficacy as being \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018excellent\u2019 in 73.7% of azelastine patients and 55.5% of cetirizine patients. Both treatments were well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported, however, two cetirizine patients withdrew from the study because of somnolence. In conclusion, azelastine has been shown to be at least as effective as cetirizine in the relief of the symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis. Un campione clinico di 20 + 20 pazienti con rinite allergica \u00e8 stato trattato con Azelastina spray nasale alla dose di 2 puff da 0.14 mg/narice/die (0.56 mg/die) o con 1 compressa/die di Cetirizina da 10 mg. La durata del trattamento \u00e8 stata di 8 settimane. I sintomi di rinite sono stati valutati in base ad una scala a 4 punti (in cui 0 = assente o scomparso, 3 = sintomo grave). Il Punteggio Totale dei Sintomi di Rinite (PTSR) \u00e8 stato ottenuto addizionando i punteggi dei singoli sintomi. I sintomi sono stati rilevati prima dei trattamenti (valore basale) e successivamente ad intervalli di 2, 4 e 8 settimane. Ad ogni rilevamento nel corso del trattamento si \u00e8 riscontrata una diminuzione del PTSR rispetto al valore basale, in entrambi i gruppi di trattamento. Nel gruppo Azelastina si \u00e8 manifestata una maggiore diminuzione del punteggio, non statisticamente significativa. Alla conclusione dello studio i ricercatori hanno definita \u201ceccellente\u201d o \u201cbuona\u201d l'efficacia nel 73.7% del casi trattati con Azelastina Spray Nasale e nel 55.5% di quelli trattati con Cetirizina. Entrambi i trattamenti sono stati ben tollerati e non si sono rilevati effetti collaterali.

In response to the availability of an OTC non-sedating antihistamine, many managed care organizations are reevaluating which if any prescription antihistamines should remain on formulary. From a managed care perspective, determining which of the remaining prescription antihistamines results in the greatest patient satisfaction with allergy treatment would be informative. We report on a weighted cross sectional survey (n = 10,023) delivered online to a sample of allergy sufferers in the U.S. during the month of December 2002. Two segments were identified for analysis: patient who were dissatisfied with loratadine and converted to desloratadine (Clarinex; n = 61), and patients who were dissatisfied with loratadine and converted to fexofenadine (Allegra; n = 211). The two segments were compared along a series of measures that the literature suggests are related to treatment satisfaction. The survey found that two of the satisfaction measures differentiated desloratadine converters from fexofenadine converters (p <.05): mean sum of self-reported adverse events and nighttime awakening due to allergy symptoms. For the remainder of satisfaction measures though, patients who were dissatisfied with loratadine reported equal duration of coverage and satisfaction with desloratadine as fexofenadine. When severity of disease was controlled for in the analysis, a pattern emerged suggesting greater levels of satisfaction amongst loratadine dissatisfied patients who converted to desloratadine. Point estimates suggest a consistent pattern favoring desloratadine patient satisfaction, with statistically significant results reported for sum of adverse effects, nighttime awakening due to symptoms, symptom severity just prior to the next dose, and overall satisfaction (p < 0.05). On average, patients who were dissatisfied with loratadine reported equal or better satisfaction with desloratadine as fexofenadine. Patients with severe allergic rhinitis reported greater satisfaction when converted from loratadine to desloratadine than fexofenadine for select satisfaction measures. These results suggest that if managed care intends to position prescription antihistamines as second line for OTC loratadine treatment dissatisfaction, desloratadine is a useful treatment alternative. These findings, while informative to formulary decision-makers, must be interpreted with caution. Only through head-to-head controlled clinical trials can differences in efficacy and safety be established.", "outbound_citations": ["12635578", "12575624", "10090440", "9600500", "10169526", "9134062", "9042068", "9020417", "1525732", "3339191", "7315270", "PMC1336335"], "inbound_citations": ["23242759", "21356091", "20477072", "16259582", "16329713"], "label": "1"}

Group 2, 13 subjects (7 male, 6 female) received levocabastine 2 puffs BID on each nostril during tbe same time. A nasal symptoms score, nasal peal: flow vid eosinophils in a nasal smear were performed before and after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no statistical differences in age, weight, height and arid duration of symptoms. Both groups showed improvement of symptoms via nasal peak flow with no differences between them (intergroup); nasal eosinophils remained unchanged. We for third statistical differences pre vid postreatment in each group (intragroup): Group 1, nasal congestion p = 0.002, ocular itch p = 0.01, sneezing p = 0.007, nasal secretion p = 0.01, nasal itch O = 0.009, total points O = 0.0005. Group 2, nasal congestion O = 0.02, ocular itch p = 0.05, sneezing p = 0.01, nasal secretion p = 0.01, nasal itch p = 0.04, total points p = 0.005. Significant differences were found in nasal peal' flow in Group 1 (p = 0.01) but no differences in eosinophils between file two groups. Side effects: 3 subjects in Group 1 (drowsiness, 1 appetite increase said 1 rhinorrea with epistaxis) vide 1 in Group 2 sensation of facial edema.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBofil drugs are effective the clinical relief of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis in children vied levocabastine has less side effects.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

As a result, symptoms ranging from sneezing and itching to severe nasal obstruction may require pharmacotherapy. However, product labels state that medications for allergic rhinitis should be avoided during pregnancy due to lack of fetal safety data, even though the majority of the agents have human data which refute these notions. We present a systematic and critical review of the medical literature on the use of pharmacotherapy for the management of allergic rhinitis during pregnancy. Electronic databases and other literature sources were searched to identify observational controlled studies focusing on the rate of fetal malformations in pregnant women exposed to agents used to treat allergic rhinitis and related diseases compared with controls. Immunotherapy and intranasal sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn) and beclo-methasone would be considered as first-line therapy, both because of their lack of association with congenital abnormalities and their superior efficacy to other agents. First-generation (e.g. chlorpheniramine) and second-generation (e.g. cetirizine) antihistamines have not been incriminated as human teratogens. However, first-generation antihistamines are favoured over their second generation counterparts based on their longevity, leading to more conclusive evidence of safety. There are no controlled trials with loratadine and fexofenadine in human pregnancy. Oral, intranasal and ophthalmic decongestants (e.g. pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine and oxymetazoline, respectively) should be considered as second-line therapy, although further studies are needed to clarify their fetal safety. No human reproductive studies have been reported with the ophthalmic antihistamines ketorolac and levocabastine, although preliminary data reported suggest no association between pheniramine and congenital malformations. There are no documented epidemiological studies with intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. budesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone) during pregnancy; however, inhaled corticosteroids (e.g. beclomethasone) have not been incriminated as teratogens and are commonly used by pregnant women who have asthma. In summary, women with allergic rhinitis during pregnancy can be treated with a number of pharmacological agents without concern of untoward effects on their unborn child. Although the choice of agents in part should be based on evidence of fetal safety, issue of efficacy needs to be addressed in order to optimally manage this condition.", "outbound_citations": ["9564799", "9209810", "9176542", "9259911", "9048526", "9397043", "8876549", "8948544", "7697274", "10780893", "8400627", "1533958", "2330234", "2906890", "2426027", "4010751", "6650593", "6838070", "7152436", "7241780", "7254912", "6158106", "7403786", "443241", "632475", "922327", "337991", "841482", "4948652", "4396080", "5422985", "13986750", "13747167", "13259314", "13050274", "14800179", "20998220", "7747265", "3982720", "3738592", "943896", "4131054", "6117389", "7887360", "3912192"], "inbound_citations": ["31759180", "30239057", "28210286", "27087030", "26601995", "26500933", "24523594", "22826069", "15537368", "12921487", "21737041", "19752567", "19530991", "21151812", "18265995", "18081563", "18707192", "18034353", "16442692", "17234117", "16443141", "16443148", "15857273", "16048356", "15576899", "15181224", "15035567", "12854627"], "label": "1"}

The potency of the prokinetic drug cisapride to block I(Kr) appears to be similar to that of terfenadine (IC(50) about 50 nmol/l).

Eighteen healthy young male volunteers received mizolastine 10 mg, or cetirizine 10 mg or placebo once daily for 7 days with a 1-week wash-out interval. An oral dose of ethanol or ethanol placebo, given 2 h after dosing on days 5 or 7 of each treatment period, was administered to achieve a peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.7 g/l then maintained for 1 h by two further doses of ethanol. Driving ability and psychomotor performance were evaluated using actual and simulated driving tests, critical flicker fusion threshold (CFF), adaptive tracking and divided attention (DAT) tasks. Ethanol produced a significant decrement in all tasks up to 5.5 h after administration: an increase in steering movements of 4.6, in lateral deviation of 0.45 m, in braking reaction time of 80 ms, in driving test and DAT performance of + 3.2; and a decrease in CFF and in tracking speed of 2.6 m.s-1. Neither mizolastine nor cetirizine significantly impaired driving ability or arousal (CFF) compared with the placebo. However, both drugs significantly impaired DAT performance 6:00 h post-dose (increase of + 2.1 for mizolastine and + 2.4 for cetirizine). The tracking speed was significantly decreased 7:50 h after mizolastine administration (-1.3 m.s-1) and more consistently from 1:30 to 7:50 h after cetirizine administration (-1.4 m.s-1). No significant adverse interaction, i.e. potentiation, occurred between ethanol and either antihistamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "outbound_citations": ["1505611", "1358620", "7875184", "1355427", "2971550", "2903059", "6418551", "8703650", "7756096", "7982120", "7909915", "7913608", "8056991", "28634740", "7903309", "1360807", "1354949", "1680760", "1684274", "1854375", "1981354", "2574627", "2562944", "3403955", "2885365", "4087910", "6098293", "6525331", "6525328", "6120713", "27204", "7867678", "7510611"], "inbound_citations": ["34826511", "28622592", "26999510", "25782469", "23956994", "11270939", "11700776", "22185045", "20685608", "20735428", "19740132", "19601724", "18797375", "17602789", "17288686", "16389668", "15286093", "15312146", "14977391"], "label": "1"}

Therefore, treatment with daily ASA is a significant therapeutic option for patients afflicted with AERD.

No study has been performed to determine whether orally administered H1 antihistamines can reduce the number of coughs induced by stimulation of cough receptors in non-asthmatic patients with chronic dry cough. METHODS: The effect of loratadine (10 mg) on the number of coughs induced by ultrasonically nebulised distilled water (UNDW) was examined in 10 patients with nasal disease and in seven patients with unexplained chronic cough using a randomised, double blind crossover method. Eleven normal volunteers were also studied. Each subject inhaled UNDW for one minute, and the numbers of coughs during the one minute inhalation and the 30 seconds following it were counted. RESULTS: There was no difference in the results of pulmonary function tests performed before and one minute after UNDW inhalation for either patients or normal subjects. There was also no significant difference between the results of pulmonary function tests before or after oral administration of loratadine. Loratadine significantly reduced the number of coughs in patients with nasal disease and in those with unexplained chronic cough, but not in normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The H1 antihistamine loratadine reduces cough induced by UNDW. The release of histamine may contribute to the chronic cough in patients with unexplained chronic cough or nasal disease.", "outbound_citations": ["7648374", "8049818", "8186064", "8306050", "8214994", "8339807", "8100726", "7686799", "1756847", "2090473", "1695070", "1698159", "2139858", "2567371", "2523301", "3053580", "2967164", "3689630", "2868172", "6437001", "6465626", "6204835", "6696320", "6407371", "6867982", "7168651", "7224353", "7316283", "3090916", "8319163"], "inbound_citations": ["30540903", "30306744", "24671376", "23928798", "23497684", "24490443", "20359123", "17169594", "17540788", "16936230", "15589973", "14512269", "14651723", "14564346", "12757448"], "label": "0"}

In the UK, for example, successful applications for product licences for medicines containing new active substances include, as a safety database, information on a median number of 1480 (range 129\u20139400) patients [1]. Most of these patients will have been carefully chosen to have only one disease being treated with one drug. Few, if any of them, will be typical of the patients likely to receive the drug once it has been marketed. \n \nThe identification of uncommon, even if serious or lethal, adverse reactions from such a small number of highly selected patients is unlikely. This led the Committee on Safety of Drugs (the forerunner of today's Committee on Safety of Medicines) to conclude that \u2018It is well recognised that no drug which is pharmacologically effective is without hazard. Furthermore not all hazards can be known before a drug is marketed: neither tests in animals nor clinical trials in patients will always reveal all the possible side effects of a drug. These may only be known when the drug has been administered to large numbers of patients over considerable periods of time\u2019. The Committee on Safety of Drugs Annual Report [2] which contained these remarkable conclusions was for 1969/1970. Thus, for almost 30 years it has been recognised that drug safety in clinical practice cannot depend solely upon pre-marketing data. \n \nThe backbone of the post-marketing techniques that have been developed to survey the use of newly marketed drugs in large populations is provided by the hypothesis-generating methods, including spontaneous adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting and prescription-event monitoring (PEM). The findings of such studies can be confirmed or refuted by hypothesis-testing techniques, such as case-control or cohort studies or randomised controlled clinical trials. \n \nComputerised clinical data are currently available from completed PEM studies of 58 newly marketed medicines and, as shown in Table 1, these studies have an average cohort size of 10 624 (median 11 081; range 1371\u201317 329) patients. Thus, PEM frequently enlarges the available safety database on newly marketed medicines. It also provides information on the \u2018real-world\u2019 use of these medicines: the data show the age, sex and geographical distribution that typifies the everyday clinical use of these drugs in general medical practice. \n \n \n \nTable 1 \n \nDetails of 58 complete PEM studies. \n \n \n \nThis paper briefly reviews the methodology of PEM and the current and planned activities that relate to this technique.", "outbound_citations": ["11037919", "15073952", "15073748", "9579888", "15073780", "9022432", "15073799", "8881946", "1998766", "PMC1669038", "0", "PMC2125673"], "inbound_citations": ["35209830", "33892716", "29042382", "26951203", "26435982", "26092496", "26097813", "25645637", "25376637", "25022829", "24788801", "24439689", "24257065", "22701822", "21958008", "21544847", "21247830", "20531042", "19886114", "19173342", "19124389", "19123926", "18507657", "18523760", "19026023", "18840020", "18019047", "17927296", "18690951", "17078102", "15976815", "15968034", "15948943", "15953293", "15842305", "15778419", "15842952", "15661578", "15278327", "15260887", "15455585", "15068407", "14748811", "15141995", "15154826", "12867585", "14551305", "14513661"], "label": "0"}

For this purpose, 10 atopics with allergic rhinitis were entered into a double\u2010blind crossover study in which they received either placebo or loratadine (20 mg/day orally) for 8 days separated by a 7\u2010day washout period. Blisters were induced on both forearms on day 7 of each treatment period, and were unroofed on day 8 and covered with plastic skin chambers. Chamber fluids were collected during 7 h after 1\u2010h incubation with anti\u2010IgE or control IgG. Intradermal challenge with histamine and anti\u2010IgE was performed at the same occasion. As compared to placebo treatment, loratadine inhibited the immediate WFRs to anti\u2010IgE by 35% (wheal) and 65% (flare), respectively (P < 0.01), and corresponding reactions to histamine challenge by 50% and 70% (P<0.001), respectively. Moreover, the initial phase (0\u20102 h) of the LPR induced by anti\u2010IgE was attenuated by up to \u223c60% (P < 0.001) during loratadine treatment. Thereafter, no inhibition of the LPR was observed. The magnitude and time course of histamine release into skin chambers was virtually the same after loratadine and placebo treatment, with a peak during 0\u20101 h and a progressive decline during the following 2 h. Accumulation of \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin, reflecting extravasation of large plasma proteins, also peaked during the first hour and was unaffected by loratadine during the 8\u2010h observation period. Moreover, loratadine did not reduce the anti\u2010IgE\u2010induced recruitment of eosinophils or other subtypes of leukocytes. Altogether, loratadine inhibited both the WFRs to histamine and anti\u2010IgE and the initial phase of the IgE\u2010mediated LPR. However, loratadine did not express anti\u2010inflammatory activity with respect to mast\u2010cell mediator release or leukocyte recruitment. The latter findings are in contrast to the action of loratadine in allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, suggesting that the actions of loratadine may be organ specific and that the effects of loratadine cannot always be extrapolated from one tissue to another.", "outbound_citations": ["7687510", "8319163", "8267692", "1383310", "1382132", "1443450", "1724592", "1673976", "1863902", "2148176", "1695070", "1973069", "2566879", "2471717", "2469708", "2461406", "2899102", "2887304", "942051"], "inbound_citations": ["24471751", "23742030", "11270939", "16423053", "15383082"], "label": "1"}

Odds ratio was calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Twenty-four controlled studies met the inclusion criteria with more than 200,000 participating women. The summary odds ratio of major malformations associated with antihistamines taken during the first trimester was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.60-0.94). This analysis indicates that H1 blockers used mainly for morning sickness during the first trimester do not increase the teratogenic risk in humans and may, in fact, be associated with a protective effect. More study is needed to verify the possibility that by preventing vomiting, antihistamines may ensure better metabolic conditions to the fetus and thus may reduce some birth defects. Alternatively, it is possible that pregnancies characterized by vomiting are associated with better outcome due to other reasons, such as hormonal status or placental function. Women suffering from morning sickness which is not controlled by nonpharmacological methods can safely use antihistamines.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36410997", "35996152", "35131140", "33816205", "33031909", "31599013", "30099124", "30504245", "29706359", "27209471", "28115431", "27878468", "28070660", "27986189", "27986190", "27701665", "30716232", "27731292", "27610445", "26658682", "26628289", "26348534", "26239325", "25267280", "25369643", "25125986", "24947638", "24829004", "24798673", "24527481", "25654792", "24323370", "24565715", "23863612", "23730028", "22876404", "22553987", "22541697", "22629082", "10804035", "12004303", "22085059", "21925002", "21737041", "12405123", "21601783", "21601782", "21424548", "21361848", "20974461", "21151729", "20463270", "19879515", "19261546", "19161158", "19127765", "18752885", "18662584", "18474699", "18707192", "18541949", "17967157", "17304027", "16860879", "16945050", "16328314", "16015020", "15703536", "16048356", "15646303", "15327608", "15181224", "12952140", "15035567", "12939685", "12839108"], "label": "1"}

It is highly active in vitro against pathogens causing atypical pneumonia (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella spp.) and has similar activity to other macrolides against Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae is susceptible or intermediately susceptible to clarithromycin alone, but activity is enhanced when the parent drug and metabolite are combined in vitro. Absorption of clarithromycin is unaffected by food. More than half of an oral dose is systemically available as the parent drug and the active 14-hydroxy metabolite. Pharmacokinetics are nonlinear, with plasma concentrations increasing in more than proportion to the dosage. First-pass metabolism results in the rapid appearance of the active metabolite 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin in plasma. Clarithromycin and its active metabolite are found in greater concentrations in the tissues and fluids of the respiratory tract than in plasma. Dosage adjustments are required for patients with severe renal failure, but not for elderly patients or those with hepatic impairment. Drug interactions related to the cytochrome P450 system may occur with clarithromycin use. In addition to the standard immediate-release formulation for administration twice daily, a modified-release formulation of clarithromycin is now available for use once daily. In dosages of 500 to 1000 mg/day for 5 to 14 days, clarithromycin was as effective in the treatment of community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections in hospital and community settings as beta-lactam agents (with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor), cephalosporins and most other macrolides. Clarithromycin was similar in efficacy to azithromycin in comparative studies and is as effective as and better tolerated than erythromycin. Adverse events are primarily gastrointestinal in nature, but result in fewer withdrawals from therapy than are seen with erythromycin. Clarithromycin provides similar clinical and bacteriological efficacy to that seen with beta-lactam agents, cephalosporins and other macrolides. It offers a cost-saving alternative to intravenous erythromycin use in US hospitals and is available in both once-daily and twice-daily formulations. The spectrum of activity of clarithromycin against common and emerging respiratory tract pathogens may make it suitable for use in the community as empirical therapy of respiratory tract infections in both children and adults.", "outbound_citations": ["8726002", "8820476", "8607519", "8741237", "7477159", "7548513", "7655131", "7499006", "7789484", "7782252", "7866659", "8031821", "8222794", "8285618", "7691518", "8243035", "8222870", "8360133", "8331208", "8097709", "8396087", "8478311", "1379907", "1532615", "1328138", "1830354", "1827095", "1827107", "1976065", "2140331", "2140546", "2527301", "7532933", "7486901", "1474166", "18611736", "1489191", "7847111", "7876634", "2140330", "8746608", "8182010", "8225636", "2140547", "7563004", "8458040", "8422851", "8225637", "1429335", "1535579", "10160469", "7925906", "8239578", "1835689", "7574530", "8191116", "8928641", "8182011", "7695313", "1387301", "8404922", "8370320", "1827098", "10130382", "8449054", "7634925", "7532134", "1827106", "8904108", "7871933", "7527329", "8983882", "8645810", "8371127", "8672003", "8723468", "8527549", "7850212", "7782109", "8329504", "1838978", "8295816", "7588090", "7788958", "7940695", "8546130", "1324650", "1453146", "7667050", "1828461", "1535578", "8453184", "8787907", "1827105", "8056694", "7667982", "8540719", "1684980", "1531484", "8031063", "8396085", "8537264", "8262876", "1827096", "8763594", "7726492", "8565421", "8408732", "1827102", "8737228", "1425738", "7979292", "8031048", "7796357", "7970952", "8229150", "1468430", "1839381", "9158749", "8086541", "8257127", "1489187", "1827104", "9002099", "10140526", "8607732", "8807050", "8225634", "8367199", "8111512", "8370491", "7628991", "7695310", "8239186", "7888564", "8295815", "8040139", "8313865"], "inbound_citations": ["35617322", "35523718", "34458952", "34447818", "33743592", "31820397", "30881064", "24032596", "21679791", "24825996", "22716469", "19909895", "19414584", "18785191", "18094220", "17936632", "18038913", "17174508", "15760428", "17523763", "15497665", "15497666", "15308279", "15225854", "14996517", "12973819", "12795777", "12846341"], "label": "0"}

Following each dose, subjects were required to perform a series of tests of cognitive function and psychomotor performance at 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h post dose. The test battery included critical flicker fusion (CFF), choice reaction time (CRT) and assessment of subjective sedation (LARS). Overall levels of activity were monitored by means of wrist mounted actigraphs throughout each of the 24 h experimental periods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFexofenadine at all doses tested was not statistically different from placebo in any of the tests used and loratadine did not cause any significant impairment of cognitive function. Significant impairments were found following promethazine. Promethazine caused a significant reduction in CFF threshold and this effect was evident up to 12 h post dose (P<0.05). There was a significant increase in recognition reaction time at 3 and 6 h post promethazine administration, and the drug caused a significant (P<0. 002) increase in the percentage of 'sleep-like' activity from actigraph records during the daytime.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFexofenadine at doses up to 180 mg appears free from disruptive effects on aspects of psychomotor and cognitive function in a study where the psychometric assessments have been shown to be sensitive to impairment, as evidenced by the effects of the verum control promethazine 30 mg.", "outbound_citations": ["11111489", "9525444", "9433369", "9396979", "7645684", "7982120", "7939118", "8104017", "8100479", "1455130", "1683192", "1967919", "6230888", "6107116", "7466128", "40568", "1106446", "10.1007/BF00981126", "2878812", "PMC1364557", "1684274", "PMC1430040", "2568212", "7875184"], "inbound_citations": ["36986050", "35833202", "35562767", "34727966", "31783781", "29532516", "28314658", "27531858", "26999510", "27671681", "25501360", "24346808", "23643576", "21880544", "21797930", "11270939", "11700776", "22712629", "17181374", "22130869", "21368620", "20685608", "18985628", "19032616", "18782118", "18570226", "21436982", "18410464", "17854242", "17333131", "16890992", "17136293", "16174671", "16834833", "16522330", "16945882", "16313283", "16086364", "16178497", "16197669", "15255990", "15286093", "15049392", "15152896", "14696020", "14582817", "14582814", "12952112"], "label": "0"}

Twenty\u2010four hours after the last dose of each treatment, histamine skin prick tests were performed (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 mg/mL), and wheal and flare responses were measured. All active treatments produced significant inhibition of the wheal responses compared to placebo (P < 0.001). Wheal response inhibition was significantly better with 20 mg of ebastine compared with 10 mg of ebastine and 10 mg of cetirizine. In a comparison to histamine concentrations required to produce a wheal surface area of 10 mm2, 20 mg of ebastine was also significantly better than ebastine 10 mg and cetirizine (P > 0.001), and 10 mg ebastine was significantly better than cetirizine (P > 0.05). Highly significant (P > 0.001) effects on the flare response were observed with each active treatment compared to placebo, with no difference between groups. The frequency of adverse events, primarily somnolence, was similar among the four treatment groups.

A serologic mediator of whealing has been demonstrated in 50-60% of patients with chronic urticaria, and autoantibodies against the high affinity IgE receptor or IgE have been detected in about half of these patients. The demonstration that chronic urticaria is frequently autoimmune has encouraged a more aggressive therapeutic approach, with the use of immunomodulatory drugs.A step-by-step approach to the management of chronic urticaria is proposed, based on our personal experience and review of current medical literature, identified through Medline research and hand searching in medical journals. The non- or low-sedating H(1) receptor antagonists (antihistamines), such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine and, more recently, levocetirizine, desloratadine and ebastine, represent the basic therapy for all chronic urticaria patients. Older sedating antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine, may be indicated if symptoms are severe, are associated with angioedema, and if the patient is anxious and disturbed at night.Corticosteroid therapy with prednisone or methylprednisolone can be administered for a few days (7-14) if urticarial symptoms are not controlled by antihistamines and a rapid clinical response is needed. In cases of relapse after corticosteroid suspension, leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, should be tried. In our experience, remission of urticarial symptoms can be achieved in 20-50% of chronic urticaria patients unresponsive to antihistamines alone. When urticaria is unremitting and is not controlled by combined therapy with antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists, prolonged corticosteroid therapy may be needed. Long-term corticosteroid therapy should be administered at the lowest dose able to control urticarial symptoms, in order to minimize adverse effects. In a few patients, however, high-dose corticosteroid therapy may have to be administered for long periods. In these patients, immunosuppressive treatment with low-dose cyclosporine can be started. This type of treatment has a corticosteroid-sparing effect and is also generally effective in patients with severe, unremitting urticaria, but requires careful monitoring of cyclosporine plasma concentration and possible adverse effects. Other immunomodulating drugs that have been tried in chronic urticaria patients include hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, sulfasalazine and methotrexate, but their efficacy has not been proven in large controlled studies. Warfarin therapy may also be considered in some patients with chronic urticaria and angioedema unresponsive to antihistamines.", "outbound_citations": ["11720006", "9635612", "12653169", "12209099", "12124416", "12100225", "11842307", "11796852", "11837570", "11799375", "11692119", "11764297", "11576078", "11678862", "11641254", "11547745", "11544471", "11531806", "11468002", "11350316", "11307031", "11243502", "11411930", "11097328", "11097330", "10984379", "10931124", "10982225", "10951147", "10972091", "10719307", "10753032", "10726745", "10550755", "10541429", "10400855", "10442538", "10359911", "10341322", "10233264", "10069884", "10209703", "10025750", "9819309", "9564821", "9517916", "9536230", "9449513", "9140522", "9152563", "8893110", "8675625", "8543747", "8651031", "7897151", "7687607", "7683772", "1373787", "1571267", "1810983", "1683883", "1723343", "1979796", "2172351", "2166915", "2135669", "2754146", "3146372", "2448392", "3307890", "3491100", "3718848", "3782654", "3973307", "6371104", "6116728", "367422", "872832", "1100092"], "inbound_citations": ["31166404", "24262692", "23692555", "19170406", "18517070", "16894531", "17331756", "16310530", "16734502", "14999392", "14524269"], "label": "1"}

Our study aims were 1) to define the prevalence of acid reflux induced cough in the general community, 2) to examine the ability of esophageal testing to identify gastroesophageal reflux related cough, and 3) to assess the utility of omeprazole in a chronic cough algorithm.Methods:Patients with chronic cough of unknown etiology, who were mostly from the community, were evaluated. Subjects underwent a chest x-ray, methacholine challenge test, and empiric trial of postnasal drip therapy, and completed daily cough symptom diaries subjectively evaluating cough frequency and severity on a graded scale of 0\u20134 (combined maximum 8). After excluding other causes of cough, the remaining patients underwent esophageal and pH testing. Those testing positive were randomized to omeprazole 40 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 12 weeks. Follow-up was 1 yr.Results:A total of 71 patients were screened; 48 were excluded. Twenty-three patients were evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux disease; six (26%) were eventually determined to have an acid-related cough. Of these patients, 17 had a positive pH test, six (35%) of whom showed a striking improvement or resolution of their cough during omeprazole treatment which was sustained for up to 1 yr. Six had a negative pH test, none of whom responded to omeprazole therapy. No significant differences were seen between responders (n = 6) and nonresponders (n = 11) for demographic factors, baseline symptom frequency and duration, or physiological parameters (motility/pH).Conclusions:Acid-related chronic cough was present in 26% (six of 23) of patients evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Esophageal testing does not reliably identify patients with acid induced chronic cough responsive to proton pump inhibitor therapy. We suggest that the best diagnostic and therapeutic approach, after excluding asthma and postnasal drip syndrome, is empiric treatment for 2 wk with a high dose proton pump inhibitor.", "outbound_citations": ["9725800", "9649457", "9625401", "9625124", "9136821", "9076302", "8792686", "8759655", "8759656", "8610725", "7503099", "8214994", "8222816", "10166751", "1446469", "2009795", "2203264", "2178528", "2817591", "7224353", "7366233", "1176724", "5829828"], "inbound_citations": ["35912160", "35300295", "35184616", "34267675", "34170625", "32811427", "31996267", "31914979", "31624050", "31275669", "31160182", "30597577", "29373438", "29470322", "29033267", "29016626", "28661900", "27614002", "27381074", "27383119", "27312992", "27739267", "25906028", "26498387", "25359162", "25628004", "25685756", "25383203", "25109844", "25006456", "24789125", "24752628", "24671376", "24466449", "24221340", "23881666", "23590893", "23117307", "23460143", "23452632", "23435747", "24390944", "23166570", "23483833", "22837875", "22442097", "21777340", "22242022", "14871170", "16869343", "16335856", "16335860", "22340375", "21695583", "21292019", "28839612", "21210893", "21703098", "21482834", "20932505", "21307014", "21249664", "21204887", "21083673", "21126692", "20600028", "20493461", "20385478", "20697188", "19826278", "20015104", "19740116", "20002704", "20533126", "19745761", "19649547", "19957784", "19063984", "19138751", "19161872", "18825333", "19809852", "18506466", "18641054", "18645525", "18399856", "18424325", "18424326", "18194498", "18728712", "17999650", "18214605", "18029434", "17978817", "17897577", "17669289", "17511916", "17577320", "17545276", "17458425", "17374150", "17295933", "16787744", "17269993", "17354108", "17069583", "17345932", "16936230", "16928254", "16631423", "16718833", "16473810", "16483269", "16542278", "16440422", "16428715", "16428719", "17273585", "16428697", "17063301", "16330475", "16303032", "16024554", "16270907", "16270937", "16162955", "16042662", "16056094", "15923255", "15722244", "15753524", "15784098", "15684281", "15709918", "15152964", "15564084", "15564088", "15516662", "15554989", "15383751", "15316405", "15358710", "15324380", "15223877", "15208586", "15082609", "15047960", "12822861", "15026893", "14645983", "14615671", "14615670", "12917229", "14514949", "12928092", "12928079", "12928099", "12928078", "12885989", "12823154"], "label": "0"}

Docetaxel with prophylactic oral antihistamine was administered at a dose of 50 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion on days 1 and 8 every 21 days and patients were randomized to receive methylprednisolone (40 mg days -1, 0, 1, 7, 8, and 9 of each cycle) (arm A) or no methylprednisolone (arm B).\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-eight patients (34%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 23% to 45%) achieved on objective response. The median time to disease progression and median overall survival time were 5 and 13.5 months, respectively. In total, 415 cycles of docetaxel were administered (arm A: N = 219, median = six; arm B: N = 196, median = five). The most common toxicity observed was grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, which occurred in 79% of patients. Clinically significant nonhematologic side effects included skin reactions and asthenia. In an intent-to-treat analysis, patients who received methylprednisolone premedication had a delayed onset of FR (median time to onset of FR: arm A, 84 days; arm B, 62 days; P = .01) and received a higher median cumulative dose of docetaxel before the onset of FR (arm A, 333 mg/m2; arm B, 215 mg/m2; P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of skin toxicity between the two arms.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDocetaxel, at this dose and schedule, has definite antitumor activity in pretreated MBC patients. Moreover, this is the first randomized trial to show that corticosteroids have a favorable impact on docetaxel-induced FR.", "outbound_citations": ["8636752", "8558221", "8523050", "8604451", "8523051", "8562183", "8745348", "7752272", "7912725"], "inbound_citations": ["37286589", "37261188", "36980577", "36303832", "33742240", "33582937", "33191320", "33070263", "33057999", "33096756", "32685295", "32547188", "28776478", "29759565", "28189568", "28965634", "27997437", "27164855", "26786788", "27042088", "26535615", "26351611", "25940996", "25933700", "25822016", "24740483", "25500718", "25045694", "24904223", "25089112", "24831279", "24625881", "24388742", "24559438", "23990250", "24096092", "23986880", "23244676", "24158075", "22782959", "28210121", "22433221", "21863309", "21920729", "22811858", "21750197", "21698408", "21636536", "21187510", "27964533", "19648099", "19567400", "19516888", "19354063", "19201649", "19331213", "18423779", "17936403", "18728853", "18373855", "17636328", "17159596", "16996111", "16933153", "16291774", "16234823", "15840125", "15858439", "15668278", "15355903", "15340375", "15277270", "15266221", "15151674", "14770432", "14767617", "15078005", "12164689", "14661041", "12875604", "12820771"], "label": "0"}

Eight volunteers were enrolled in this four\u2010arm, double\u2010blind, cross\u2010over, randomized study.

All 3 doses of mizolastine were more effective than placebo in suppressing wheal and flare reactions, and the antihistamine activity was highest at both the 10\u2010 and 15\u2010mg dose levels. The effect on the flare reaction appeared within 1 hour, reached a maximum effect 4 hours after administration, and persisted for as long as 24 hours. The relative changes in wheal and flare areas were correlated with mizolastine trough plasma levels on day 5. Safety was satisfactory in all groups.

Assessment was by subjective symptom scoring of three nasal symptoms namely; sneezing, rhinorrhoea and nasal blockage. Difference between pre treatment and post treatment mean symptom scores was used as degree of improvement for statistical analysis and this formed the primary efficacy parameter. Adverse effects namely; anticholinergic effects, gastrointestinal effects and drowsiness were assessed following treatment. The results showed that loratadine was significantly better than Vit. C. alone (P = 0.0002) and chlorpheniramine was also significantly better than Vit. C. alone (P = 0.039). However, loratadine was significantly better than chlorpheniramine P = 0.046.

We found 16 studies throughout the literature.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLarge, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials with definitive conclusions (grade A trials) have not been performed. Two grade B trials (small, rigorous, randomized trials with uncertain results due to moderate to high alpha or beta error) refuted the use of antihistamines in relieving pruritus. One grade B trial supported the efficacy of antihistamines in relieving pruritus. All remaining trials (grade C) lacked placebo controls or randomization, or contained fewer than 20 patients in each treatment group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough antihistamines are often used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, little objective evidence exists to demonstrate relief of pruritus. The majority of trials are flawed in terms of the sample size or study design. Based on the literature alone, the efficacy of antihistamines remains to be adequately investigated. Anecdotally, sedating antihistamines have sometimes been useful by virtue of their soporific effect and bedtime use may be warranted.

Twenty normal healthy volunteers underwent nasal challenge with either histamine or bradykinin, 100 micrograms to 1000 micrograms, and responses were assessed by acoustic rhinometry. A further 20 subjects received identical nasal challenges and responses were assessed by active posterior rhinomanometry. 3. On a subsequent occasion, the subjects challenged previously with histamine, were given the selective H1-receptor antagonist, cetirizine, 10 mg orally, 3 h before repeat nasal challenge with histamine, 100-1000 micrograms. Again, responses were assessed by active posterior rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry. 4. The acoustic reflection measurements and the nasal airway resistance measurements showed comparable, significant dose-related changes in nasal patency to both histamine and bradykinin. Pretreatment with cetirizine blocked the histamine-induced change in nasal patency as measured by both methods. 5.

Therefore, our objective was to investigate the effect of pretreatment with the antihistamine fexofenadine on the incidence of allergic side-effects during ultrarush immunotherapy with bee venom.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 57 patients with a history of systemic allergic reactions to honeybee stings and positive diagnostic tests (skin tests, serum specific IgE to honeybee venom) were investigated. Bee venom immunotherapy was started with an ultrarush protocol and patients were randomized to pretreatment with either fexofenadine 180 mg or placebo on days 1, 8, 22, and 50 of the protocol. Local and systemic allergic side-effects were registered.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-four patients completed the study, 28 on fexofenadine and 26 on placebo pretreatment. On day 1, large local reactions were significantly reduced in both extension and duration by fexofenadine pretreatment (P<0.025). Systemic allergic side-effects on the whole were not reduced. However, the symptoms pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema occurred less frequently with fexofenadine (P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPretreatment with fexofenadine during venom immunotherapy reduces local allergic reactions and generalized symptoms of the urticaria and angioedema type.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["28748641", "24267369"], "label": "0"}

The study included 36 healthy volunteers (18--50 years, mean age = 32 years; 9 males). The objective measurement was the cutaneous reactivity to increasing concentrations of histamine (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 mg ml(-1)) administered by prick tests. The reactivity was evaluated by the wheal and flare areas (mm2). The AUC (area under curves) values of the wheal and flare areas as a function of the log2 transformed histamine concentration were calculated for each subject and treatment, and compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA highly significant treatment effect was evidenced both for wheal and flare responses (P = 0.0001). This indicates the good activity of both cetirizine 10 mg and mizolastine 10 mg in inhibiting skin wheal and flare reactions to histamine. In addition, the mean AUC values significantly differed between cetirizine and mizolastine (64.8 and 117.8 log2 (mg ml(-1)) x mm2 for wheal, and 939.4 and 2340.8 for flare, respectively; P = 0.0001), with a superior activity of cetirizine than mizolastine at 24 h after intake both on wheal and flare responses. The tolerance of cetirizine and mizolastine was good. The severity of the adverse events was never more than 'moderate', 'fatigue' being the most frequent reported symptom [cetirizine (6 subjects), placebo (3), mizolastine (5)], followed by 'somnolence' [cetirizine (0), placebo (1), mizolastine (3)].

However, there is a need for new, non-anthracycline regimens that are active in patients for whom anthracyclines are contraindicated. The aim of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and recommended doses of docetaxel and vinorelbine as first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The pharmacokinetics of both drugs was also evaluated. Thirty-four women with first-line metastatic breast cancer were treated with docetaxel, 60-100 mg/m2 (day 1), and vinorelbine, 20-22.5 mg/m2 (days 1 and 5), repeated every three weeks and administered on an outpatient basis. Two MTDs were determined: MTD1 was defined at the dose level using docetaxel 75 mg/m2, and vinorelbine 22.5 mg/m2 DLT being a grade 3 stomatitis that was more related to the dose of vinorelbine than that of docetaxel. Therefore, the study continued with a fixed dose of vinorelbine, 20 mg/m2, and docetaxel 85-100 mg/m2. MTD2 was defined at the dose level combining docetaxel, 100 mg/m2, and vinorelbine, 20 mg/m2; DLTs were grade 3 stomatitis and severe asthenia. Fluid retention was observed in 41% of patients but was never severe or a reason for patient discontinuation. In comparison with historical experience, Daflon 500 did not seem to increase the efficacy of the three-day corticosteroid premedication by further reducing the incidence or severity of fluid retention. No significant neurotoxicity was observed and no patient discontinued the study due to this site effect. Activity was observed at all dose levels and at all metastatic sites, with an overall response rate of 71% (95% CI: 52.0%-85.8%). The median time to progression was 31.4 weeks (95% CI: 12-48 weeks) and median survival was 15.6 months (95% CI: 2.6-26.6 months). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vinorelbine were not modified between day 1 and day 3 when the two drugs were combined with the day 1 administration schedule used in this study. The recommended doses for phase II studies are docetaxel, 75 mg/m2 (day 1), plus vinorelbine, 20 mg/m2 (days 1 and 5), repeated every three weeks.

Three families of cytochromes \u2013 CYP1, CYP2, and CYP3 \u2013 perform the oxidative metabolism of drugs in humans. Within these families, five isoforms \u2013 CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19, CYP 2D6, and CYP 3A4 \u2013 account for nearly all the side-effects related to drug interactions [1, 2]. \n \nThe ability of macrolide antibiotics to interact with the biotransformation of some other drugs has been widely recognized, mostly with erythromycin and troleandomycin because these compounds have been marketed decades ago. Macrolides can induce their own hepatic biotransformation into nitrosoalkanes. These metabolites are derived from the metabolic oxidation of the \u2013N(CH3)2 group of the antibiotic to the corresponding \u2013NO group. Nitrosoalkanes subsequently form inactive CYP 3A4-iron-metabolite complexes (Figure 1) resulting in inhibition of the CYP 3A4-mediated catalytic activity [3]. This mechanism accounts for most of the drug interactions produced by macrolides [4]. \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \nMetabolism of macrolides. \n \n \n \nMacrolides differ in their abilities to bind to and inhibit the cytochrome P-450 isoform CYP 3A4 [3, 5\u20137]. These differences prompted von Rosenstiel & Adam [8] to classify macrolide antibiotics into three groups on the basis of data provided by in vitro experiments: \n \n \nGroup 1 agents include erythromycin and troleandomycin. Both drugs bind strongly to and inhibit markedly CYP 3A4. Since troleandomycin was withdrawn from the market many years ago, this drug will not be discussed further in the present paper; \n \n \nClarithromycin belongs to Group 2 agents. This drug exhibits lower affinity for CYP 3A4 as compared with erythromycin, and form complexes to a lesser extent; \n \n \nGroup 3 include azithromycin and dirithromycin. These compounds have been shown to interfere poorly with cytochrome P-450 system in vitro. \n \n \n \nClarithromycin has recently appeared to be similar to erythromycin in some drug interactions (e.g. with psychotropic agents), on the basis of the results of some clinical studies. Furthermore, a number of recent clinical case reports demonstrate that azithromycin and dirithromycin still exhibit some potential for drug interactions, although to a much lesser extent than that with erythromycin. \n \nThe discrepancy between what is expected from in vitro data and what may be observed in clinical practice underscores the well-known interindividual variability in the extent of cytochrome P-450 catalytic activity (as much as 10- to 20-fold). This pattern provides some explanation for why some patients appear to be more susceptible than others to a given drug\u2013drug interaction. \n \nIt is now clear that the heterogeneity among patients in the ability to perform P-450 metabolism of some drugs is largely the result of genetic factors [1]. Aside from the drug-induced induction/inhibition enzymatic processes, some other nongenetic factors probably contribute to interpatient differences in the liver content or activity of individual P-450: \n \n \nfor example, dietary differences may contribute significantly [9, 10]. \n \n \nCYP 3A4 activity may be non specifically depressed by debilitation or disease, e.g. liver cirrhosis [11] or celiac disease [12]. \n \n \nimportantly the infectious process by itsef can affect the activity of CYP; viral or bacterial pulmonary infections have been shown to depress CYP activity. In a sequential study conducted in 14 patients with fever and clinical pneumonia, antipyrine clearance was on average impaired by 36% [13]. Antipyrine elimination proceeds almost exclusively through hepatic biotransformation, and its metabolites are formed by at least 6 hepatic cytochrome P-450 isoforms, namely CYP 1A2, CYP 2B6, CYP 2C8, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C18 and CYP 3A4 [14]. Hence, the infection is likely to induce global inhibition of cytochrome P-450 catalytic activities. This stems probably from the release of endotoxin or interferon during the infection [15, 16]. Conceivably, the combination of interferon- or endotoxin-related CYP depression and the macrolide-induced inhibition of the CYP 3A4 isoform might result in an enhanced metabolic interaction. \n \n \n \nAn additional factor that may contribute to individual variability in the extent of drug interactions of pharmacokinetic type is the involvement of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Drug-induced changes in expression of this protein may overlap changes at the level of CYP catalytic activities. \n \nP-gp is an ATP-dependent efflux drug transporter that is constitutively expressed in normal tisues including the gastrointestinal epithelium, the canalicular membrane of the liver, the kidney and capillary endothelial cells in the central nervous system [17, 18]. P-gp appears to play a key role in absorption, distribution and elimination of many anticancer agents as well as other drugs such as digoxin or cyclosporin [19, 20]. Many P-gp inhibitors are also inhibitors of CYP 3A [21]. However, Wandel et al.[22] have demonstrated recently that there is no significant correlation between the ability of the P-gp inhibitors to inhibit P-gp and their ability to inhibit CYP 3A. In the case of macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin has been shown to reverse significantly multidrug resistance in cell-lines, which retain a higher expression of P-gp than the drug-sensitive parental cells [23], suggesting an inhibitory effect of the macrolide on P-gp expression. Also, clarithromycin appears capable of reducing the renal clearance of digoxin through inhibition of P-gp in the kidney epithelial cell [24]. \n \nWhile the involvement of P-gp in some pharmacokinetic drug interactions is an emerging issue, there is no further information at present on the role of this protein in macrolide\u2013associated drug interactions. However, the interaction of some macrolides with cyclosporin might be partially explained by inhibition of P-gp (seebelow). \n \nThe present review addresses those macrolide\u2013induced drug interactions (at the CYP level) that have been reported recently and shown to result in potentially serious side-effects in patients. Emphasis is placed on drug interactions involving the relatively recent and widely used macrolides clarithromycin, dirithromycin, and the azalide azithromycin because the last comprehensive reviews available on drug interactions of macrolides were published in 1995 [8, 25]. Following these reports, important drug interactions have emerged (e.g. with cisapride or pimozide) and some others, initially thought to be rare or dubious, have been substantiated or clarified (e.g. with benzodiazepines or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors).", "outbound_citations": ["10594487", "10543749", "10463589", "10411543", "10466907", "10084418", "9951426", "9972380", "9834046", "9757151", "9728893", "9728898", "9695727", "9593146", "9496419", "9131953", "9296238", "9250566", "9220046", "9066944", "9024381", "9029762", "9014207", "8880291", "8657260", "8826581", "8681486", "8646822", "8629881", "8786569", "8607732", "8549032", "8602374", "7586927", "8547740", "7554700", "7576262", "7628179", "11850697", "7663035", "7613198", "7695465", "7828386", "8846621", "7617103", "7895598", "7955768", "8203907", "8038476", "8040106", "8028152", "7977898", "8453848", "8227485", "8103797", "8391300", "7681059", "8097709", "8452357", "8448972", "1359120", "1424418", "1430211", "1458129", "1384896", "1516957", "1511528", "1389941", "1739411", "1346993", "1931473", "2208899", "2568347", "2467560", "2706893", "2463300", "3282533", "3440106", "2444983", "2444839", "3748010", "4006370", "3877043", "6718483", "7031111", "901699", "PMC187650", "PMC1368449", "PMC89545", "PMC299375", "10213372", "7923304", "10.1046/j.1365-2125.1999.00099.x", "PMC2014310", "10.1016/s0163-7258(96)00140-4", "10.1006/abbi.1994.1259", "PMC1429084", "PMC1381361", "PMC443248", "PMC1386366", "PMC408477", "PMC2042733", "PMC1386415", "PMC105769", "1322467"], "inbound_citations": ["36976501", "36859332", "37119611", "36510033", "36528110", "36557690", "35855210", "35394123", "35456537", "34783261", "34827267", "34584985", "34080718", "34380260", "33982266", "33729874", "33940506", "33305414", "33276675", "33257051", "33312947", "33107218", "33078993", "33011243", "32779824", "32967779", "32674929", "32524862", "32511684", "32407272", "32242175", "32125889", "31998605", "31656654", "31127283", "30760118", "30457423", "29910089", "30001781", "29794203", "29667038", "30181852", "29571544", "29160119", "29279920", "29279924", "28832423", "27935260", "28602108", "28146011", "28288711", "27066084", "27076965", "25940043", "26792988", "26325561", "26389999", "26278678", "25855479", "25534598", "28453094", "25216238", "25450476", "24685313", "24429901", "25011542", "24346990", "23639598", "23873482", "23847265", "23453406", "22830954", "23513539", "22969171", "22461039", "22830464", "27121334", "22153939", "22078863", "21756423", "21679791", "22479165", "21508859", "21242274", "20608754", "19897389", "19939207", "20350633", "20171003", "19995277", "19909895", "19740401", "19207666", "19207665", "19242403", "19261952", "19728747", "19135918", "19419232", "18823302", "19075792", "18840369", "18331375", "18506169", "17992523", "18226256", "17061983", "17612953", "17407366", "17139496", "16755125", "16556082", "16410677", "16282513", "16007523", "16044339", "15883149", "15856433", "15545884", "15308279", "15225662", "15303459", "14749694", "17516719", "12928463", "12814973", "12742010"], "label": "0"}

Mometasone furoate was as effective as twice-daily beclomethasone dipropionate or once-daily fluticasone propionate in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis, and was as effective as twice-daily beclomethasone dipropionate and slightly more effective than once-daily oral loratadine in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Mometasone furoate was also as effective as twice-daily beclomethasone dipropionate or once-daily budesonide, and significantly more effective than placebo in the prophylaxis of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The onset of action of mometasone furoate was approximately 7 hours in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Mometasone furoate was as well tolerated as beclomethasone dipropionate, fluticasone propionate and budesonide in clinical trials, with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate and of limited duration. The most common adverse events associated with mometasone furoate therapy were nasal irritation and/or burning, headache, epistaxis and pharyngitis. Intranasal or oral mometasone furoate had no detectable effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in studies of < or = 1 year in duration.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMometasone furoate is a well tolerated intranasal corticosteroid with minimal systemic activity and an onset of action of < or = 7 hours.

Various noninvasive measurement techniques, i.e. 20-MHz sonography, laser-Doppler flowmetry, chromatometry using the Lab* system and computer-assisted planimetry, were applied to provide a quantitative evaluation of the wheal and the marginal erythema. Using these quantification methods, the development of the urticarial reaction 20 min after injection and its decline were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe urticarial reaction was reduced substantially under treatment with 10 mg loratadine over a period of 7 days. The methods we used could accurately quantify different aspects of the urticarial reaction noninvasively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAll of the chosen measurement techniques are widely recognized. For objective assessment of the urticarial reaction with high-frequency ultrasound, we recommend the measurement of the distance between skin entrance echo and fascia since the demarcation of the wheal is often impossible by ultrasound. In order to improve comparison of results of various workgroups in the future, we therefore suggest the use of the selected combination of noninvasive procedures as a standard for evaluating the efficacy of H1 receptor blockers.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["23919086"], "label": "0"}

The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of days with no or only mild symptoms: at all doses, cetirizine appeared to be more effective than placebo, but a significant difference was reached only in the 10\u2010mg group (difference in medians of 22%; P= 0.016). The test of linearity was significant (P= 0.026) for the percentage of asymptomatic days. The investigators\u2019 assessments at each visit scored the symptoms in the placebo group higher, i.e., more severe, than in the active groups, the 10\u2010mg dose causing the greatest reduction in symptoms. Adverse events were infrequent and generally mild or moderate in severity. It was concluded that cetirizine at a 10\u2010mg, once daily dose could be used to treat effectively 6\u201312\u2010year\u2010old children with perennial allergic rhinitis.", "outbound_citations": ["8353660", "8353659", "8220804", "8452318", "1979794", "1981354", "3475550", "6204835", "13986750"], "inbound_citations": ["36090559", "33894089", "33198523", "30214250", "23867423", "22794678", "23120659", "18695846", "17020424", "14977391"], "label": "0"}

The lesions typically last less than 24 hours and are usually pruritic. In 1983, Christensen and Maibach summarized the theory behind the use of histamine H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) in clinical dermatology. These agents remain the mainstay of treatment for urticaria. This article reviews the medical literature on the effectiveness of antihistamines in urticarial syndromes, including acute, chronic idiopathic and the physical urticarias. Older antihistamines, such as chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine, are effective in the treatment of urticarias, but they also have marked sedative and anticholinergic effects. Newer nonsedating antihistamines (second-generation antihistamines) have been developed that have reduced adverse effects because they do not cross the blood-brain barrier; these agents (acrivastine, cetirizine, loratadine, mizolastine, fexofenadine, ebastine, azelastine and epinastine) cause significantly less sedation and psychomotor impairment than their older counterparts. A review of the literature reveals that there are few studies which document the efficacy of second-generation antihistamines in the treatment of acute urticaria, a biologic entity that usually resolves within 3 weeks. We did not identify controlled studies that suggested superiority of any antihistamine in the treatment of acute urticaria. Loratadine or cetirizine, and possibly mizolastine, appear to be treatments of choice for chronic idiopathic urticaria. For symptomatic dermatographism, the combination of an antihistamine and an H2 antagonist, e.g. chlorpheniramine and cimetidine, appears to be effective. Very few studies have been conducted on the use of antihistamines in the treatment of cold, cholinergic, and pressure urticaria. Antihistamines are the mainstay of urticarial therapy. This evidence-based review suggests that there are efficacy differences between newer, nonsedating antihistamines and older agents in some forms of the disorder. Clearly, further well-controlled clinical trials in larger numbers of patients are needed to clarify the role of these agents in the treatment of urticaria.", "outbound_citations": ["10894968", "10887969", "10564333", "10442525", "10209703", "10188144", "9274644", "8893110", "8869688", "8763431", "8721536", "8993958", "8703650", "7622644", "7604646", "7530629", "1445478", "1535019", "1684515", "1979796", "1979471", "1977781", "2147912", "1977507", "2107240", "1967919", "2404434", "2574555", "2565098", "2569996", "2569997", "2901993", "3126220", "3346487", "2467496", "2892806", "3307890", "2885854", "2875904", "3886724", "6480953", "6139191", "6120506", "7011357", "7372956", "6102102", "475988", "31121", "334082", "5287036"], "inbound_citations": ["32281695", "31913218", "31365240", "27545733", "27578075", "26239325", "23664252", "24766875", "21534521", "19697300", "18091593", "17632232", "17883909", "16890992", "16310530", "15353166", "15023012", "14754652", "14977391"], "label": "0"}

The three H1 receptor antagonists significantly inhibited antigen/mitogen\u2010induced PBMC proliferation in a concentration\u2010dependent manner. Allergen\u2010specific T\u2010cell responses in allergic individuals were similarly inhibited. The effect of the three drugs was also tested in cultures of mononuclear cells derived from adenoid tissue. The growth kinetics were investigated using spontaneously proliferating cell lines to examine whether the inhibition was caused by general toxicity. Three cell lines, HCT 8 (an ileocaecal adenocarcinoma) RPMI 8866 (B\u2010cell line) and 166 A2 (T hybridoma) were tested. Loratadine (<0.03 \u03bcM) and dexchlorpheniramine (<0.62 \u03bcM) altered the kinetics of HCT 8 and RPMI 8866, respectively. When testing RPMI 8866 and 166 A2, the growth\u2010inhibitory effect of terfenadine and loratadine could be neutralized by addition of cell culture filtrate from RPMI 8866 or 166 A2. These culture filtrates are rich in soluble low\u2010affinity IgE receptor (sCD23) and IgE\u2010binding factor (IgEBF), respectively.

Their usefulness, however, is sometimes compromised by undesirable central nervous system (CNS) side effects such as daytime sedation and anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth. Second-generation, nonsedating antihistamines (terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and cetirizine hydrochloride) are just as effective as the potent first-generation antihistamines such as hydroxyzine. Yet they do not cause the CNS and anticholinergic side effects seen with the older agents. Cardiovascular side effects, which have been recently reported with terfenadine and astemizole, are dose related and rare, generally occurring in patients who overdose or who take concomitant medications that increase serum antihistamine levels. The second-generation antihistamines also offer twice daily and once daily dosage schedules, which are more convenient than the two- to four-times daily schedules of the older agents.

Histamine was applied iontophoretically to the forearm skin and the following parameters were assessed thereafter: weal and flare size, itch intensity and the extension of the area of alloknesis ('itchy skin') around the application site. Naltrexone had no effect on the vascular histamine reactions 'weal' and 'flare', whereas cetirizine abolished the weal reactions and greatly diminished the flare reactions. Both naltrexone and cetirizine significantly diminished histamine induced itching. In contrast to placebo and cetirizine, naltrexone abolished alloknesis completely in four of 15 volunteers and in the others alloknesis was greatly reduced after naltrexone.

In the SLIT group, drug consumption dropped significantly throughout the pollen season (P<0.02).

To elucidate the involvement of histamine to ACh\u2010provoked vasoreactions and sensations, we applied a selective H1\u2010antagonist (cetirizine) 3 h prior to the ACh\u2010administration. Solutions of acetylcholine (ACh, 0.55 M) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP, 1.5x10\u22125 M) were injected (10 \u03bcl) intracutaneously into the volar forearm of 14 healthy subjects and 14 atopic eczema (AE) patients. The substances were applied as single stimulus as well as in combination. Sensations evoked by the stimulation were recorded using 2 visual analog scales (VAS). Vasoreactions were analyzed with the new technique of computer assisted video image analysis. With this method we measured the dynamics of the flare development and the extension of the final flare size independent of the observer's assessment. In control subjects the development and extension of the observer's assessment. In control subjects the development and extension of the final flare size was almost similar, regardless whether ACh and VIP were applied in combination or separately. Compared to healthy controls, after injection of ACh, VIP and the combination of VIP and ACh smaller flare sizes were recorded in AE patients. After VIP was given, the control subjects reported pruritus, which was significantly augmented compared to AE patients. In contrast, controls reported a burning pain after the injection of ACh, whereas AE patients felt predominantly pruritus. Itch sensation after the combined application of VIP and ACh was significantly elevated in AE patients. Consequently, we assume that mediators of sudomotor neurons, i.e., VIP and ACh meet in AE patients apparently sensitized nociceptive primary afferents and induce exaggerated itch, pain and flare responses. When pretreated with the selective H1\u2010antagonist cetirizine before ACh was injected, pain and erythema due to ACh was diminished in healthy controls. In contrast, cetirizine did not influence the size of erythema and the magnitude of sensation in AE patients. We conclude, that the release of histamine is not involved in ACh\u2010induced erythema and pruritus in AE. These data provide evidence that pruritus can be elicited in atopic eczema by a cholinergic, histamine independent mechanism.", "outbound_citations": ["9533572", "9315918", "9339388", "9249274", "9109369", "9487015", "8726636", "8834827", "8651018", "7750000", "7671389", "7918008", "1282289", "1718119", "1977505", "2158020", "2267295", "2674298", "3018693", "3008974", "6498089", "6190501", "7065681", "6167109", "6103537", "81468", "5359457", "4185582", "13909906"], "inbound_citations": ["32147148", "31408048", "27118771", "26944891", "25861775", "24568861", "23849311", "23722916", "23250574", "21918536", "21122466", "20454993", "20574599", "18691920", "18606082", "17598031", "16950827", "17015491", "16297002", "16297000", "15983470", "15109974", "14623706", "14527736"], "label": "0"}

Moreover, significant improvements were observed for a range of secondary endpoints assessing symptoms, exacerbation rates, beta-agonist usage and quality of life. Concomitant administration of montelukast (5 mg/day) and inhaled budesonide (200 microg twice daily) resulted in a trend towards an increase in FEV(1) (p = 0.06, primary endpoint) and a statistically significant reduction in both as-needed beta(2)-agonist usage and the percentage of days with asthma exacerbations compared with budesonide plus placebo. No significant differences were observed in asthma-related quality of life between the two groups. During clinical trials both improvements in lung function and reductions in as-needed beta(2)-agonist usage were generally observed within 1 day after initiation of therapy in children 2 to 14 years of age with persistent asthma. Data from a randomized, nonblind trial in 6- to 11-year-old children and a 6-month extension to this trial suggest that both compliance to therapy and patient satisfaction are greater for montelukast than for either inhaled sodium cromoglycate or inhaled beclomethasone. In addition, patients and parents preferred oral montelukast over sodium cromoglycate. In 2- to 5-year-old children with persistent asthma, montelukast (4 mg/day) treatment resulted in significant improvements in a range of outcomes, such as as-needed beta(2)-agonist usage, symptom scores and percentage of days with asthma symptoms, as assessed during a randomized, double-blind trial primarily designed to assess tolerability. Data from small randomized, double-blind trials suggest that montelukast reduces exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in 6- to 14-year-old children. Montelukast is generally well tolerated. The frequency of adverse events in montelukast-treated children of all ages was comparable to that in patients receiving placebo. Oral montelukast has shown efficacy as a preventive treatment for asthma during clinical trials in children aged 2 to 14 years. The drug offers benefits over more standard therapies such as inhaled sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil in terms of compliance and convenience. In addition, the drug offers significant benefits when added to inhaled corticosteroids (according to secondary endpoints). Montelukast offers an effective, well tolerated and convenient treatment option for children with asthma.", "outbound_citations": ["10673245", "10673230", "10673231", "10673225", "10992554", "10588604", "10550753", "10491447", "10514017", "10471986", "10378985", "10378986", "10391245", "10335014", "15073927", "10228127", "10234597", "10199381", "10024248", "10564696", "10051701", "9860804", "9843112", "9824399", "9817745", "9824404", "9738728", "9723658", "9800746", "9679847", "9643848", "10099058", "9466639", "9515583", "9624291", "9429741", "9351905", "9329408", "9311616", "9249244", "9196086", "9105062", "9105516", "9127275", "8887574", "8828530", "8614425", "7634860", "7621356", "8111568", "8096945", "1666630", "2169776", "2821857", "6463929", "417690", "95924", "4210567", "4116963", "7551372", "10518843", "10069868", "9555757", "11050259", "10903240", "10588996", "9895400", "10587413", "10929920", "10984399", "10434229", "10804041", "11402629", "10051694", "10069892", "9584338", "11779723", "11759189", "11158473", "9678834", "11027744", "10673241", "11421935", "10508811", "11422148", "11159698", "11310649", "10833470", "10753254", "11167954", "10228122", "9475326", "8977504", "11533366", "11343045"], "inbound_citations": ["31920289", "24932181", "24089325", "23450606", "22958412", "19432972", "19151602", "23282887", "19476052", "17623754", "16707408", "16835707", "16262558", "16157732", "15102869", "15076638", "12910578"], "label": "0"}

In addition to their medical examinations, the 12 study volunteers rated subjective complaints in a diary program on 4 examination days, for a duration of 4.5 hours every 15 minutes at each visit. This resulted in 903 data sets consisting of five questions each, or 4515 data points total.

Moreover, the benefit of electronic reminders for protocol compliance is clearly demonstrated. Our findings support the results found in the literature we reviewed. For more than 16 years, mobile computers have been supporting the implementation of clinical trials. Our review of 27 articles out of more than 100 clinical trials in which mobile computers have been used elaborates on the advantages and problems of this technology. We give a comprehensive overview of the various technologies as used in different settings, and then discuss the methodology of using mobile devices in comparison to traditional methods, the considerations that need to be made and things to be avoided in order to conduct a successful clinical trial with mobile tools.

There has been no previous attempt to standardize an SPT for routine commercial availability. OBJECTIVE: To validate the use of an SPT method to discriminate effectiveness and adverse events while comparing drugs/doses in patients with allergic rhinitis. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, 4 paired\u2014period, multiple-crossover SPT. SETTING: Academic and commercial investigative sites. PATIENTS: Thirty-six patients with allergic rhinitis were evaluated for the most appropriate treatment; 6 of these participated in 2 different SPTs. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment of symptoms of allergic rhinitis by comparing either loratadine with chlorpheniramine maleate or loratadine with placebo in a series of SPTs. MEASUREMENTS: Effectiveness endpoints were selected from a modern, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved new drug application. Expected adverse events were directly solicited; unsolicited events were also recorded. Total signs and symptoms cumulatively included sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, teary eyes, and itchy eyes. Quality of life was measured by the most bothersome symptom and the patient's global evaluation. RESULTS: Of 42 initiated SPTs, 40 (95%) provided complete data and 1 (2%) provided partial data, resulting in 41 (98%) evaluable tests. Thirty-one evaluable SPTs compared loratadine 10 mg/d with chlorpheniramine maleate 12 mg twice daily, and 10 SPTs compared loratadine 10 mg/d with placebo. Four of 31 SPTs (13%) showed significant superiority for loratadine over chlorpheniramine maleate and 5 of 31 (16%) for chlorpheniramine maleate over loratadine. Twenty-two of 31 (71%) showed parity performance between loratadine and chlorpheniramine maleate. Loratadine was significantly superior to placebo in 3 of 10 trials (30%), consistent with rates found in 3 pivotal group trials used for FDA approval (24%, 17%, and 0%). Sleepiness could be discriminated for loratadine versus placebo and for chlorpheniramine maleate versus loratadine. CONCLUSIONS: The allergic rhinitis SPT proved to be acceptable to patients, feasible to administer, and reproducible. It can statistically discriminate effectiveness and adverse events, serving as a useful, prognostic tool in community practice.", "outbound_citations": ["2879736", "9179098", "8133588", "2297206", "3057041", "2936958", "3924261"], "inbound_citations": ["31761797", "30193253", "29804057", "15808031"], "label": "1"}

Antihistamines are needed that cause no disruptive effects on cognitive and psychomotor function. It is essential that antihistamines maintain the integrity of the cognitive system, not only in ambulatory patients at increased risk of drug-induced traffic- or work-related accidents, but also in students and others whose cognitive or intellectual impairment may adversely affect their performance.Objective; The goal of this study was to investigate the acute effects of fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg, alone and with a \"social\" dose of alcohol, on subjective feelings of sedation and on a battery of objective measures related to driving a car. These measures included information processing, psychomotor speed, and reaction time in an on-the-road car-driving task. Hydroxyzine hydrochloride 50 mg was included in the study as a positive internal control to validate the sensitivity of the psychometri tests to nonspecific impairment. In this randomized, double-blind, 6-way, crossover study conducted at the Human Psychopharmacology Research Unit, Medical Research Centre (University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom), 18 healthy volunteers received fexofenadine 180 mg, hydroxyzine 50 mg, and placebo alone and with alcohol (0.3 g/kg body weight or approximately 0.43-0.50 g/L blood-alcohol concentration). Treatment periods were separated by a washout period of at least 6 days. Subjects performed tests of cognitive and psychomotor performance at 1, 3, and 5 and hours after dosing. The test battery included subjective ratings of sedation, critical flicker fusion (CFF), choice reaction time (including recognition reaction time [RRT], motor reaction time [MRT], total reaction time [TRT], and brake reaction time [BRT]. Eighteen healthy male volunteers (median age, 30.5 years [range, 23-44 years]) were entered into the study. Fexofenadine alone and with alcohol had no significant effect on performance compared with placebo and was not distinguishable from placebo in any of the objective or subjective tests at any point. However, impairment was evident following the administration of hydroxyzine. Hydroxyzine caused significant impairment in CFF (P < 0.05), RRT (P < 0.001), and TRT (P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Hydroxyzine with alcohol significantly disrupted performance on all of the above measures with respect to both placebo and fexofenadine (P < 0.05) as well as MRT (P < 0.001). No significant treatment effects on BRT were found. Fexofenadine 180 mg did not have disruptive effects on objective measures related to driving a car and aspects of psychomotor and cognitive function, even when combined with a dose of alcohol equivalent to 0.3 g/kg body weight, in a study in which the psychometric assessments were shown to be sensitive to impairment.", "outbound_citations": ["15286093", "1355427", "2886343", "12002730", "11703220", "11549210", "11349388", "12404608", "10848909", "10856168", "10831005", "10784544", "28672331", "10730552", "10632124", "10550734", "10550755", "10417497", "10444229", "10444226", "10444230", "10389553", "10472301", "9525444", "9066452", "1419261", "2285407", "2275638", "2229823", "2570798", "2887328", "2869766", "6230888", "7316007", "6107116"], "inbound_citations": ["33834510", "31783781", "29532516", "28622592", "26999510", "26239325", "25501360", "24766875", "23956994", "23474655", "22455874", "15631542", "22185045", "20685608", "18985628", "18609422", "18618902", "21436982", "18181241", "18336052", "18004007", "17883909", "17288686", "16174671", "16800414", "16834833", "16389668", "17357374", "16086364", "15548781", "15118806"], "label": "1"}

Pharmacy claims data for the six months after each intervention program was implemented were analyzed to determine changes in the market share and prescribing of the study drugs. After the intervention programs were implemented, the market share of fexofenadine increased from 18.9% to 65.2% at HMO A, from 14.8% to 21.0% at HMO B, and from 20.7% to 23.8% at HMO C. Loratadine's market share decreased from 62.3% to 8.7% at HMO A, from 67.5% to 58.6% at HMO B, and from 70.5% to 65.3% at HMO C. HMOs A, B, and C each had greater shifts in market share for fexofenadine and loratadine than the control HMO. Changes in prescribing followed a similar pattern for the 25 physicians at each HMO who had most frequently prescribed loratadine during the preintervention period. The average cost per antihistamine prescription decreased 22.3% at HMO A. Prescription costs continued to rise at HMOs B, C, and D. Mandating the use of fexofenadine produced a significant increase in its market share, reduced the cost of nonsedating antihistamines, and successfully influenced prescribing behavior. Voluntary programs had a more modest impact on market share and did not stop increases in prescription costs.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31721159", "27541699", "20635836", "16945882", "16173282", "15228372"], "label": "0"}

ECP levels in nasal secretions were investigated in all patients to determine the anti-inflammatory activity of both treatments. Cetirizine resulted very effective in the treatment of sneezing, itching and acqueous rhinorrea whereas not much effective on nasal obstruction. On the contrary, fluticasone, which acted effectively on nasal obstruction, resulted inefficacious on the other symptoms. The third group of patients achieved the best results on all four symptoms, including obstruction, which continued even after interrupting the treatment with fluticasone. The ECP levels were significantly reduced by both treatments. The side effects in all 3 groups were rare and not serious.

Nineteen (19) healthy male volunteers received either levocetirizine 5 mg (therapeutic dose), diphenhydramine 50 mg or placebo once daily for 5 consecutive days (3-way cross-over).

It is rapidly absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of between 40 and 50%. Food increases the absorption by 30 to 80%. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are linear over the clinical dosage range of 200 to 600 mg once daily. The mean elimination half-life ranges from 7.6 to 24 hours, which facilitates a once daily administration regimen. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are similar between patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy individuals. In humans, troglitazone undergoes metabolism by sulfation, glucuronidation and oxidation to form a sulfate conjugate (M1), glucuronide conjugate (M2) and quinone metabolite (M3), respectively. M1 and M3 are the major metabolites in plasma, and M2 is a minor metabolite. Age, gender, type 2 diabetes, renal impairment, smoking and race do not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of troglitazone and its 2 major metabolites. In patients with hepatic impairment the plasma concentrations of troglitazone, M1 and M3 increase by 30%, 4-fold, and 2-fold, respectively. Cholestyramine decreases the absorption of troglitazone by 70%. Troglitazone may enhance the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and/or transporter(s) thereby reducing the plasma concentrations of terfenadine, cyclosporin, atorvastatin and fexofenadine. It also reduces the plasma concentrations of the oral contraceptive hormones ethinylestradiol, norethindrone and levonorgestrel. Troglitazone does not alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, glibenclamide (glyburide) or paracetamol (acetaminophen). There is no pharmacodynamic interaction between troglitazone and warfarin or alcohol (ethanol).

Cetirizine (10 mg daily as a single dose) was administered to 22 patient for 45 days. On the other hand, FP (400 micrograms/day) was administered into each nostril twice a day in the remaining 21 patients for 45 days. Skin test was obtained from each patient before therapy. Total eosinophil count, eosinophil count in nasal smear, electrorhinomanometric investigation, PGE2 and ratio of LTC4 to LTD4 both in the serum and in the nasal secretions were determined before and after therapy. In addition, percentage of eosinophils, and mast cells count in the biopsy specimens taken from anterior edge of middle choncha were evaluated before and after therapy, and than the results were graded for each patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhen we compared the eosinophil count in nasal smear, eosinophil percentage and total eosinophil parameters between two groups, it was shown that FP was more effective than Cetirizine. On the other hand, when we compared the ratio of LTC4 to LTD4 in serum and nasal smear, level of PGE2 and mast cell and nasal airway resistance measured by ERM, there were non statistical difference between two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that FP and Cetirizine may be used alternatively in case of an adverse reaction to any of them.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["19765020", "16213915"], "label": "0"}

Injective and non-injective immunotherapy have been recognised as safe and effective but no evidence is currently available for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in patients sensitised to Ambrosia. This study was planned to assess the effects and the safety of SLIT in patients clinically sensitised to Ambrosia.\n\n\nMETHODS\n19 patients clinically sensitised to Ambrosia and treated with SLIT were compared to 14 patients treated only with drugs. Diary cards with symptoms and drug consumption were filled-in by patients during the pollen season whereas specific nasal challenge and skin prick test were run two months before and after the pollen season. Patients and doctors were also asked to express their subjective assessment about symptoms and drug consumption during the season.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSLIT-treated patients had less symptoms and a significantly minor drug intake (p = 0.04) as compared to untreated patients. Nasal challenge test improved significantly in the SLIT group (p = 0.0001) but not in the control group (p = 0.6875) with a significant difference between groups at the end (p = 0.0413) but not at the beginning of the trial (p = 0.213). The decrease in skin reactivity was significant in the control group (p = 0.0186) and highly significant in the SLIT group (p < 0.0001), with no difference between groups (p = 0.2987). Subjective assessment from both patients and doctors was favorable to SLIT (p = 0.0005 for symptoms; p = 0.0019 for drug consumption). Only one minor local side effect was registered during SLIT.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAccording to our data, SLIT in patients allergic to Ambrosia is safe and able to improve both subjective and objective parameters.", "outbound_citations": ["10550740", "10592467", "10505460", "10452766", "9700035", "9689338", "9314339", "9257784", "9207721", "8526180", "7551201", "2097894", "2476472", "2668381", "3759259", "3893674", "6501741", "6601670", "7042799", "6972401", "7386807", "956553", "4205187", "4107763", "4873833"], "inbound_citations": ["28243068", "19390236", "18430309", "16403616"], "label": "0"}

Secondary end points were drowsiness and other driving measures, including lane keeping and response to a vehicle that unexpectedly blocked the lane ahead.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants had significantly better coherence after taking alcohol or fexofenadine than after taking diphenhydramine. Lane keeping (steering instability and crossing the center line) was impaired after alcohol and diphenhydramine use compared with fexofenadine use. Mean response time to the blocking vehicle was slowest after alcohol use (2.21 seconds) compared with fexofenadine use (1.95 seconds). Self-reported drowsiness did not predict lack of coherence and was weakly associated with minimum following distance, steering instability, and leftlane excursion.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nParticipants had similar performance when treated with fexofenadine or placebo. After alcohol use, participants performed the primary task well but not the secondary tasks; as a result, overall driving performance was poorer. After participants took diphenhydramine, driving performance was poorest, indicating that diphenhydramine had a greater impact on driving than alcohol did. Drowsiness ratings were not a good predictor of impairment, suggesting that drivers cannot use drowsiness to indicate when they should not drive.", "outbound_citations": ["9801741", "9525444", "9003207", "9004377", "7749974", "7677241", "8264923", "8104017", "1800105", "1979799", "2286697", "1971741", "2910633", "3078045", "2892451", "2869766", "6617633", "6294215"], "inbound_citations": ["36693356", "34862952", "33809544", "34043307", "31753966", "29562970", "28988004", "30239057", "26999510", "26928292", "26802474", "27018419", "26053292", "25182353", "24766875", "24473486", "24433592", "22719016", "24406943", "23474655", "22806823", "22337782", "15362929", "21521134", "21431840", "21433074", "21364230", "22152505", "21105284", "20881402", "20618098", "20504144", "20380914", "20146728", "23282531", "20028354", "20437916", "20031005", "19745643", "19181876", "19081615", "18072125", "21436982", "18691297", "18662584", "18419620", "18253678", "18181241", "17507909", "18004007", "17883909", "17512862", "17539447", "17196194", "17288686", "17174216", "17053486", "17088121", "16174671", "16800414", "16370264", "16086364", "16015020", "15871585", "15231978", "15316570", "15317672", "15520133", "15536445", "15347340", "15286093", "15298795", "15159707", "15168099", "15176523", "15049392", "14742815", "14687330", "14668671", "12967550", "12802214"], "label": "1"}

We set out to compare their antihistaminic activity in the skin for 24 h in a double-blind, randomized cross-over trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe skin reaction to histamine administered by prick tests (100 mg ml(-1)) was measured by the surface areas of weals and flares for 24 h [before treatment, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 h after a single dose of levocetirizine (5 mg), desloratadine (5 mg) or placebo] in 18 healthy volunteers (34.8 +/- 9.4 years; 14 women). The areas under the curves (AUC) of the weal and flare areas as a function of time were compared by ANOVA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA highly significant overall treatment effect (P < 0.0001) was observed and both weals and flares were inhibited. The pairwise comparisons showed that the activity of levocetirizine and desloratadine was significantly superior to that of placebo (P < 0.0001), and the activity of levocetirizine was significantly superior to that of desloratadine (P < 0.0001). 'Total' weal inhibition (> or = 95%) occurred only with levocetirizine. Median values of maximal weal inhibition were 44.2% with placebo, 55.0% with desloratadine and 100% with levocetirizine. The time to maximal weal inhibition was 4 h (median value) for all three study drugs, but scattered over a wider range for desloratadine (3-24 h) than levocetirizine (2-4 h). With desloratadine, five of 18 (28%) subjects reached weal inhibition of at least 70% at between 3 and 10 h, whereas with levocetirizine all subjects [18/18 (100%)] reached this level of weal inhibition at between 1 and 3 h. The median duration of 70% weal inhibition was zero with placebo and desloratadine, and was 21.4 h with levocetirizine (P < 0.0001 between the three study drugs, and P < 0.0001 between the two active drugs). No uncommon adverse events were reported, and no subject withdrew from the study due to an adverse event.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study shows that the activity of levocetirizine in suppressing skin reactivity to histamine was clearly superior to that of desloratadine for 24 h after a single dose.

Serial blood and urine samples were collected for up to 48 h following the first and last doses of fexofenadine HCl. Fexofenadine and its R(+) and S(\u2212) enantiomers were analysed in plasma and urine by validated HPLC methods. Fexofenadine pharmacokinetics were linear across the 20\u2013120 mg dose range, but a small disproportionate increase in area under the plasma concentration\u2013time curve (AUC) (<25%) was observed following the 240 mg dose.

When applied on the skin or in the nose, bradykinin (BK) elicits inflammation that is poorly affected by previous H1-blockade. The aim of this study was to compare the possible effect of cetirizine (an H1-antagonist) on wheal and flare responses to BK, histamine, and compound 48/80 in atopic and healthy subjects.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, eight atopic and eight healthy subjects received cetirizine (10 mg/day) or placebo for 3 days before cutaneous tests. Intradermal tests (IDT) and prick tests (PT) were performed with BK (20 nmol/ml for IDT and 20 micromol/ml for PT), histamine (100 microg/ml IDT and 100 mg/ml PT), and compound 48/80 (100 microg/ml IDT and 100 mg/ml PT) as positive controls and saline as negative control. The skin responses were monitored by measurement of wheal and flare areas.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBK, histamine, and 48/80 induced wheal and flare reactions in all placebo-treated subjects. Histamine elicited larger wheal and flare reactions than BK and 48/80. IDT with BK induced four- to sixfold larger wheal and flare reaction than PT. No differences in BK-induced wheal and flare were observed between atopic and healthy subjects. In atopic subjects, cetirizine induced a significant reduction of flare reactions after the BK test (80% for IDT, and 94% for PT [P < 0.01]). Moreover, cetirizine reduced significantly BK-induced wheals by 70% for IDT (P < 0.01) and 65% for PT (P < 0.01). A similar inhibiting effect of cetirizine was also observed in healthy subjects.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings showed that the wheal and flare reactions induced by BK challenge were markedly inhibited by previous intake of cetirizine. The mechanism by which this effect is mediated cannot be established at present.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["28181317", "11270939"], "label": "0"}

Consistently effective interventions included dissemination of educational materials with drug samples, participatory clinical guideline development, group or one-to-one educational outreach, and enhanced patient-specific feedback.

Plasma concentrations of loratadine and desloratadine were determined at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after a single administration of 5 mg loratadine syrup to 18 healthy children (11 male, 7 female; 12 black, 5 white, 1 other; mean age +/- SD, 3.8 +/- 1.1 years; mean weight +/- SD, 17.4 +/- 4.4 kg). In addition, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was performed to assess the tolerability of 5 mg loratadine syrup after multiple doses. Loratadine (n = 60) or placebo (n = 61) was given once daily for 15 days to children with a history of allergic rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria. In the loratadine group, 27 boys and 33 girls (52 white, 8 black) were enrolled, with a mean age +/- SD of 3.67 +/- 1.13 years and a mean weight +/- SD of 17.2 +/- 3.8 kg.

Tolerability was assessed based on electrocardiographic results, occurrence of adverse events, changes in vital signs, and results of laboratory tests and physical examinations. The peak plasma concentrations of loratadine and desloratadine were 7.78 and 5.09 ng/mL, respectively, observed 1.17 and 2.33 hours after administration of loratadine; the areas under the plasma concentration-time curve to the last quantifiable time point for loratadine and desloratadine were 16.7 and 87.2 ng x h/mL, respectively. Single and multiple doses were well tolerated, with no adverse events occurring with greater frequency after multiple doses of loratadine than after placebo. Electrocardiographic parameters were not altered by loratadine compared with placebo. There were no clinically meaningful changes in other tolerability assessments.

In each study, subjects received three 10 day treatments in random sequence, separated by a 14 day washout period. The treatments were loratadine alone, cimetidine or ketoconazole alone, or loratadine plus cimetidine or ketoconazole. The primary study endpoint was the difference in mean QTc intervals from baseline to day 10. In addition, plasma concentrations of loratadine, DCL, and ketoconazole or cimetidine were obtained on day 10.\n\n\nRESULTS\nConcomitant administration of loratadine and ketoconazole significantly increased the loratadine plasma concentrations (307%; 90% CI 205-428%) and DCL concentrations (73%; 62-85%) compared with administration of loratadine alone. Concomitant administration of loratadine and cimetidine significantly increased the loratadine plasma concentrations (103% increase; 70-142%) but not DCL concentrations (6% increase; 1-11%) compared with administration of loratadine alone. Cimetidine or ketoconazole plasma concentrations were unaffected by coadministration with loratadine. Despite increased concentrations of loratadine and DCL, there were no statistically significant differences for the primary electrocardiographic repolarization parameter (QTc) among any of the treatment groups. No other clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of loratadine were observed as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (mean (90% CI) QTc changes: loratadine vs loratadine + ketoconazole = 3.6 ms (-2.2, 9.4); loratadine vs loratadine + cimetidine = 3.2 ms (-1.6, 7.9)), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLoratadine 10 mg daily was devoid of any effects on electrocardiographic parameters when coadministered for 10 days with therapeutic doses of ketoconazole or cimetidine in healthy volunteers. It is concluded that, although there was a significant pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ketoconazole or cimetidine and loratadine, this effect was not accompanied by a change in the QTc interval in healthy adult volunteers.", "outbound_citations": ["9268220", "9142059", "9142080", "9103502", "8690825", "8556569", "7554700", "7613198", "7697852", "7727886", "7952058", "8189766", "8028152", "8445813", "1526078", "1955133", "1677597", "1977935", "2900995", "2960701", "967655", "PMC1670151", "1676921", "1322467", "10.1016/s0140-6736(97)26018-6"], "inbound_citations": ["36779647", "35098100", "32360993", "32101533", "31519068", "30488793", "29574682", "29749249", "26960809", "25785934", "25589220", "25452254", "23574541", "22685217", "21797930", "19943707", "20945138", "19230596", "20210720", "19405975", "18442267", "18622814", "17968745", "16490584", "17357373", "15654717", "15932952", "15752381", "15692832"], "label": "0"}

Thirty-six asymptomatic patients suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis from house dust mite were randomized to this open two-period crossover study. Patients received the study medications for four days each. In each period, treatments were taken twice a day. On day 1 in each period, immediately after the first dose of medication, patients were challenged with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extract I in the Vienna Challenge Chamber for 5 h. Primary efficacy parameters were nasal congestion evaluated by digital analysis of nasal cavity photographs and nasal airflow. Furthermore amounts of nasal secretions, nasal and ocular symptoms were recorded. In addition, 5 independent Ear-Nose-Throat specialists also assessed nasal cavity photographs. Statistical analyses were conducted at the 5 % level of significance. Digital analysis of the nasal cavity photographs as well as nasal airflow measurements did not differentiate XMZ from CTZ/PSE. Ratings of the photographs of the nasal cavity emphasized the rapid onset of XMZ. No clinically relevant adverse events were recorded. This rapid onset of action but short-lived effect of topical xylometazoline 0.1 % should be balanced against the consistent and prolonged effect of systemic cetirizine/pseudoephedrine combination in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis as no significant differences between these 2 medications were noted regarding their decongestant properties.

Included studies: All randomised controlled trials that compared oral over the counter cough preparations with placebo in adults with acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection in ambulatory settings and that had cough symptoms as an outcome. Results: 15 trials involving 2166 participants met all the inclusion criteria. Antihistamines seemed to be no better than placebo. There was conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of antitussives, expectorants, antihistamine-decongestant combinations, and other drug combinations compared with placebo. Conclusion: Over the counter cough medicines for acute cough cannot be recommended because there is no good evidence for their effectiveness.

Both cetirizine and epinastine significantly inhibited the histamine-induced flare and wheal responses at 2 h after the oral administration when compared with placebo. The inhibitory effects of cetirizine and epinastine on the flare response lasted long until at 24 h, however, epinastine was less potent than cetirizine. The inhibitory effects on the wheal response was also clearly and significantly evident at 2-8 h by cetirizine and epinastine. At 24 h cetirizine only showed the significant inhibition on the histamine-induced wheal response. In contrast, epinastine seemed to exhibit the inhibitory capacity earlier than did cetirizine.

Before treatment, concentration-response curves were similar and threshold concentrations identical (0.57 mg/ml and 0.57 mg/ml for cetirizine and ebastine, respectively). Both treatments exerted a significant effect. However, cetirizine was significantly more efficient than ebastine 20 mg (P < 0.01 both for wheals and flares). After cetirizine, the threshold concentration inducing a 3-mm(2 )wheal was significantly higher (266 mg/ml) than after ebastine (77 mg/ml) (P < 0.01), and total inhibition of the wheal was obtained in 18 of 24 patients for cetirizine and in 4 of 24 for ebastine (P < 0.001).

The drugs usually appear to be extensively metabolized,mainly in the liver. Some second generation antihistamines are metabolized principally by the cytochrome P-450 microsomal enzyme system, mainly by the isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), although other isoenzyme,including CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, also may be involved. However,other second generation antihistamines appear to be only minimally metabolized in the liver. Serious cardiac effects (prolongation of the QT interval, arrhythmias, torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, arrest, hypotension, palpitations, syncope, dizziness, and/or death) have been reported rarely in patients receiving terfenadine or astemizole. Cardiotoxic effects ussually were associated with higher than recommended dosages and/or increased plasma concentrations of the drugs and their active metabolites. No clinically important adverse effects or changes in the QT intervals were reported after concomitant administration of ketoconazole with fexofenadine. Patients receiving an azole, antifungal, a macrolide, quinine or grapefruit juice also appear to be at substantial risk of such toxicity, probably secondary to interference with metabolism of the antihistamine. Second-generation H1 receptor antagonist have been studied extensively in the treatment of asthma. Many of these drugs have been reported to inhibit eosinophil and basophil chemotaxis and therefore might have an effect on the inflammatory reactions that characterise this disease. Safe use of antihistamines during pregnancy has not been established; therefore, the drugs should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant unless the potential benefits justify the possible risks to the fetus. Antihistamines should not be administered to premature or full-term neonates. Young children may be more susceptible than adults to the toxic effects of antihistamines.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["27986539", "23307606"], "label": "0"}

An additional objective was also to investigate the configurational stability of levocetirizine in vivo in humans. The study was performed in a randomized, two\u2010way cross\u2010over, single\u2010dose design with a wash\u2010out phase of 7\u2003days between the two periods. A total of 12 healthy male and 12 healthy female volunteers were included in the study. Bioequivalence can be concluded from the analysis of the pharmacokinetic parameters of levocetirizine when administered alone or as the racemate cetirizine. No chiral inversion occurs in humans when levocetirizine is administered, i.e. there is no formation of the distomer. When comparing the pharmacokinetic characteristics of levocetirizine and the distomer, the apparent volume of distribution of the eutomer is significantly smaller than that of the distomer (0.41 and 0.60\u2003L/kg, respectively). For an H1\u2010antagonist a small distribution volume can be considered as a positive aspect, both in terms of efficacy and safety. Moreover the non\u2010renal clearance of levocetirizine is also significantly lower than that of the distomer (9.70 and 28.70\u2003mL/min, respectively), which constitutes an additional positive aspect particularly as far as metabolism\u2010based drug interactions are concerned.

It was hypothesised that this variability may have been due to differences in the rates of metabolism of loratadine to its active form, desloratadine. This double blind, crossover study examined the effects of desloratadine in 12 healthy volunteers. Levocetirizine was used as a comparator. Desloratadine (5 mg), levocetirizine (5 mg) or placebo was taken orally 4 h before an intradermal injection of histamine (20 microL, 100 microM) or vehicle control into the forearm skin. Flare areas were assessed by scanning laser Doppler imaging before and at 30 s intervals for a period of 9 min. Wheal areas were measured by planimetry at 10 min. Itch was scored every 30 s for 5 min using a visual analogue scale. Following placebo administration, the mean (+/- SEM) wheal area at 10 min was 79.3 +/- 6.9 mm(2), mean flare area for the first 5 min following challenge 26.6 +/- 2.7 cm(2), and itch score for the same period 48.5 +/- 7.6%. The effects of desloratadine were variable between individuals, mean reductions in the wheal and flare areas being 17% (P = 0.033) and 12% (P = 0.036). Desloratadine did not reduce itch significantly. Levocetirizine was more consistent in its effects, mean reductions in wheal, flare and itch being 51%, 67% 78% respectively (all P < 0.001). A single dose of 5 mg levocetirizine produced more consistent and greater inhibitory effects on histamine-induced wheal, flare and itch than did 5 mg desloratadine.

A decrease in wheal and flare areas was observed following intake of both drugs compared with placebo controls. With the notable exception of 1 hr post dose wheal values, which were consistently smaller after epinastine, cetirizine was superior to epinastine for both wheal and flare at all other times. At the prick test site, treatment with epinastine and cetirizine accentuated the increase in blood flow induced by histamine. This reflects the decrease of the whealing but there was no significant difference between the two active test compounds. At 1 cm from the prick test site, the administration of both active treatments inhibited the increase of blood flow, and cetirizine showed a more potent inhibitory effect from 8 hr post dose. This reflects the reduction of the flare induced after histamine\u2010receptor activation of the axon reflex.

Such causality assessments are sometimes done by drug de-challenge and re-challenge. When the adverse effect is potentially serious, there is clearly an important decision to be made as to whether the re-challenge is justifiable and hence ethical. The recent controversy about the potential cardiotoxicity of fexofenadine, the fatalities associated with penicillin re-challenge and the fatalities associated with abacavir re-challenge highlight some of the potential serious risks of drug re-challenge. The associated important ethical issues are discussed. In particular, there is the need to ensure respect for the patient and to consider the scientific and social value of the re-challenge. A framework for evaluating and assessing the appropriateness of a particular drug re-challenge is proposed in the light of recent as well as long-standing discussions of drug re-challenge, patient informed consent and the ethics of human experimentation, in general. It is suggested that a drug re-challenge should be approached with the same rigour and standards of documentation as are currently required of clinical trials. Given the potential conflicts of interest inherent with any drug study, it is argued that the safeguards, as may be provided by scrutiny by an ethics committee, are necessary for a drug re-challenge. For the investigator contemplating the conduct of a drug re-challenge we would recommend the following: (i) a careful risk-benefit assessment as part of the decision-making process; (ii) careful scientific preparation, including appropriate expert support and emergency back-up facilities, if re-challenge is deemed necessary; (iii) the writing of a detailed protocol for independent approval and for safeguarding all concerned; and (iv) meticulous record keeping.", "outbound_citations": ["11368703", "10819955", "10466699", "10209990", "10459910", "9798614", "9761029", "9800751", "9652662", "9091822", "8977506", "8769215", "8649594", "7535875", "7697478", "7727055", "7939790", "2880069", "9652658", "9065574"], "inbound_citations": ["29160439", "20541691", "16867044", "12911412"], "label": "0"}

Mizolastine had a positive effect on angioedema (85% CI 95% [0.69-1.00]) of patients improved compared with 75% (CI 95% [0.59-0.91]) of the loratadine group and the differential reduction of the mean total duration of episodes in the mizolastine group was higher when compared with the loratadine group (from 13.7 +/- 33.5 hours on day 0 to 5.1 +/- 9.0 hours over the treatment period and from 8.2 +/- 8.8 hours on day 0 to 5.1 +/- 7.8 hours over the treatment period for mizolastine and loratadine, respectively). Prick test analysis demonstrated that both drugs caused a significant decrease of histamine-induced wheal and flare with no development of tolerance, with a significant superiority of mizolastine over loratadine for some histamine concentrations.

Data available at the time of the previous review in Drugs, together with more recent results, have clearly demonstrated that levocabastine nasal spray and eyedrops are clinically effective, have a rapid onset of action and are well tolerated in patients with nasal and/or ocular allergic conditions. Previous evidence indicating that topical levocabastine has efficacy similar to or better than that of topical sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn sodium) has been confirmed in more recent studies. Furthermore, results from a number of controlled clinical trials have also shown that topical levocabastine is at least as effective as oral terfenadine for the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Notably, topical levocabastine appears to be more effective than oral terfenadine in improving the severity of selected symptoms. Limited data indicating efficacy equivalent to that of oral loratadine, oral cetirizine or azelastine nasal spray will need to be confirmed. Data from several studies have shown that topical levocabastine has a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo, topical sodium cromoglycate or oral terfenadine. The main adverse events seen in patients treated with topical levocabastine are ocular irritation after application of eyedrops, and headache, nasal irritation, somnolence and fatigue after administration of the nasal spray. Administered doses of topical levocabastine, and subsequent plasma concentrations, are low, and the risk of systemic adverse events is therefore expected to be minimal. Thus, topical administration of levocabastine rapid and effective symptom relief with no apparent serious adverse events in patients with allergic rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis. Topical levocabastine is a useful alternative to topical sodium cromoglycate or oral terfenadine. Additional data supporting current evidence that topical levocabastine can provide more effective symptom relief than oral terfenadine, together with clarification of the relative efficacies of these agents in relation to varying pollen exposure, would help to further confirm its clinical potential. However, the results available to date suggest that the topical formulations of levocabastine are a valuable treatment option in patients with allergic rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis.", "outbound_citations": ["8549024", "18475684", "18475683", "18475686", "18475689", "7862419", "7950341", "7906926", "10779311", "1680537", "1672878", "1709851", "2575739", "8101534", "7894627", "7511378", "1354927", "7653738", "1685691", "7902022", "3046408", "7902024", "1677551", "2891316", "8101467", "7835196", "2572181", "1683189", "1354945", "7907347", "7909999"], "inbound_citations": ["35842185", "35631374", "34798284", "23280544", "22897673", "22410956", "18020525", "11303414", "22057880", "21832863", "21618886", "19209282", "18680729", "16701759", "14977764"], "label": "0"}

Most patients, however, use these medications as needed. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of as-needed use of H(1) receptor antagonists with that of intranasal corticosteroids in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a randomized, open-label, parallel-group study comparing the as-needed use of an H(1) receptor antagonist (loratadine) with that of an intranasal corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate) in the management of fall seasonal allergic rhinitis in the fall of 1999. Subjects kept a diary of their daily symptoms and were examined at enrollment into the study and biweekly for 4 weeks during treatment. Outcome measures were the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score, daily symptom diary scores, and the number of eosinophils and the levels of eosinophilic cationic protein in nasal lavage samples.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients in the fluticasone-treated group reported significantly better scores in the activity, sleep, practical, nasal, and overall domains (P<.05) of the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire. The median total symptom score in the fluticasone-treated group was significantly lower than that in the loratadine-treated group (4.0 vs 7.0; P<.01). After treatment, the number of eosinophils was significantly smaller in the fluticasone-treated group compared with the loratadine-treated group (P =.001). Eosinophilic cationic protein levels followed the same pattern, with a significant correlation between the levels of eosinophilic cationic protein and the number of eosinophils (r(s) = 0.70, P<.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs-needed intranasal corticosteroids reduce allergic inflammation and are more effective than as-needed H(1) receptor antagonists in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.", "outbound_citations": ["10756223", "9848901", "9860027", "9396645", "9338545", "8607960", "7677236", "7812543", "8308505", "8335858", "7693314", "2021881", "2212409", "3060511", "2438553"], "inbound_citations": ["37105599", "35947495", "35379997", "35283683", "36452536", "33685613", "33279881", "33275547", "33099546", "33049392", "33354149", "32707227", "32203003", "32628388", "31490223", "32176226", "31627910", "30032479", "28681969", "28532204", "27862336", "27527264", "26800187", "25620381", "24753507", "24708183", "24717886", "20718924", "20816182", "20540482", "20425504", "19589288", "18769200", "18662584", "18331513", "17414832", "16498847", "16213915", "16103690", "16120080", "16813032", "15746880", "15746881", "16329713", "15630154", "15005760", "12877448"], "label": "0"}

The effectiveness of first-generation antihistamines in blocking sneezing in colds may be due primarily to neuropharmacological manipulation of histaminic and muscarinic receptors in the medulla.", "outbound_citations": ["9402380", "9356796", "8729205", "8739607", "8120280", "8128400", "8227864", "8100479", "1317600", "1720601", "1922817", "1851657", "1750722", "2262647", "2139800", "2895909", "3357721", "3282216", "6175587", "659012", "898330", "1211469", "1183558", "20942090", "13559211", "13497324", "PMC474322", "2896128", "8492938"], "inbound_citations": ["33748342", "32133778", "26615034", "23391673", "23391674", "24490443", "22439725", "21294831", "20463825", "18237071", "17909896", "16517221", "16428717", "15842953", "15288679", "15482159", "14651723"], "label": "1"}

The clinical efficacy was evaluated as well.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFifty-one patients (mean age 27.4 years) suffering from rhinoconjunctivitis and/or mild-intermittent/mild-persistent asthma due to grass pollen were allocated to two groups receiving pharmacotherapy alone (n = 25) or pharmacotherapy plus IT in tablets (n = 26). A methacholine test was performed in asthmatic subjects out of the pollen seasons at baseline and after 3 years of treatment. Symptom scores and drug intake were evaluated during pollen seasons by a diary card.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA significant increase p = .01) in the PD20 at the methacholine test was observed in the IT group compared to the control group. A significant clinical improvement both for rhinitis (p = .001) and asthma (p = .001) was observed in the IT group, and this improvement was paralleled by a clear-cut reduction of drug intake (p = .001). An improvement of rhinitis symptoms without modification of drug intake was seen in the control group (p = .01) The treatment was well tolerated and no relevant side effect was reported during the 3 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe investigated local IT reduced the nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity. Furthermore, it was clinically effective and safe.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32926419", "32338477", "29803711", "26315994", "22502864", "11543692", "21848757", "21175592", "20976414", "20943066", "20441427", "20461969", "20041860", "23268425", "19944004", "18430309", "17924930", "17253469", "16942563", "17064648", "16675328", "15947473", "16318993", "15461603", "15474866", "15230823", "15281466"], "label": "0"}
