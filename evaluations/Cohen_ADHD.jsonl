Three hundred sixty-one patients from 26 North American centers entered this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R).

At end point, significant differences (p < 0.05, analysis of covariance) in adjusted mean changes from baseline were identified between the four highest doses of quetiapine and placebo for BPRS total, BPRS positive-symptom cluster, and CGI Severity of Illness item scores and between quetiapine 300 mg and placebo for SANS summary score. Differences between quetiapine and haloperidol were not significant. Dose-response modeling showed significant linear and quadratic functions of quetiapine dose for all primary efficacy variables. Notably, no significant safety concerns were identified as dose increased. Quetiapine was no different from placebo across the dose range studied regarding incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms or change in prolactin concentrations.

Design: Cohort study of outpatients using administrative data. Setting: 3 US Medicaid programmes. Participants: Patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine, haloperidol, risperidone, or thioridazine; a control group of patients with glaucoma; and a control group of patients with psoriasis. Main outcome measure: Diagnosis of cardiac arrest or ventricular arrhythmia. Results: Patients with treated schizophrenia had higher rates of cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia than controls, with rate ratios ranging from 1.7 to 3.2. Overall, thioridazine was not associated with an increased risk compared with haloperidol (rate ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.2). However, thioridazine showed an increased risk of events at doses \ue421600 mg (2.6, 1.0 to 6.6; P=0.049) and a linear dose-response relation (P=0.038). Conclusions: The increased risk of cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia in patients with treated schizophrenia could be due to the disease or its treatment. Overall, the risk with thioridazine was no worse than that with haloperidol. Thioridazine may, however, have a higher risk at high doses, although this finding could be due to chance. To reduce cardiac risk, thioridazine should be prescribed at the lowest dose needed to obtain an optimal therapeutic effect. What is already known on this topic Thioridazine seems to prolong the electrocardiographic QT interval more than haloperidol Although QT prolongation is used as a marker of arrhythmogenicity, it is unknown whether thioridazine is any worse than haloperidol with regard to cardiac safety What this study adds Patients taking antipsychotic drugs had higher risks of cardiac events than control patients with glaucoma or psoriasis Overall, the risk of cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia was not higher with thioridazine than haloperidol Thioridazine may carry a greater risk than haloperidol at high doses Patients should be treated with the lowest dose of thioridazine needed to treat their symptoms", "outbound_citations": ["11735846", "11735845", "11746322", "11497335", "11405770", "10909946", "11249502", "10939309", "10853872", "10744090", "8750398", "7760442", "8256780", "3411140", "6709306", "14000993"], "inbound_citations": ["36356202", "36709510", "36257205", "35524619", "35434255", "35287954", "34225211", "33681037", "32905878", "32402075", "32142077", "31053339", "31622875", "31439658", "31463053", "29697804", "30704263", "30658604", "31223470", "30528680", "30632082", "30292087", "30416734", "29552429", "28004385", "29054453", "29173600", "28674475", "28659221", "28489133", "28152633", "27521534", "25917167", "27657540", "27400984", "27061849", "26074405", "27435383", "27398296", "27150690", "26272741", "26651392", "23625911", "26132170", "26013175", "26094568", "25404197", "26174524", "25611192"], "label": "0"}

Six hundred twenty-nine subjects with CVD who smoked >/=10 cigarettes/day were randomised in a double-blind, multicentre study to receive bupropion SR (150 mg twice daily) or placebo for 7 weeks, with a follow-up of 52 weeks. Primary efficacy endpoint: continuous abstinence from smoking from weeks 4 to 7. Secondary endpoints: continuous abstinence (weeks 4-12, 4-26 and 4-52) and weekly point prevalence abstinence. All participants received brief motivational support. Safety was evaluated throughout the study.

Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: the direct switch group (N = 54) received only olanzapine, while the start-taper switch group (N = 54) received olanzapine and their usual antipsychotic in decreasing doses for the first 2 weeks. A successful switch was defined as completing 6 weeks of therapy without worsening of symptoms (Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale [CGI-S]) or extrapyramidal side effects (Simpson-Angus Scale). Overall efficacy was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and safety was assessed by recording adverse events and measuring vital signs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStatistically significant (p < .001) improvements from baseline to endpoint occurred in both switch groups in the CGI-S score and the PANSS total score and subscores. However, no significant differences were observed between the switch groups for any efficacy measure. Both techniques had comparable rates of successful switching (direct switch, 74.1% vs. start-taper switch, 67.9%). The frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between switch groups with no clinically significant differences in any laboratory value or vital sign.

Both switch groups showed statistically significant (p < .01) improvements from baseline to endpoint on the Simpson-Angus Scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nModerately ill Asian patients with schizophrenia may experience a decrease in symptom severity and improvement in extrapyramidal symptoms when switched from their current medication to olanzapine therapy.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33547471", "33198886", "28044008"], "label": "0"}

The sample for the relapse analyses consisted of 104 patients who responded to treatment of their index episode and were at risk for relapse.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive years after initial recovery, the cumulative first relapse rate was 81.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.6%-93.2%); the second relapse rate was 78.0% (95% CI, 46.5%-100.0%). By 4 years after recovery from a second relapse, the cumulative third relapse rate was 86.2% (95% CI, 61.5%-100.0%). Discontinuing antipsychotic drug therapy increased the risk of relapse by almost 5 times (hazard ratio for an initial relapse, 4.89 [99% CI, 2.49-9.60]; hazard ratio for a second relapse, 4.57 [99% CI, 1.49-14.02]). Subsequent analyses controlling for antipsychotic drug use showed that patients with poor premorbid adaptation to school and premorbid social withdrawal relapsed earlier. Sex, diagnosis, obstetric complications, duration of psychotic illness before treatment, baseline symptoms, neuroendocrine measures, methylphenidate hydrochloride challenge response, neuropsychologic and magnetic resonance imaging measures, time to response of the initial episode, adverse effects during treatment, and presence of residual symptoms after the initial episode were not significantly related to time to relapse.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is a high rate of relapse within 5 years of recovery from a first episode of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. This risk is diminished by maintenance antipsychotic drug treatment.", "outbound_citations": ["8866739", "8823344", "8541249", "7726309", "7866682", "7699611", "7916539", "7946238", "7905259", "8098203", "8489325", "8161287", "1393335", "1627044", "1590179", "1411327", "2391196", "2367608", "2346833", "2487181", "3167396", "3064280", "3495958", "2875663", "2870753", "7165478", "6275811", "7134891", "7458574", "678037", "4917967", "5352849", "5902667", "13042668"], "inbound_citations": ["37254157", "37159365", "37201154", "37121252", "37004331", "37223185", "37047464", "36896797", "36806586", "36707524", "36706475", "37293141", "36646973", "36639353", "36895432", "36682995", "36652842", "36495858", "36463972", "36462293", "36396933", "36363541", "36302861", "36196584", "36206591", "36222818", "36155307", "36029656", "36032231", "35904721", "35855645", "35672956", "35652327", "35639493", "35573364", "35451023", "35404256", "35353882", "35253056", "35235256", "35247794", "35261544", "35078954", "35228035", "35041015", "35389361", "34838528", "34103242", "36042158", "36420692", "35238510", "35238506", "34961376", "34933680", "34934318", "34886117", "34869192", "34792401", "34791283", "34808495", "34764891", "34670760", "34596461", "34639510", "34570061", "34658635", "34557119", "34575005", "34390232", "34381387", "34263540", "34456031", "34165398", "34120548", "34023019", "34046312", "33982800", "33938426", "34009370", "33840396", "33862018", "36267476", "33754644", "33715640", "33626593", "33589216", "33555616", "33564227", "33507838", "33507831", "33845902", "33445224", "33441112", "33417996", "33507525", "33438863", "33407986", "33067054", "34107886", "34934318", "33356744", "33369162", "33263822", "33279373", "33165624", "33210009", "33058260", "33162877", "33020032", "33149559", "33029344", "33061925", "32883397", "32982245", "32870161", "32868793", "32892002", "32840872", "32784347", "32788150", "32828348", "32750572", "32832130", "32701903", "32701904", "32594935", "32597274", "32763534", "32841653", "32603929", "32524757", "32513876", "32469448", "32405798", "32345391", "32182388", "32134336", "32141908", "32115314", "32062728", "32093460", "32051177", "31956334", "31866076", "31806527", "31767510", "30968810", "32303028", "31969843", "31875333", "31829775", "31826793", "31542210", "31741178", "31730504", "32310935", "31591400", "31503175", "30821079", "31821154", "31651400", "31393186", "31460865", "31308636", "31241396", "31354275", "31190660", "30552914", "31158114", "31059621", "31026764", "29052964", "31050757", "31007894", "30712261", "30886581", "30540617", "30905129", "30924789", "30735922", "30557808", "30561238", "30603806", "29909790", "31158118", "31370036", "30559688", "28402046", "28418116", "30485671", "28594264", "30322823", "30375301", "30349961", "30323274", "30302053", "27734591", "30377146", "27601077", "29571751", "29883861", "30121902", "30094584", "30079763", "29606551", "27726284", "29985680", "29161951", "29988997", "29927087", "29909790", "30344998", "29888512", "29882073", "29864752", "29855992", "29764266", "29767567", "29406406", "29702756", "29868849", "29621900", "28990719", "29369974", "29606876", "29538474", "29119689", "29955546", "29527507", "27618789", "29379293", "29232310", "29164930", "28499766", "25590552", "29242310", "29196388", "26256465", "28738259", "29350127", "29192096", "29201010", "28800510", "29061407", "26818493", "26294330", "28919292", "28942410", "28934214", "28542034", "28595147", "28864750", "28953806", "28703015", "30089972", "28614404", "28597226", "28591137", "25721376", "27839914", "28490882", "25583091", "27789187", "28139249", "28484349", "28129701", "28112539", "27745754", "27264948", "28096881", "28005578", "28274026", "28374699", "27796500", "27863801", "27792977", "28009667", "27931902", "27821411", "27815602", "27807604", "27783548", "27783067", "27783129", "27770820", "27765033", "27917216", "26925705", "27658835", "27404479", "27553839", "27534796", "27563237", "25962446", "27132495", "26974214", "26597275", "27482242", "27376266", "29067299", "27042990", "27151070", "27144681", "26987938", "27106681", "27086207", "27052109", "26567932", "27069340", "27065889", "27803718", "26890690", "27183509", "26864352", "26636244", "26541453", "26678982", "26792993", "26725294", "26260361", "26176646", "26598473", "26516984", "26343461", "26196188", "26388066", "26072427", "26417794", "26234190", "29379761", "26099660", "26293744", "26346330", "26243839", "25711509", "26193256", "26062967", "25957394", "26056450", "25934131", "26508952", "25448776", "25394750", "23968457", "26884789", "25821065", "25547440", "25750247", "25592805", "25886679", "25040487", "25686801"], "label": "0"}

In humans, there are 5 isoenzymes involved in this process. The activity of these enzymes can be modulated by a number of commonly used drugs, yielding potentially hazardous interactions. Most of the recently introduced selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Thus, the plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants or clozapine might be elevated into toxic levels. In contrast, carbamazepine induces most of the isoenzymes. This potentiates the elimination of tricyclics and antipsychotics and might cause a serious risk for the recurrence of depressive or psychotic symptoms. Moreover, 5-10% of the population are slow metabolizers of CYP2D6. This group is prone to increased adverse effects of moderately dosed medication. This review systematically points out the reported or predicted pharmacokinetic drug interactions in psychopharmacology focussing on clinical significance.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Anesthesia was standardized. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group I (T) patients received tramadol 75 mg, Group II (TD) patients received tramadol 75 mg plus droperidol 2.5 mg, and Group III (TC) patients received tramadol 75 mg plus clonidine 150 microg in a total volume of 10 mL administered as a single epidural injection in the postanesthesia care unit. The onset time of analgesia and duration of analgesia, visual analogue pain scores, sedation, nausea scores, vital signs and side effects were recorded. Duration of analgesia was similar in both the TD and TC groups, and significantly longer than in the T group (P < 0.001). Group TC patients displayed a significant increase in sedation scores and decrease in blood pressure and heart rate when compared with other groups (P < 0.001). No adverse effects were observed in Group TD, while nausea scores were high in both the T and TC groups (P < 0.001). Pain score, respiration rate, and SpO(2) values were similar in all study groups.

This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of bupropion SR and sertraline.\n\n\nMETHOD\nOutpatients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder (DSM-IV) received bupropion SR (100-300 mg/day) or sertraline (50-200 mg/day) for 16 weeks. Psychiatric evaluations, including the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the Clinical Global Impressions scale for Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and for Improvement (CGI-I) were completed, and adverse events were assessed in the clinic periodically throughout treatment. Patients' orgasm function was also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean HAM-D, HAM-A, CGI-I, and CGI-S scores improved over the course of treatment in both the bupropion SR group and the sertraline group; no between-group differences were observed on any of the scales. Orgasm dysfunction was significantly (p < .001) more common in sertraline-treated patients compared with bupropion SR-treated patients.

The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic effects of intrathecal and IV clonidine with acute noxious stimulation and with hyperalgesia from intradermal capsaicin injection in volunteers. Sixteen healthy volunteers received intradermal injections of capsaicin (100 [micro sign]g) before and after the IV or intrathecal injection of clonidine 50 or 150 [micro sign]g in a randomized, double-blind manner. Pain and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were determined at specified intervals. In addition, pain to noxious heat stimulation was determined. The capsaicin injection produced pain, followed by hyperalgesia and allodynia. The intrathecal, but not IV, injection of 150 [micro sign]g of clonidine reduced capsaicin-induced pain and area of hyperalgesia. Intrathecal clonidine (150 [micro sign]g) reduced pain to heat stimulation, whereas IV clonidine did not. The groups did not differ in hemodynamic or sedative effects from clonidine. These data support the value of intraspinal administration of clonidine for the treatment of acute pain and of pain states associated with hyperalgesia. Similarly, they suggest that analgesia from the systemic administration of this [alpha]2-adrenergic agonist, if any, is weak in doses that produce sedation and reduce blood pressure. Implications: To the extent that the experimental pain conditions used in this study reflect those in patients with acute and chronic pain, these data support the spinal rather than IV injection of clonidine for analgesia.

The study design included a baseline phase and two double-blind phases in which patients were randomly assigned to medication under two different dose conditions (fixed dose and flexible dose). Secondary memory was assessed at baseline, fixed-dose, and flexible-dose phases, using the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Six measures were selected, which formed three factors (general verbal learning ability, retention, and learning strategy). Risperidone-treated patients showed greater improvement than haloperidol-treated patients in general verbal learning ability, a finding characterized by significant treatment effects on CVLT measures of learning acquisition, recall consistency, and recognition memory. After controlling for benztropine status, differences on the measures of learning acquisition and recall consistency remained significant, and differences in recognition memory weakened slightly (p = 0.07).

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of the English-language literature and fan searches of papers evaluating oral antihypertensives in HUs and emergencies were conducted. STUDY SELECTION: Controlled and uncontrolled studies in humans are reviewed. Emphasis was placed on recent trials evaluating individual agents and comparative trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Comparative trials have demonstrated that four currently available oral agents can lower blood pressure rapidly and predictably. Nifedipine, the most extensively studied, and clonidine have served traditionally as the oral agents of choice for the treatment of HUs. All the agents can lower blood pressure effectively within the first few hours after dosing, but their use also has been associated with adverse effects. Nifedipine and captopril are the two agents with the most rapid onset, within 0.5\u20131 hour, and may treat hypertensive emergencies as well as urgencies. Clonidine and labetalol have maximal blood pressure lowering effects at 2\u20134 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Captopril, clonidine, labetalol, and nifedipine are all effective agents for the treatment of HUs. Agent selection should be based on the perceived need for urgent blood pressure control, the cause of HU, and concomitant conditions. A definite benefit from acute blood pressure lowering in HUs has yet to be demonstrated, especially in asymptomatic patients. More controlled trials with less aggressive dosing regimens and placebo controls need to be performed to assess the most appropriate treatments for HUs with the fewest adverse effects.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35847224", "25193736"], "label": "0"}

Information related to clozapine eligibility was abstracted by trained non-clinical personnel. The impact of subgroup membership on eligibility was examined using logistic regression procedures. 3. Even under the broadest interpretation of FDA requirements for clozapine use, Asian patients were less likely to be eligible, since fewer Asian patients met clozapine treatment requirements. Under more stringent eligibility criteria, older patients were more likely to be excluded from eligibility when TD does not automatically satisfy treatment criteria, and younger patients were more likely to lose eligibility if the number of required adequate medication trials increases to three. 4. Broad eligibility criteria tend to differentially exclude Asian patients while more stringent criteria differentially exclude younger and older patients.", "outbound_citations": ["8685657", "7653684", "7583481", "8375833", "1390401", "1918557", "2401480", "2179100", "2572373", "2782476", "2732058", "3046553", "7377387", "889163", "978187"], "inbound_citations": ["36979877", "31291629", "29713292", "28647739", "27264948", "27931902", "25863824"], "label": "0"}

Fourty-four medication-free subjects (41 boys and three girls; mean age of 10.4 years) with ADHD, combined type, and a tic disorder participated. After 8 weeks of treatment, lofexidine was associated with a mean improvement of 41% in the total score on the teacher-rated ADHD Rating Scale compared to 7% improvement for placebo. Eleven of 22 subjects who received lofexidine were blindly rated on the Clinical Global Scale-Improvement as either much improved or very much improved compared to none of 22 subjects who received placebo. The mean score on the parent-rated hyperactivity index improved by 29% in the lofexidine group and 18% in the placebo group, which was not a significant difference. On the Continuous Performance Test, commission errors decreased by 25% and omission errors by 20% in the lofexidine group, compared with increases of 33% in commission errors and of 36% in omission errors in the placebo group. Tic severity decreased by 27% in the lofexidine group, compared to 0% in the placebo group. One lofexidine subject with sedation withdrew at week 4.

For the seven studies that compared clozapine to a typical antipsychotic, a meta-analysis was performed to examine clozapine's effects on overall psychopathology, response rate, extrapyramidal symptoms, and tardive dyskinesia.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe meta-analysis confirmed that treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients have more favorable outcomes when treated with clozapine rather than a typical antipsychotic, as reflected by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score, categorical response rate, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms score, Simpson-Angus Rating Scale score, and compliance rate. Clozapine also conferred benefits on the sickest treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients. Patients treated with olanzapine also had more favorable outcomes with regard to categorical response and compliance rates.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the aggregate, the results of a meta-analysis indicated that clozapine exhibits superiority over typical antipsychotics in terms of both efficacy (as measured by improvement in overall psychopathology) and safety (in terms of reduced extrapyramidal side effects). However, the magnitude of the clozapine treatment effect was not consistently robust. Efficacy data for other second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment of patients with refractory schizophrenia were inconclusive.

There are several investigations in the adult literature which have employed the use of psychostimulants in treating both psychiatric and neuropsychological residua associated with head injury.

The present prospective investigation utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over experimental design to examine the efficacy of methylphenidate in treating children with acquired attentional disorders secondary to brain injury. A cohort of 14 children with varying degrees of head injury were recruited for participation. As expected, differences between drug and placebo conditions uniformly achieved statistical significance. Additionally, there were no differences in performance between baseline and placebo conditions on neurobehavioral tasks of attention and concentration.

Eighty-five patients with severe cancer pain despite large doses of opioids or with therapy-limiting side effects from opioids were randomized to receive, in a double-blind manner, 30 micrograms/h epidural clonidine or placebo for 14 days, together with rescue epidural morphine. Pain was assessed by visual analog score (VAS), McGill Pain Questionnaire, and daily epidural morphine use. Success was defined as a decrease in either morphine use of VAS pain, with the alternative variable either decreasing or remaining constant. Blood pressure, heart rate, and degree of nausea and sedation were monitored. Successful analgesia was more common with epidural clonidine (45%) than with placebo (21%). This was particularly prominent in those with neuropathic pain (56% vs. 5%). Pain scores were lower at the end of the treatment period in patients with neuropathic pain treated with clonidine rather than placebo, whereas morphine use was unaffected. Clonidine, but not placebo, decreased blood pressure and heart rate. Hypotension was considered a serious complication in 2 patients receiving clonidine and in 1 patient receiving placebo.

Significant decreases in systolic blood pressure (<\u200390\u2003mmHg) were observed in all patients premedicated with 300\u2003\u03bcg clonidine. Throughout the study nine patients (75%) in the 300\u2003\u03bcg clonidine group were treated at least once for hypotension.

Subjects with schizophrenia who were being treated in community settings at 3 collaborating clinical facilities were enrolled.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects treated with haloperidol were significantly more likely to discontinue treatment for lack of efficacy (51%) than were those treated with clozapine (12%). A higher proportion of clozapine-treated subjects met an a priori criterion of improvement (57%) compared with haloperidol-treated subjects (25%). Significantly greater improvement was seen in symptoms of psychosis, hostile-suspiciousness, anxiety-depression, thought disturbance, and total score measured on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. No differences were detected in negative symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale or the Schedule for Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Subjects treated with clozapine experienced more excess salivation, dizziness, and sweating and less dry mouth and decreased appetite than those treated with haloperidol.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCompared with a first-generation antipsychotic given in a moderate dose, clozapine offers substantial clinical benefits to treatment-refractory subjects who can be treated in the community.

Prior to the publication of DSM-III in 1980, excessive tobacco use had not been considered as a psychiatric problem requiring treatment [1]. Smoking has been recognized as a serious medical problem since thefirst Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health in 1964. An important development during the 10 to 20 years following this report was the growth of knowledge regarding the physiological effects of regular tobacco use and the importance of nicotine as the main pharmacological ingredient in tobacco. This body of information culminated in the 1988 Surgeon General's Report, which recognized chronic tobacco use as a form of addictive behavior [2]. Nicotine, like other drugs of abuse, has reinforcing psychoactive effects that lead to its repeated self-administration. Nicotine stimulates the release of several neurotransmitters including dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and endorphins [3]. Through its effects on the dopaminergic, or 'reward', system, nicotine exerts psychoactive effects such as an increased sense of enjoyment. The norepinephrinergic effects of nicotine may account for increased attentiveness and improved performance in repetitive tasks, while its anxiolytic effects are likely mediated through GABA and the endorphins.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34355745", "33212796", "33004310", "31112733", "30529105"], "label": "0"}

In contrast to the older conventional antipsychotic agents, atypical medications have a broader spectrum of efficacy (greater efficacy in negative, cognitive, and mood symptoms) and a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia. Due to concerns surrounding hematological safety and other adverse effects, clozapine is used principally in patients refractory to treatment with other antipsychotic agents. The other three universally available atypical agents (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) collectively constitute about 70% of all antipsychotic prescriptions in the USA. Despite the broad popularity of these medications and their rapid adoption in general clinical practice, there are limited data on how they compare to each other with regards to their overall efficacy and also as to their efficacy in specific symptom domains. To address this question, two separate analyses were undertaken. First, all published, short-term, randomized, controlled clinical trials of these agents in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were reviewed and the extent of improvement across these agents was compared. While the amount of improvement with a particular agent across its different studies varied, the average improvement was similar for the agents for all efficacy parameters considered. Secondly, all randomized, controlled clinical trials directly comparing two or more of these agents in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were analyzed. Only three such trials (all industry sponsored) were identified; while there were differences in methodology and small differences in efficacy on a minority of measures on which comparisons were undertaken, the preponderance of data suggested no differences in efficacy.

An ESRS factor analysis and maximum changes in ESRS scores were compared for the risperidone, haloperidol, and placebo groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe factor analysis revealed five factors. Between-group comparisons showed no differences between placebo and 1 to 2 mg/day-risperidone groups. Parkinsonism, tremor, akathisia, and sialorrhea were more likely to occur with haloperidol than with placebo or risperidone at 1 to 6 mg/day. Similar results were noted by maximum changes in ESRS scores. At risperidone doses of more than 8 mg/day, acute EPS severity lay between that of the placebo and haloperidol groups. The severity of tardive dyskinesia was greater in patients receiving placebo than in those receiving either active treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs the results described above were derived from a post hoc analysis of an existing database, conclusions must remain tentative. To provide more definitive answers, EPS assessments in future studies should be refined to more accurately predict the type of EPS expected with a given agent in clinical practice.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Subjects were randomly allocated to six weeks of olanzapine (5\u201320 mg) or haloperidol (5\u201320 mg) treatment; responders were followed for up to one year of double-blind, long-term maintenance therapy. Results Olanzapine-treated patients achieved a statistically significant greater improvement than haloperidol-treated patients on overall measures of efficacy, including clinical response. Significantly fewer olanzapine patients left the study early, and fewer adverse events were observed among those receiving olanzapine. During maintenance, olanzapine-treated patients continued to experience additional improvement, with fewer EPS but more weight gain than those on haloperidol.

Study 4 was a study of criterion validity, using an additional sample of 86 children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Nineteen neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenic patients who received clozapine were withdrawn from clozapine by tapering it over 3-week period with and without the addition of a typical neuroleptic. Fifteen of the 19 neuroleptic-responsive patients experienced the return of psychotic symptoms during or after the clozapine taper, which were most severe in the ten patients in whom the withdrawal of clozapine was carried out without prior addition of neuroleptic treatment. Addition of a neuroleptic prior to clozapine withdrawal prevented the emergence of positive symptoms during clozapine withdrawal in each of eight patients. Nevertheless, psychotic symptoms emerged, usually within a week after discontinuing clozapine, in six of the eight patients. Neuroleptic treatment, with or without an anticholingergic drug, was much less effective in treating positive symptoms in these patients immediately after the clozapine withdrawal than it had been 2 years previously. Cyproheptadine, a non-selective serotonin receptor antagonist, augmented the antipsychotic effect of neuroleptics in each of four patients who relapsed following withdrawal from clozapine and relieved extrapyramidal symptoms in a fifth patient. The frequency of relapse following withdrawal of clozapine in 64 neuroleptic-resistant patients was significantly lower (25/64, 39.1%) than in the neuroleptic-responsive patients.", "outbound_citations": ["1349752", "2117764", "1969173", "2682727", "2568659", "3124174", "3927364", "3103155", "6441952", "6433395", "8938913", "8581482", "7673658", "7872841", "7543218", "7884024", "7792331", "7961581", "7961582", "7945739", "7518338", "8267129", "8120151", "7901792", "8306925", "8102646", "8463447", "8383744", "7683702", "1637254", "1349347", "1418889", "1637936", "1357741", "1932400", "1869497", "1670979", "1904750", "1703232", "1679253", "1689375", "2525063", "22282895", "2649160", "2571912", "3046553", "3212159", "6474101", "7111598", "7246875", "6108078", "531070", "39641", "375865", "678037", "971653", "1093729", "4154763", "4154183", "4153596", "4150951", "5806858", "2879312"], "inbound_citations": ["36794520", "35512817", "34651184", "34229529", "33754644", "34552710", "31463768", "29344339", "27648956"], "label": "0"}

Quantitative evaluation of this GFJ-drug interaction is required for the proper clinical management of patients. Methods Using felodipine as a model drug, we constructed a pharmacokinetic model based on irreversible inhibition of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by GFJ. We fitted previously published data [5, 6] for felodipine ER (extended release formulation) to the ratio of CLGI,int before and after grapefruit juice ingestion by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis to estimate the reaction rate constant between GFJ and CYP3A4 (K) and the elimination rate constant of CYP3A4 (k ).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe model gave a turnover rate of CYP3A4 of 0.0849 h-1, corresponding to a half-life of 8.16 h, in agreement with reported values. The AUC-time profiles of felodipine ER in the case of different amounts and schedules of GFJ ingestion were simulated using the parameter values estimated from the model.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe modelling leads to the important conclusion that GFJ-felodipine interaction increases with increasing frequency and amount of GFJ ingestion, and that an interval of 2-3 days between GFJ intake and felodipine administration is necessary if GFJ-felodipine interaction is to be avoided.", "outbound_citations": ["10903978", "9821810", "9578182", "9548795", "9542479", "9495849", "9591935", "9400033", "9351897", "9352575", "9153299", "9174684", "8971132", "8689808", "8612381", "8631189", "8562295", "7648762", "7619215", "7628179", "7587960", "8527268", "7768070", "8275614", "12959294", "8513655", "8485024", "1914375", "1671113", "2858556", "6437340", "7328489", "4210516", "4712617", "13932730", "1577050", "PMC508096", "8751023", "PMC1365172", "PMC1365027", "PMC1364619", "9625273", "PMC1873963", "PMC1381556", "PMC1572193", "8321836"], "inbound_citations": ["34272691", "33043714", "31902916", "29068158", "27106707"], "label": "0"}

Methods Patients who were in the hospital for at least 3 months prior to receiving risperidone and subsequently received risperidone for at least 3 months formed the cohort. A mirror-image design was used with duration to a maximum of 1 year before and 1 year after initiation of risperidone. The hospital population that did not receive either risperidone or clozapine during the same time period was used for comparison of trends of seclusion and restraint. Results Seventy-four patients (most with schizophrenia) met the inclusion criteria of the risperidone group. There were statistically significant decreases in the number of seclusion hours (2.2 [SD 5.5] to 0.26 [SD 0.06]) and of events (0.23 [SD 0.59] to 0.05 [SD 0.14]) per person per month during risperidone treatment, compared with the prerisperidone treatment period (P = 0.01). The comparison group also evidenced decreases on these measures during the same time period, but the risperidone-treated cohort achieved a proportionally greater reduction. There were similar trends toward reduction in the restraint measures during risperidone treatment compared with prerisperidone, but these did not achieve statistical significance. The comparison group also showed slightly decreased use of restraints over the study period. Conclusions Risperidone appears to have had a positive impact on seclusion in this state-hospital psychiatric population. These data support the positive impact of risperidone on violence found in other studies. Violence and aggression are major factors that affect morale among psychiatric patients and staff.

Many had conditions commonly comorbid with ADHD (44%), other chronic health conditions (41%), and injuries (40%). More than half received psychotropic medication (57%); fewer received psychological services (27%). Twenty-two different psychotropic medications were used. Patterns included more than 1 psychotropic medication (46%) in 30 combinations of simultaneous use and 44 combinations of sequential use. The mean number of ambulatory visits was 18.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChildren aged 3 years or younger had ADHD diagnosed and received markedly variable psychotropic medication regimens. Little information is available to guide these practices. The presence of comorbid conditions and injuries attests to these children's vulnerability.

This study examined analgesic efficacy and side effects of epidurally administered clonidine in patients with severe, refractory RSD. MethodsTwenty-six patients with severe chronic pain consistent with RSD were studied in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled design. Cervical or lumbar epidural catheters were inserted for patients with upper or lower extremity RSD, respectively, and patients received, in random order on three consecutive days, epidural injection of clonidine, 300 or 700 \u03bcg, or placebo. Pain (by visual analog score (VAS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire), sedation, blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored at specified Intervals for 6 h after injection. Patients who responded to clonidine, but not placebo, then entered a trial of open-label, continuous epidural infusion of clonidine (10\u201350 \u03bcg/h). ResultsClonidine, but not placebo, caused pain relief, sedation, and decreased blood pressure and heart rate after bolus epidural injection. The smaller clonidine dose (300 \u03bcg), produced pain relief and decreases in blood pressure and heart rate similar to those of the 700 \u03bcg dose, but with less sedation. Epidural clonidine was infused for a mean of 43 days in 19 patients at a mean rate of 32 \u03bcg/h for sustained analgesia. ConclusionsTransdermal clonidine has been demonstrated to produce analgesia in the area surrounding its application site in patients with SMP. The current study indicates that extensive analgesia may be obtained by epidural administration. Sedation and hypotension may limit bolus epidural clonidine administration for RSD. The role for chronic epidural Infusion of clonidine has not yet been established.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36581788", "35482967", "33769405", "33537907", "31503044", "30850920", "29492826", "29054696", "28670058", "28330506", "28492436", "28523214", "27506651", "26996722", "26656611"], "label": "0"}

In the first two sessions (Experiment 1) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to tyramine hydrochloride eyedrops (75 mM; 2 x 10 microliters), and in the last two sessions (Experiment 2) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to methoxamine hydrochloride eyedrops (20 mM; 2 x 10 microliters) was examined. In both experiments subjects were allocated to drugs and sessions according to a double-blind balanced design. In both experiments, pupil diameter of both the treated and the untreated eyes was recorded in standard ambient light and in the dark, before, and 2 h after clonidine/placebo, via binocular infrared television pupillometry. Salivation (dental roll technique), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sitting), heart rate, and self-ratings of mood and feelings (visual analogue scales), were also measured before, and 2 h after the ingestion of clonidine or placebo. 3. Both tyramine and methoxamine produced a significant mydriasis, which was more prominent in the light condition (change in resting pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: tyramine/light 1.05 +/- 0.28; tyramine/dark: 0.73 +/- 0.15; methoxamine/light: 1.65 +/- 0.28; methoxamine/dark: 0.85 +/- 0.15). Clonidine produced a significant miosis in the untreated eye which was more prominent in the light condition (change in resting pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: Experiment 1, light: -1.34 +/- 0.19; Experiment 1, dark: -0.46 +/- 0.1; Experiment 2, light -0.97 +/- 0.18; Experiment 2, dark: -0.29 +/- 0.17). Clonidine had no significant effect on either tyramine- or methoxamine-evoked mydriasis. 4. In agreement with previous reports, clonidine significantly reduced salivation (g, mean +/- s.e.mean; Experiment 1: -0.84 +/- 0.22; Experiment 2: -0.55 +/- 0.11), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 1: -17.5 +/- 3.76; Experiment 2: -23.38 +/- 4.67), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 2: -12.38 +/- 2.05), alertness (mm; Experiment 2: -24.19 +/- 5.40), and anxiety (mm; Experiment 1: -13.82 +/- 4.60), indicating the presence of pharmacodynamically effective tissue levels of the drug. 5. These results show that a single oral dose (200 micrograms) of clonidine causes significant miosis in human subjects, and fails to potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis. This indicates that the pupil on the asymptomatic side of cluster headache patients is affected differently from the pupils of healthy volunteers by tyramine and/or clonidine.", "outbound_citations": ["2015177", "2368824", "2804539", "3242574", "22156073", "4005103", "6725854", "6897524", "7295459", "759408", "5571230", "5093959", "4899510", "14431290"], "inbound_citations": ["33751656", "30714782", "30619035"], "label": "0"}

Depressed patients with psychotic disorders frequently require treatment with concomitant antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. Imipramine pharmacokinetics serve as a marker for hepatic CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A activity. An open\u2010label, three\u2010way randomized crossover study was done to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and potential for a drug interaction between olanzapine (5 mg) and imipramine (75 mg). Each drug was administered alone and in combination. Nine healthy men, ages 32 to 54 years, enrolled in the study. Psychomotor performance capacities, plasma olanzapine, imipramine, desipramine concentrations, and clinical laboratory tests were measured. Pharmacokinetic variables, vital signs, subjective tests for liveliness, and psychomotor outcomes were analyzed using a two\u2010way ANOVA. Olanzapine was safe. Sedation, postural hypotension, and minor vital sign alterations occurred during all treatments. On the liveliness questionnaire, patients generally reported poorer (less lively) scores with olanzapine alone or coadministered with imipramine versus baseline scores. These effects disappeared within 24 hours after administration. Olanzapine alone and in combination decreased motor\u2010speed tasks (finger tapping and visual\u2010arm random reach) compared with baseline or imipramine treatment. Peak 6\u2010hour changes were statistically significant but clinical importance was only marginal. Olanzapine concentrations were <19% greater than with imipramine.

However, the levels of dopamine transporter blockade achieved by therapeutic doses of methylphenidate are not known. This study measured, for the first time, dopamine transporter occupancy by orally administered methylphenidate in the human brain and its rate of uptake in the brain.\n\n\nMETHOD\nPositron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]cocaine were used to estimate dopamine transporter occupancies after different doses of oral methylphenidate in seven normal subjects (mean age=24 years, SD=7). In addition, the pharmacokinetics of oral methylphenidate were measured in the baboon brain through use of PET and [11C]methylphenidate administered through an orogastric tube.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 120 minutes after administration, oral methylphenidate produced a dose-dependent blockade of dopamine transporter; means=12% (SD= 4%) for 5 mg, 40% (SD=12%) for 10 mg, 54% (SD=5%) for 20 mg, 72% (SD=3%) for 40 mg, and 74% (SD=2%) for 60 mg. The estimated dose of oral methylphenidate required to block 50% of the dopamine transporter corresponded to 0.25 mg/kg. Oral methylphenidate did not reach peak concentration in brain until 60 minutes after its administration.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOral methylphenidate is very effective in blocking dopamine transporters, and at the weight-adjusted doses used therapeutically (0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg), it is likely to occupy more than 50% of the dopamine transporters. The time to reach peak brain uptake for oral methylphenidate in brain corresponds well with the reported time course to reach peak behavioral effects.", "outbound_citations": ["9126740", "8885584", "8816810", "8822535", "7666894", "8547887", "7790958", "7771915", "7929663", "7839313", "11224277", "1424430", "1357114", "1501682", "1871323", "1786488", "1849397", "2384545", "2529365", "2557686", "2903550", "2820058", "4031878", "6410043", "7116761", "7079034", "1142112", "4473537", "4197505"], "inbound_citations": ["37108960", "36993597", "36930337", "36765261", "36572273", "36226261", "36037842", "35892406", "35923915", "35835210", "35886894", "36100228", "35711596", "35357236", "34798853", "35670369", "34707237", "34702857", "34613513", "34548499", "34385608", "34404915", "33941809", "33858320", "33201262", "33186568", "33154714", "33007778", "32919398", "32776103", "32726658", "32594941", "32590405", "32600667", "32454161", "32461027", "32307560", "32171819", "32473593", "32794142", "32193325", "31506011", "31670905", "31581854", "31358436", "31473806", "30950912", "31358792", "31032750", "31054043", "29244542", "30810347", "30913975", "30899317", "30847388", "30407135", "30423424", "30119076", "30060068", "30001426", "29717334", "29574296", "29172028", "29700388", "29428394", "29547978", "29559423", "27648848", "27937142", "29206921", "28816243", "28946787", "28299946", "29317696", "29131668", "29116873", "29129558", "28690202", "28965364", "28750831", "29112197", "28748860", "28604926", "28438467", "28450072", "28893054", "28643800", "28633952", "28725548", "28507595", "28179105", "28421257", "28268188", "28325648", "27676634", "28116523", "28056655", "28165318", "28691722", "27623091", "27402599", "27789952", "27694879", "27329555", "27622596", "27156854", "27318633", "27027427", "27454675", "26821979", "27409720", "27084305", "27287610", "26711850", "27085500", "26829074", "27145395", "26691428", "26635194", "27244237", "27148006", "26970351", "26880226", "26608122", "28123829", "25968325"], "label": "0"}

Thus, serotonin-2A overactivity may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and serotonin-2A antagonism may contribute to therapeutic effects of antipsychotics.", "outbound_citations": ["9376449", "8819525", "1449384", "1679253", "2843634", "6133348", "1207384", "5911238"], "inbound_citations": ["37231080", "37167080", "37122272", "37045591", "37138774", "36938991", "37161078", "36932180", "37082754", "37149346", "36980303", "36921889", "36889432", "36896410", "36874002", "36633720", "36630260", "36681076", "36646257", "36474478", "36266118", "36913839", "36844032", "36620862", "36527355", "36477925", "36373934", "36340802", "36327017", "36407948", "36358968", "36280799", "36280752", "36278982", "36263882", "36224112", "36275302", "36241352", "36180111", "36173202", "36113878", "36097251", "36259015", "36049313", "36031848", "36001433", "35963018", "35900876", "35894503", "35882885", "36430623", "35811423", "35788817", "35878791", "35841696", "35638159", "35631466", "35530025", "35388724", "35411074", "35381208", "35348806", "36630309", "35301934", "35301459", "35285721", "35274296", "35360137", "35253070", "35792293", "35233648", "35225143", "35217796", "35197453", "35149998", "35225956", "36108798", "34794703", "35079988", "35060714", "35022823", "35000572", "35936944", "35090363", "35077687", "36786290", "35588933", "35217108", "35483649", "35222010", "34958455", "34975593", "34912222", "34959614", "34816433", "36218281", "34797943", "34741320", "34729786", "34715446", "34712118", "34671279", "34686347", "34730895", "34681209", "34545195", "34616730", "34537829", "34603053", "34345931", "34288515", "35294242", "34255821", "34224112", "34671731", "34115036", "34090893", "34043427", "34038314", "34048997", "34063505", "33850049", "33849370", "33860172", "33807281", "33663259", "33716753", "34348413", "34228959", "33672330", "34189985", "33479368", "33472250", "33420592", "33860183", "33861218", "33861219", "33288378", "33069863", "31182391", "34115036", "33785130", "33541682", "33541675", "33328244", "33485158", "33285579", "33291798", "33280274", "33174492", "33143790", "33501857", "33021086", "32980479", "32960851", "32954860", "32944778", "32929261", "32906643", "32843702", "32811586", "32922734", "32627308", "32547435", "32454209", "32433580", "32449404", "32296353", "32212672", "32205338", "32146028", "32150976", "32115745", "32174803", "32044687", "31954738", "31917152", "31756337", "31500679", "32038315", "31915427", "31826670", "31849671", "31649304", "31132450", "31500679", "30965131", "31063768", "31303095", "31221820", "31636488", "30981875", "31106729", "30698994", "30776375", "30633430", "30521880", "30845376", "30986058", "30939118", "31027219", "30917304", "30967099", "30821651", "29785763", "30816797", "30807107", "30789291", "30053461", "30385253", "30685771", "30394903", "30467466", "29753748", "30288594", "30254752", "30209534", "30245648", "30062577", "30422079", "30102081", "29956917", "29950360", "29954475", "29807492", "29740267", "29560311", "29568270", "29545753", "28585392", "29403350", "29225192", "29284138", "29221792", "29101022", "28755886", "28025814", "27900674", "28677096", "29532180", "30471683", "28512684", "28831734", "28224459", "29302713", "29220382", "29143869", "29119217", "29167644", "28967351", "28625125", "28940312", "28858536", "28868040", "28783139", "29247209", "27834144", "28637246", "28588463", "28176400", "28447622", "28443617", "28386699", "27013076", "28375205", "28353056", "28244748", "26349010", "28540034", "28222297", "27684102", "27903793", "28097528", "27766370", "27810345", "27909163", "27856683", "27886063", "27734956", "27649637", "27470427", "27568266", "27568265", "27381086", "27454674", "27157251", "27216487", "27039035", "27084302", "27287824", "27132157", "27249781", "27226342", "26875114", "26841800", "27354909", "26874330", "26847689", "26327309", "26477571", "25784600", "26390828"], "label": "0"}

Open-label randomized trial, with 1 year of follow-up. A large health system (Group Health Cooperative) based in Seattle. Adult smokers (N = 1524) interested in quitting smoking. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 combinations of bupropion SR (150 or 300 mg) and behavioral counseling (minimal or moderate intensity). The primary outcome measure was self-reported point-prevalence 7-day nonsmoking status at 3 and 12 months following the target quit date. Secondary outcomes included adverse and abstinence effects reported since beginning treatment with bupropion SR. At 3 months, a significantly higher rate of nonsmoking was observed among those receiving the larger bupropion SR dose (P=.005). At 12 months, moderate intensity counseling was associated significantly with a higher rate of nonsmoking (P=.001). At 3 months, the higher dose was associated with a significantly increased frequency of self-reported symptoms such as difficulty sleeping (P=.02), difficulty concentrating (P=.02), shakiness/tremor (P=.002), and gastrointestinal problems (P=.005)and a decreased frequency of reported desire to smoke (P=.001). In this actual practice setting, the combination of bupropion SR and minimal or moderate counseling was associated with 1-year quit rates of 23.6% to 33.2%. This suggests that existing health care systems can substantially decrease tobacco use rates among their enrollees if they provide these modest interventions.", "outbound_citations": ["12689804", "12028847", "11482996", "11406741", "11377644", "11394732", "11018574", "11928522", "10728115", "10440628", "9892454", "9566937", "9554323", "9139558", "9337378", "7897458", "8017530", "8310871", "1539088", "1932883", "2071729", "4808738"], "inbound_citations": ["33234858", "29287665"], "label": "0"}

Seventy-five percent of the participants completed the trial, with no between-treatment differences in the proportion of dropouts. Similar proportions of the risperidone and olanzapine groups reported extrapyramidal symptoms (24% and 20%, respectively). Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was low in both groups, with no between-group differences. Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores and scores on the five Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factors were improved in both groups at week 8 (subjects who completed the study) and endpoint (all subjects, including dropouts). There were overall between-treatment differences in efficacy. Comparison of individual factors found no significant differences at endpoint; at week 8, however, improvements on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factors for positive symptoms and anxiety/depression were greater with risperidone than olanzapine. An increase in body weight of > or =7% was seen in 27% of olanzapine participants and 12% of risperidone participants.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBoth treatments were well tolerated and efficacious. The frequency and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms were similar in the two treatment groups. Greater reductions in severity of positive and affective symptoms were seen with risperidone than with olanzapine treatment among study completers.

This report describes the first controlled study of risperidone addition in patients with OCD refractory to treatment with SRI alone.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeventy adult patients with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD received 12 weeks of treatment with an SRI. Thirty-six patients were refractory to the SRI and were randomized in a double-blind manner to 6 weeks of risperidone (n = 20) or placebo (n = 16) addition. Behavioral ratings, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, were obtained at baseline and throughout the trial. Placebo-treated patients subsequently received an identical open-label trial of risperidone addition.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor study completers, 9 (50%) of 18 risperidone-treated patients were responders (mean daily dose, 2.2 +/-0.7 mg/d) compared with 0 of 15 in the placebo addition group (P<. 005). Seven (50%) of 14 patients who received open-label risperidone addition responded. Risperidone addition was superior to placebo in reducing OCD (P<.001), depressive (P<.001), and anxiety (P =.003) symptoms. There was no difference in response between OCD patients with and without comorbid diagnoses of chronic tic disorder or schizotypal personalty disorder.

Outcome measures for ADHD included Parent and Teacher Child Behavior Checklists (CBCL), continuous performance tests, and neuropsychologic tests of executive function. Several markers for ADHD were shown to improve significantly (P < .05) after treatment with desipramine (parent linear analogue rating, parent CBCL \"hyperactivity\" subscale, and teacher CBCL subscales \"nervous/overactive,\" \"anxious,\" and \"unpopular\"). Improvement with desipramine was always superior to that noted with clonidine. Clinical improvement did not correlate with drug blood levels. On measures of tic severity, neither drug made tics worse. Desipramine showed a statistically significant improvement on a global linear analogue scale, but not on the Hopkins Motor/Vocal Tic Severity Scale, the Tourette Syndrome Severity Scale, or the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. Clonidine did not significantly alter tic severity on any measure.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of this study suggest that desipramine may be a useful alternative for the treatment of symptoms of ADHD in children with TS.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35697396", "34286606", "32286097", "31795779", "31356288", "31295410", "31061209", "30977108", "31731911", "30501439", "29944175", "29963275", "29698507", "27132945", "26786936", "26428309", "26022170"], "label": "1"}

Clinical trials were identified by electronic searches, handsearches and contact with principal investigators. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, for outcomes related to improvement, deterioration, side-effects and drop out rates. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenzel Odds Ratio (fixed effect model). For treatments that had significant effects, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. From 296 controlled clinical trials, data were extracted from 47 trials. For most interventions, we could identify no RCT-derived evidence of efficacy. A meta-analysis showed that baclofen, deanol and diazepam were no more effective than a placebo. Single RCTs demonstrated a lack of evidence of any effect for bromocriptine, ceruletide, clonidine, estrogen, gamma linolenic acid, hydergine, lecithin, lithium, progabide, seligiline and tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol. The meta-analysis found that five interventions were effective: L-dopa, oxypertine, sodium valproate, tiapride and vitamin E; neuroleptic reduction was marginally significant. Data from single RCTs revealed that insulin, alpha methyl dopa and reserpine were more effective than a placebo. There was a significantly increased risk of adverse events associated with baclofen, deanol, L-dopa, oxypertine and reserpine. Meta-analysis of the impact of placebo (n=485) showed that 37.3% of participants showed an improvement. Interpretation of this systematic review requires caution as the individual trials identified tended to have small sample sizes. For many compounds, data from only one trial were available, and where meta-analyses were possible, these were based on a small number of trials. Despite these concerns, the review facilitated the interpretation of the large and diverse range of treatments used for TD.

Interactions can be pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic in nature. This paper focuses on the metabolic kinetic interactions between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other central nervous system (CNS) drugs. The evidence for and clinical significance of these interactions are reviewed, with special emphasis on antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Many psychotropic medications have an affinity for the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes which promote elimination by transforming lipid soluble substances into more polar compounds. SSRIs serve both as substrates and inhibitors of these enzymes. In vitro studies provide a screening method for evaluating drug affinities for substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP enzymes. Although in vitro data are important as a starting point for predicting these metabolic kinetic drug interactions, case reports and controlled experimental studies in humans are required to fully evaluate their clinical significance. Several factors must be considered when evaluating the clinical significance of a potential interaction including: (a) the nature of each drugs' activity at an enzyme site (substrate, inhibitor or inducer); (b) the potency estimations for the inhibitor/inducer; (c) the concentration of the inhibitor/inducer at the enzyme site; (d) the saturability of the enzyme; (e) the extent of metabolism of the substrate through this enzyme (versus alternative metabolic routes); (f) the presence of active metabolites of the substrate; (g) the therapeutic window of the substrate; (h) the inherent enzyme activity of the individual, phenotyping/genotyping information; (i) the level of risk of the individual experiencing adverse effects (e.g. the elderly) and (j) from an epidemiological perspective, the probability of concurrent use. This paper systematically reviews both the in vitro and in vivo evidence for drug interactions between SSRIs and other CNS drugs. As potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, both paroxetine and fluoxetine have the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of antipsychotic medications metabolised through this enzyme, including perphenazine, haloperidol, thioridazine and risperidone in patients who are CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers. Controlled studies have demonstrated this for perphenazine with paroxetine and haloperidol with fluoxetine. Fluvoxamine, as a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, can inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, resulting in higher plasma concentrations. Drug interactions between the SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can occur. Fluoxetine and paroxetine, as potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, can increase the plasma concentrations of secondary and tertiary tricyclic antidepressants. Sertraline and citalopram are less likely to have this effect. Fluvoxamine can increase the plasma concentrations of tertiary TCAs. Fluvoxamine inhibits, via CYP3A. CYP2C19 and CYP1A2, the metabolism of several benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, bromazepam and diazepam. Fluoxetine increases the plasma concentrations of alprazolam and diazepam by inhibiting CYP3A and CYP2C19, respectively. The clinical importance of the interaction with diazepam is attenuated by the presence of its active metabolite. Sertraline inhibits these enzymes only mildely to moderately at usual therapeutic doses. Therefore the potential for interactions is less; however, the in vivo evidence is minimal. Paroxetine and citalopram are unlikely to cause interactions with benzodiazepines. The evidence is conflicting for an interaction between carbamazepine and the SSRIs fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. These combinations should be used cautiously, and be accompanied by monitoring for adverse events and carb", "outbound_citations": ["9333110", "9284850", "9241008", "9084960", "9027670", "9068931", "9068935", "8819499", "8835701", "8784649", "8612387", "8610817", "8845856", "8838442", "8617707", "8617710", "8880055", "8748427", "8531073", "8564311", "8703653", "29569410", "29569409", "8567194", "7782489", "7782485", "8846620", "8846623", "7955810", "7893591", "7806690", "7974626", "7981013", "7946933", "8195463", "8194283", "8138941", "8267110", "8137598", "8148870", "8214190", "7690693", "8270593", "8415236", "8333006", "8333005", "8477556", "8466541", "8451774", "8451775", "8448065", "8225700", "1360938", "1424422", "1281075", "1389951", "1412613", "1585408", "1570226", "1544284", "1792934", "1840138", "1855347", "1888636", "1867960", "2035723", "2007317", "1711447", "1709852", "1687176", "2107764", "2307665", "2604792", "2743709", "2530759", "2530791", "3265525", "3266222", "3263100", "2902373", "3128416", "2878798", "4064464", "6303355", "630789", "1905641", "8513856", "8317590", "8407856", "3263809", "1924640", "8361990", "2784633", "7814357", "2353956", "8005185", "2784039", "8384945", "8513845", "8846617", "8379574"], "inbound_citations": ["35420565", "33970810", "32107798", "31271537", "30565342", "29975555", "27006091", "27766216", "26960809", "26216702"], "label": "0"}

The majority of in vitro, in vivo and human pharmacodynamic studies of nerve block indicate that levobupivacaine has similar potency to bupivacaine. However, levobupivacaine had a lower risk of cardiovascular and CNS toxicity than bupivacaine in animal studies. In human volunteers, levobupivacaine had less of a negative inotropic effect and, at intravenous doses >75 mg, produced less prolongation of the QTc interval than bupivacaine. Fewer changes indicative of CNS depression on EEG were evident with levobupivacaine. Levobupivacaine is long acting with a dose-dependent duration of anaesthesia. The onset of action is < or = 15 minutes with various anaesthetic techniques. In studies of surgical anaesthesia in adults, levobupivacaine provided sensory block for up to 9 hours after epidural administration of < or = 202.5 mg, 6.5 hours after intrathecal 15 mg, and 17 hours after brachial plexus block with 2 mg/kg. Randomised, double-blind clinical studies established that the anaesthetic and/or analgesic effects of levobupivacaine were largely similar to those of bupivacaine at the same dose. Sensory block tended to be longer with levobupivacaine than bupivacaine, amounting to a difference of 23 to 45 minutes with epidural administration and approximately 2 hours with peripheral nerve block. With epidural administration, levobupivacaine produced less prolonged motor block than sensory block. This differential was not seen with peripheral nerve block. Conditions satisfactory for surgery and good pain management were achieved by use of local infiltration or peribulbar administration of levobupivacaine. Levobupivacaine was generally as effective as bupivacaine for pain management during labour, and was effective for the management of postoperative pain, especially when combined with clonidine, morphine or fentanyl. The tolerability profiles of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine were very similar in clinical trials. No clinically significant ECG abnormalities or serious CNS events occurred with the doses used. The most common adverse event associated with levobupivacaine treatment was hypotension (31%). Levobupivacaine is a long acting local anaesthetic with a clinical profile closely resembling that of bupivacaine.

However, few trials directly compare novel drugs to each other. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the method of indirect meta-analysis by applying it to data on olanzapine versus haloperidol and risperidone versus haloperidol to enable a comparison between olanzapine and risperidone. Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of risperidone, olanzapine, and/or haloperidol were identified through literature searches (1983 to 1999) of the MEDLINE, Current Contents, and HealthSTAR databases and reviewed. Data for the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative subscale, the percentage of patients using anticholinergic drugs, and the percentage of patients dropping out due to lack of efficacy, side effects, or any cause were extracted and combined using the indirect method. These findings were compared with those from a direct comparative study of olanzapine and risperidone. The literature search yielded 8 RCTs comparing risperidone to haloperidol and 3 comparing olanzapine to haloperidol. Only 1 trial directly comparing olanzapine and risperidone was found. In this trial, the change in BPRS total and PANSS negative subscale scores tended to be higher with olanzapine by 1.80 and 1.10, respectively, but these differences were not statistically significant. Indirect meta-analysis yielded similar results. Changes in both BPRS total scores and PANSS negative subscale scores tended to be higher with olanzapine by 0.37 and 0.54, respectively, and again, the differences were not statistically significant. In the indirect meta-analysis, the rate of anticholinergic drug use was 19.5% greater among patients treated with risperidone than among patients treated with olanzapine (P < 0.05). In the direct comparative RCT, the rate was 13.1% higher among patients treated with risperidone (P < 0.05). The dropout rates were similar for patients treated with risperidone and those treated with olanzapine in both analyses.

Physiotherapy used to be the only way of improving motor function in such patients. However, administration of amphetamines in addition to exercise improves motor recovery in animals, probably by increasing the concentration of norepinephrine in the central nervous system. Our aim was to ascertain whether levodopa could enhance the efficacy of physiotherapy after hemiplegia. We did a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in which we enrolled 53 primary stroke patients. For the first 3 weeks patients received single doses of levodopa 100 mg or placebo daily in combination with physiotherapy. For the second 3 weeks patients had only physiotherapy. We quantitatively assessed motor function every week with Rivermead motor assessment (RMA). Six patients were excluded from analyses because of non-neurological complications. Motor recovery was significantly improved after 3 weeks of drug intervention in those on levodopa (RMA improved by 6.4 points) compared with placebo (4.1), and the result was independent of initial degree of impairment (p<0.004). The advantage of the levodopa group was maintained at study endpoint 3 weeks after levodopa was stopped. At the end of the study the total RMA score gain for the levodopa group was 8.2 points compared with 5.7 in the placebo group (p=0.020). A single dose of levodopa is well tolerated and, when given in combination with physiotherapy, enhances motor recovery in patients with hemiplegia.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a sustained-release form of bupropion for smoking cessation. We excluded smokers with current depression, but not those with a history of major depression. The 615 subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or bupropion at a dose of 100, 150, or 300 mg per day for seven weeks. The target quitting date (or \"target quit date\") was one week after the beginning of treatment. Brief counseling was provided at base line, weekly during treatment, and at 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Self-reported abstinence was confirmed by a carbon monoxide concentration in expired air of 10 ppm or less.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt the end of seven weeks of treatment, the rates of smoking cessation as confirmed by carbon monoxide measurements were 19.0 percent in the placebo group, 28.8 percent in the 100-mg group, 38.6 percent in the 150-mg group, and 44.2 percent in the 300-mg group (P<0.001). At one year the respective rates were 12.4 percent, 19.6 percent, 22.9 percent, and 23.1 percent. The rates for the 150-mg group (P=0.02) and the 300-mg group (P=0.01) -- but not the 100-mg group (P=0.09) -- were significantly better than those for the placebo group. Among the subjects who were continuously abstinent through the end of treatment, the mean absolute weight gain was inversely associated with the dose (a gain of 2.9 kg in the placebo group, 2.3 kg in 100-mg and 150-mg groups, and 1.5 kg in the 300-mg group; P= 0.02). No effects of treatment were observed on depression scores as measured serially by the Beck Depression Inventory. Thirty-seven subjects stopped treatment prematurely because of adverse events; the frequency was similar among all groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA sustained-release form of bupropion was effective for smoking cessation and was accompanied by reduced weight gain and minimal side effects.

The ensuing natural history of transitions in treatments was charted, and the outcomes including symptoms, side effects, subjective tolerability of drugs and their impact on quality of life were documented with standardized rating scales. Majority (85%) of the subjects benefited from a switch to the novel antipsychotic drugs, though some preferred to return to their original neuroleptic (8%), and others eventually required clozapine (7%) therapy. Novel antipsychotic drugs were significantly tolerated better, and had a positive impact on treatment-adherence, psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Among the novel drugs, risperidone was significantly better in improving negative symptoms, while olanzepine was particularly well tolerated and effective against comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. Patients treated with quetiapine reported fewer side effects, and showed a significantly greater improvement in neurocognitive deficits. Novel antipsychotics emerged as the drug of choice in view of their overall effectiveness, though conventional neuroleptics and clozapine will continue to have a limited but distinct role in the management of schizophrenia. The challenge for clinicians lies in matching a patient's clinical and biochemical profile with that of a drug's pharmacological actions, in order to achieve optimum outcomes.", "outbound_citations": ["11282684", "11242324", "11156796", "11099280", "11122988", "10858632", "10738844", "10674777", "11249546", "11249541", "10340685", "9988841", "8866774"], "inbound_citations": ["34626144", "31263597", "28812313", "27931893", "27199568", "26422846"], "label": "0"}

Patients were randomized to one of three groups: 1) a control group that received bupivacaine with saline for ICB and an IM injection of saline, 2) an IM group that received bupivacaine with saline for ICB and an IM injection of 2 [micro sign]g/kg clonidine, and 3) a block group that received bupivacaine with 2 [micro sign]g/kg clonidine for ICB and an IM injection of saline. Blood gases, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, and analgesic demand were determined hourly for 8 h after arrival in the postoperative care unit (PCU). Patients in the block group had significantly lower VAS scores, higher arterial oxygen tension, and lower analgesic demand for the first 4 h in the PCU, compared with the two other groups. No difference was noted thereafter. We conclude that the addition of clonidine to bupivacaine for ICB leads to a short-term effect enhancing postoperative pain control and improving arterial oxygenation, probably mediated by a direct effect on the nerves. Implications: Severe pain after thoracotomy can lead to impaired ventilation. We studied the effect of adding clonidine to bupivacaine for intercostal nerve blockade after thoracotomy. Clonidine administered directly on the nerves enhanced analgesia and improved oxygenation for a short time compared with systemic administration or control.

Moreover, risperidone was more effective than haloperidol on symptoms nonresponsive and responsive to haloperidol; its effects on negative symptoms were independent of its effects on extrapyramidal symptoms; and it was effective in treating depression in schizophrenia.

Outcome measures were the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) rating scale, and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and of Change (CGI-C) scales.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 345 patients were randomized to treatment with risperidone or placebo, and 337 patients received at least one dose of study drug.

Overall, 94% and 92% of the risperidone and placebo groups, respectively, reported at least 1 adverse event. Somnolence and urinary tract infection were more common with risperidone treatment, whereas agitation was more common with placebo.

Results: Patients taking olanzapine had a significantly increased risk of developing diabetes than non-users of antipsychotics (odds ratio 5.8, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 16.7) and those taking conventional antipsychotics (4.2, 1.5 to 12.2). Patients taking risperidone had a non-significant increased risk of developing diabetes than non-users of antipsychotics (2.2, 0.9 to 5.2) and those taking conventional antipsychotics (1.6, 0.7 to 3.8). Conclusion: Olanzapine is associated with a clinically important and significant increased risk of diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["15366975", "12019668", "11769820", "11358771", "11078035", "11013323", "10928397", "10975220", "10584769", "10553730", "10484968", "10360147", "9921705", "9798083", "9709463", "9546324", "10213569", "7872581", "8343670", "2583926", "2908235", "3052818", "6146346", "6801979", "5634402", "13408103", "10578454", "PMC31617", "PMC1463581", "PMC1678461"], "inbound_citations": ["36873213", "36507648", "36272666", "35365730", "34964866", "34526769", "34252192", "33826090", "33298416", "32393412", "32885049", "32304808", "32246399", "31862748", "30993808", "30792080", "30559230", "30295645", "29950586", "29843842", "29320364", "29122420", "29222374", "28432074", "28099349", "27979890", "27879358", "27507689", "29955467", "27256085", "28959568", "29955467", "27507689", "26308225", "26417808", "25694077", "25832638"], "label": "0"}

This 5-week, randomized, open-label study evaluated three strategies for switching patients from methylphenidate, a commonly used psychostimulant, to modafinil. Patients ( n=40) with excessive daytime sleepiness related to narcolepsy, who had received previous treatment with methylphenidate, were switched from methylphenidate to modafinil (200 mg/day followed by 400 mg/day) without a washout period between treatments, with a 2-day washout period between treatments, or by using a taper-down/titrate-up protocol. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were determined at the end of the study. The majority of patients (95%) were successfully switched to modafinil. At the study end point, mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were <12 for each treatment group. All three switching strategies were well tolerated, with adverse events mild or moderate in nature. Adverse events most frequently reported during modafinil treatment were among those seen previously in large-scale, placebo-controlled studies. There were no meaningful differences among the treatment groups in the frequency or severity of adverse events or in their relationship to modafinil treatment. Only one patient discontinued modafinil treatment because of a treatment-related adverse event (i.e. moderate headache); another patient discontinued due to insufficient efficacy. Switching from methylphenidate to modafinil was well tolerated with or without a washout period or when the methylphenidate dose is gradually tapered during initiation of modafinil therapy. Daytime wakefulness was maintained in patients who have switched from methylphenidate to modafinil.

This study compared the efficacy and safety of bupropion sustained release (SR) with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine in the treatment of major depression in elderly outpatients.\n\n\nMETHOD\nElderly (> or = 60 years) outpatients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria) were evaluated in this 6-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind study comparing bupropion SR, 100-300 mg/day, and paroxetine, 10-40 mg/day. Efficacy was assessed by changes in scores on the Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HAM-D) and Anxiety (HAM-A) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and -Improvement scales. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, and body weight.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 100 patients ranging in age from 60 to 88 years were randomly assigned to treatment with bupropion SR (N = 48) or paroxetine (N = 52). Measurements of efficacy were similar between the 2 treatment groups, with both groups showing improved scores on all depression rating scales.

Extrapyramidal symptoms (scores on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale) were more severe in the haloperidol patients than in the other two groups, but few differences were apparent between risperidone and methotrimeprazine patients.

Atomoxetine is a highly specific inhibitor of the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter with minimal affinity for other noradrenergic receptors or other neurotransmitter transporters or receptors. Results of 2 proof-of-concept studies are reported that tested the hypothesis that a selective inhibitor of presynaptic norepinephrine uptake would be effective for the treatment of ADHD in school-aged children.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTwo identical 12-week, stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in children who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. The primary efficacy outcome measure was the mean change from baseline to endpoint in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD RS) total score. Secondary efficacy measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-ADHD-Severity (CGI-ADHD-S) and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CPRS-R:S).\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 291 patients were randomized in the 2 trials combined (Study 1, N = 147; Study 2, N = 144). Stimulant-naive patients were randomized to atomoxetine, placebo, or methylphenidate. Patients with prior stimulant exposure were randomized to atomoxetine or placebo. Atomoxetine significantly reduced ADHD RS total scores compared with placebo in each study (p <.001). Changes in the CGI-ADHD-S (Study 1: p =.003; Study 2: p =.001) and CPRS-ADHD Index (Study 1: p =.023; Study 2: p <.001) also showed atomoxetine to be statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing ADHD symptoms. Atomoxetine was found to be well tolerated in this population of pediatric patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTwo studies of atomoxetine early in its development confirmed that atomoxetine, a specific and selective inhibitor of noradrenergic uptake, was effective for the treatment of children with ADHD. In addition, atomoxetine was found to be well tolerated.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36340760", "35391568", "35222104", "34355753", "28974127", "30843450", "25876607", "29580130", "29180967", "27620206", "28925314", "28498045", "28258319", "26663807", "28110366", "27738872", "27390695", "26579704", "26730199", "27290715"], "label": "1"}

Patients entered the trial when on 40 mg of methadone daily or less, and were randomised to receive incremental doses of clonidine (increasing from 0.2 mg daily to 1.2 mg daily) during a 14-day period of gradual methadone detoxification and for four weeks thereafter. Blood pressure was monitored and severity of opioid abstinence was assessed by questionnaire and by clinical examination. Result Half the subjects were withdrawn or defaulted from the trial by the end of two weeks, those receiving clonidine earlier than those receiving dummy medication (9 of the former and only one of the latter because of systemic hypotension). Similar proportions of subjects completed detoxification in the two groups.

(2) According to the studies published to date, sertindole and quetiapine are as effective as haloperidol, and risperidone and olanzapine are slightly more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of global schizophrenic symptomatology. (3) With respect to negative symptoms, all new antipsychotics are more effective than placebo. However, contrary to widespread opinion, so is the 'conventional' antipsychotic haloperidol. Risperidone and olanzapine are slightly superior, sertindole is as effective and--according to the only study fully published to date--quetiapine is even slightly less effective than haloperidol in this regard. (4) All new antipsychotics are associated with less frequent use of antiparkinson medication than haloperidol, with risperidone appearing to have a slightly less favourable EPS-profile than the other new antipsychotics.

As an example, both sedation and mental depression have been described in patients receiving centrally acting antihypertensive drugs and beta-adrenergic blockers, related to their antiadrenergic actions. In contrast, because of these antiadrenergic actions, agents like clonidine have been used to treat opiate, alcohol, and nicotine withdrawal, while beta blockers have been used to treat symptoms of performance anxiety, migraine, and psychocardiac disorders. Some antiarrhythmic drugs have been associated with delirium, and digitalis toxicity has been shown to cause hallucinations, mania, euphoria, and depression. The calcium-channel blocker verapamil has been used as an adjunctive treatment in patients with bipolar disorders.

Of these, only 10 reports provided sufficient or pertinent information for the meta-analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn all seven open studies, therapeutic responses were significant (ranging from p = .05 to .0001, two-tailed t test). Meta-analysis using weighted variables revealed a significant positive correlation (r = .88; p < .02) between duration of treatment and positive outcome. In three double-blind placebo-controlled studies, treatment effects for CBZ's superiority over placebo ranged from p = .07 to .0001. A meta-analysis of these three studies revealed that CBZ was significantly (p = .018) more effective than placebo at controlling target symptoms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite the general lack of attention that CBZ has received for treating ADHD, there is preliminary evidence that CBZ may be an effective alternate treatment in children with features of ADHD.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33276542", "28830028", "28805813", "27862608", "26674366", "26901357"], "label": "0"}

On all patients we recorded intraocular pressure (IOP), mean arterial pressure and heart rate at the following times: basal, just before EIT, immediately after EIT, 5 minutes later and 10 minutes later.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe patients pretreated with clonidine had significantly lower IOP levels than did the control group at all measurements times; patients pretreated with lidocaine had lower IOP after induction and after intubation. IOP was significantly lower in patients who received lidocaine than in control group patients after EIT, although IOP levels with lidocaine were higher than with clonidine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPretreatment with oral clonidine is an effective method for preventing increases in IOP after EIT, is more effective than pretreatment with lidocaine, and should therefore be used for that end.

Little is known about its pharmacology, including its metabolism and pharmacokinetics, in humans in controlled settings. A clinical trial was designed for the evaluation of MDMA pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 14 subjects were included. In the pilot phase six received MDMA at 50 (n=2), 100 (n=2), and 150 mg (n=2). In the second phase eight received MDMA at both 75 and 125 mg (n=8). Subjects were phenotyped for CYP2D6 activity and were classified as extensive metabolizers for substrates, such as MDMA, whose hepatic metabolism is regulated by this enzyme. Plasma and urine samples were collected throughout the study for the evaluation of MDMA pharmacokinetics. Body fluids were analysed for the determination of MDMA and its main metabolites 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-methamphetamine (HMMA) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-amphetamine (HMA).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs the dose of MDMA administered was increased, volunteers showed rises in MDMA concentrations that did not follow the same proportionality which could be indicative of nonlinearity. In the full range of doses tested the constant recovery of HMMA in the urine combined with the increasing MDMA recovery seems to point towards a saturation or an inhibition of MDMA metabolism (the demethylenation step). These observations are further supported by the fact that urinary clearance was rather constant while nonrenal clearance was dose dependent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt has previously been postulated that individuals genetically deficient for the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6 (about 10% of the Caucasian people) were at risk of developing acute toxicity at moderate doses of MDMA because the drug would accumulate in the body instead of being metabolized and inactivated. The lack of linearity of MDMA pharmacokinetics (in a window of doses compatible with its recreational use) is a more general phenomenon as it concerns the whole population independent of their CYP2D6 genotype. It implies that relatively small increases in the dose of MDMA ingested are translated to disproportionate rises in MDMA plasma concentrations and hence subjects are more prone to develop acute toxicity.", "outbound_citations": ["10381769", "10080649", "9635954", "9311621", "9264312", "8889680", "8857570", "8646128", "8627536", "8788485", "7909223", "8101380", "1353554", "2572003", "2893845", "2880944", "3569022", "4064464", "PMC2351249"], "inbound_citations": ["36873994", "36555419", "36498963", "36088153", "36184377", "35651589", "35605796", "36218281", "33993135", "33971177", "33444603", "34513628", "32554172", "32228243", "31641009", "31425490", "31812710", "30815856", "31455855", "30059885", "28978251", "30001118", "28341944", "28506818", "29101905", "28254532", "28087314", "27658484", "27272068", "27830575", "27693156", "27773601", "27809671", "27251771", "26967321", "26769917", "26857462", "26482953", "26395866", "24495461", "26073279"], "label": "0"}

The long-term study was conducted in a study sample of 40 young patients (age 14-22 years) following a mean of 3.4 years of neuroleptic treatment. During the study, 20 patients received clozapine, and the other 20 patients were treated with standard neuroleptic medications. At the beginning of the open clinical trials, the patients had already been receiving clozapine treatment for 24 +/- 15 months. Assessment of the biochemical and psychopathological measures was performed on six occasions at consecutive 6-week intervals during maintenance treatment with clozapine or conventional neuroleptics. Blood levels of serotonin, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG), norepinephrine, and epinephrine were significantly higher in clozapine-treated patients than in conventionally treated patients. During long-term treatment, higher serotonin levels were associated with significantly fewer negative symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas higher MHPG levels were correlated with less depression. The short-term effects of clozapine were assessed in a second and independent study sample. After failing on conventional neuroleptics in clinical trials lasting a mean of 1.6 years, 15 inpatients (aged 11-20 years) received clozapine. Weekly ratings of psychopathological symptoms using standard rating scales were performed in parallel to blood samplings for measurements of biogenic amines and serum levels of clozapine. These measures were obtained for 6 weeks during conventional neuroleptic treatment and for 6 weeks during the open-label clozapine trial. Serum levels of serotonin and plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly higher during treatment with clozapine than during pretreatment with typical neuroleptics. A comparison of plasma epinephrine levels in responders (n = 7) and nonresponders (n = 8) to clozapine revealed that response to clozapine can be predicted by epinephrine levels prior to initiation of treatment with clozapine (responders ranging from 32.2 to 90.3 pg/ml; nonresponders ranging from 92.5 to 473.5 pg/ml). Additionally, subjects who responded to clozapine showed increased mean plasma concentrations of MHPG and epinephrine during treatment with this drug in comparison to the levels measured during pretreatment with typical neuroleptic medication. Nonresponders to clozapine failed to show this increase. Finally, in responders to clozapine a negative linear relationship between negative symptoms of schizophrenia and the concentrations of plasma norepinephrine and serum serotonin were observed. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that plasma epinephrine levels prior to initiation of clozapine therapy predict response to this atypical neuroleptic. Our findings derived from short-term and maintenance treatment with clozapine suggest involvement of norepinephrine, epinephrine and serotonin in the therapeutic actions of the atypical neuroleptic clozapine.", "outbound_citations": ["1678267", "8836936", "417371", "2682731", "8599393", "9231304", "8925253", "8596656", "8602893", "7562537", "7539288", "7840349", "7746841", "7660848", "7859111", "7961554", "7961584", "7961557", "8056728", "7520035", "8179790", "7701279", "8138523", "7701277", "8252722", "7684072", "8483973", "8471131", "8428878", "1494593", "1375019", "1418884", "1537770", "1681750", "1860935", "2039760", "2403629", "3182166", "3688286", "3698283", "7165477", "1685791", "3765897"], "inbound_citations": ["35242029", "34023734", "33335492"], "label": "0"}

Methods: We performed a double-masked, placebo-controlled study to compare the efficacy of the application of 0.2% brimonidine and 0.5% apraclonidine for the effect of IOP, systemic blood pressure and heart rate in 20 newly diagnosed ocular hypertensive patients. Effects on the untreated fellow eye and ocular side effects were also determined. All measurements were performed 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after the instillation of one drop. Results: Brimonidine and apraclonidine significantly reduced IOP from baseline at all observation times. No significant difference was observed between the treatment groups. IOP decreased significantly in the untreated fellow eye in the brimonidine group at 4-, 6- and 8-hour checks and at 6-hour checks in the apraclonidine group when compared with placebo. Blood pressure and heart rate decreased significantly in the brimonidine group compared with placebo. Apraclonidine did not affect blood pressure or heart rate any differently than placebo. The pupil diameter and the interpalpebral fissure width significantly increased in the apraclonidine group, but not in the brimonidine group. There were no significant differences in the overall incidence of foreign body sensation, burning and stinging and dry mouth in the treatment groups. Conclusions: In the short-term, brimonidine was effective in reducing IOP in patients with elevated IOP and was equivalent in efficacy to apraclonidine.

We used DerSimonian and Laird's random-effects model to analyze pooled patient data from available randomized, double-masked, comparative trials of risperidone and haloperidol in patients with schizophrenia treated for at least 4 weeks at recommended doses. The purpose of the analysis was to determine whether there are significant overall differences in the rates of patient clinical response, prescription of anticholinergic agents, and treatment dropout. Six of the nine trials revealed in a literature search met all criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that in patients with chronic schizophrenia, risperidone therapy is associated with significantly higher response rates, significantly less prescribing of anticholinergic medication, and significantly lower treatment dropout rates than haloperidol.

However, a high incidence of severe adverse reactions highlights the need to find more favourable treatments. Atypical antipsychotics may combine efficacy in ameliorating some autistic symptoms with a lower incidence of some adverse reactions. This article reviews the use of atypical antipsychotics in autistic disorder, with particular focus on behaviour, cognition and physical well-being. Thirteen studies using risperidone, three using olanzapine, one using clozapine, one using amisulpride and one using quetiapine were identified. Few firm conclusions can be drawn due to the limitations of the studies; however, there is an indication that risperidone may be effective in reducing hyperactivity, aggression and repetitive behaviours, often without inducing severe adverse reactions. Olanzapine and clozapine may also be effective; however, there is little evidence for using amisulpride or quetiapine in this population. Randomized trials are required to clarify the effectiveness of these agents.", "outbound_citations": ["11468931", "11099280", "10711911", "10674777", "10511014", "10230185", "9934941", "10097998", "10461820", "10630457", "10077288", "9884683", "9735606", "9672054", "9656134", "9549957", "9444894", "9291716", "9229261", "9183140", "9136504", "9466234", "9133768", "8936923", "8615435", "9231311", "8927675", "8655658", "7527293", "7520110", "1350581", "1513923", "2684084", "2663834", "2723129", "2914841", "2887090", "3950262", "6385731", "6756027", "7204797", "370186"], "inbound_citations": ["36014340", "35131336", "33626921", "33417375", "33280640", "32845025", "31219188", "30381235", "28545371", "30551323", "29644586", "29520663", "29475229", "28704788", "28213188", "28368272", "28210827", "28185044", "27624381", "27409138", "26257243"], "label": "0"}

They suggest, on this basis, that thioridazine therapy might be more effective than risperidone or haloperidol to treat clozapine withdrawalinduced relapse because thioridazine has some ability to block D 4 receptors and is administered in doses similar to those of clozapine.

There is currently little information about their comparative efficacy from head-to-head clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to examine the comparative efficacy of clozapine and risperidone for positive and negative symptoms, depression, parkinsonian side effects, and indexes of neuroendocrine function in schizophrenic patients who met a priori criteria for partial response to traditional neuroleptic agents.\n\n\nMETHOD\nAfter a baseline fluphenazine treatment period, 29 patients participated in a 6-week, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of the effects of these agents.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClozapine was superior to risperidone for positive symptoms and parkinsonian side effects, but there were no significant differences between the drugs on two measures of negative symptoms, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total scores, and depression scores. The clozapine patients, but not the risperidone patients, demonstrated significant reductions from the fluphenazine baseline in positive symptoms, total symptoms, and depression. In addition, clozapine produced fewer effects on plasma prolactin than risperidone or fluphenazine. The mean daily doses during week 6 of the trial were 403.6 mg of clozapine and 5.9 mg of risperidone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings from this study indicate that these drugs have both important differences and similarities in their comparative efficacy in chronically ill, partially responsive patients with schizophrenia.

On several of the subscales (dyskinesia, buccolinguomasticatory, and Clinical Global Impression severity of dyskinesia), mean change scores were significantly lower in some of the risperidone groups than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). At the clinically most effective risperidone dose (6 mg/day), the mean ESRS change score was not significantly different from that of the placebo group. A significant linear relationship was noted between mean change scores and increasing risperidone dose on 4 of the 12 ESRS subscales; nevertheless, even at 16 mg/day of risperidone, mean change scores were lower than in the haloperidol group. A linear relationship between increasing risperidone dose and use of antiparkinsonian medications was also apparent. Acute dystonic reactions occurred both in patients receiving risperidone and haloperidol. Patients with severe baseline EPS were at higher risk of EPS during the study than patients with low or moderate baseline EPS.

We performed a long-term comparison of a newer, atypical antipsychotic drug, risperidone, and an older, conventional neuroleptic drug, haloperidol, in terms of the rate of relapse in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a double-blind, prospective study at 40 sites, we randomly assigned adult outpatients in stable condition with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to receive treatment with flexible doses of either risperidone or haloperidol for a minimum of one year.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 397 patients who underwent randomization, data from 2 were excluded because they did not receive study medication; data from all 30 patients from one site were excluded by the sponsor, the Janssen Research Foundation, because of concern about the integrity of the data. The median duration of treatment was 364 days in the risperidone group and 238 days in the haloperidol group (P=0.02). Of the 177 patients assigned to risperidone and the 188 assigned to haloperidol who remained in the analysis, 44.1 percent and 52.7 percent, respectively, discontinued treatment for reasons other than relapse. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the risk of relapse at the end of the study was 34 percent for the risperidone group and 60 percent for the haloperidol group (P<0.001); the risk ratio for relapse with haloperidol, from the Cox model, was 1.93 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.33 to 2.80; P<0.001). Early discontinuation of treatment for any reason was more frequent among haloperidol-treated patients (risk ratio, 1.52; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.18 to 1.96). Patients in the risperidone group had greater reductions in the mean severity of both psychotic symptoms and extrapyramidal side effects than those in the haloperidol group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdult outpatients with clinically stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder have a lower risk of relapse if they are treated with risperidone than if they are treated with haloperidol.", "outbound_citations": ["10711914", "10190229", "10037163", "9690975", "10178499", "9433357", "9468354", "9406266", "9448657", "9270900", "9050121", "9366000", "8911225", "8941166", "7637483", "7481573", "7514366", "1679255", "3046553", "3616518"], "inbound_citations": ["37066004", "36965364", "36634452", "36302861", "36032231", "35940088", "35770081", "35524620", "35695576", "35217671", "34808414", "34933680", "34711835", "34120548", "34052461", "33960095", "33735719", "33637749", "31604607", "32871013", "32667636", "32624027", "32606705", "32387789", "32053567", "32093460", "31767510", "31909750", "31688450", "31903029", "31343440", "31308636", "31217000", "31190660", "30940400", "30994855", "30540617", "31523418", "29804929", "30192088", "30147350", "29506749", "34079927", "29511333", "29164930", "28734907", "28865716", "28142068", "28096881", "27566723", "27977041", "27829454", "27765033", "27648956", "27265548", "26974214", "26840618", "27124697", "27106681", "27078222", "27052109", "26848792", "27016729", "26955982", "26902950", "24690088", "26607102", "26792993", "26645209", "23773886", "27864791", "26395153", "26431793", "26343461", "26196189", "26549958", "26293744", "25820612", "26241954", "26629117", "25934131", "25547440", "24870446"], "label": "0"}

During the initial 2 months of the study, the children were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) only, and for the remaining 2 months, methylphenidate was added at a morning dose of 0.3 mg/kg. They underwent neurologic assessment, brain computed tomography, IQ testing, and assessment with the Childhood Behavior Checklist at baseline before methylphenidate therapy. Electroencephalography, AED determinations, and the continuous-performance task (CPT) test were done at baseline and after 2 months of methylphenidate therapy. A double-blind, crossover design was used to compare the effects of methylphenidate versus placebo on an electroencephalogram, AED levels, and the CPT. On the 2 days of testing, the child received AEDs and a capsule containing either placebo or methylphenidate. None of the 25 children of this sample who were seizure free had attacks while taking methylphenidate. Of the 5 children with seizures, 3 had an increase in attacks, whereas the other 2 showed no change or a reduction. There were no significant changes in AED levels or electroencephalographic findings. Methylphenidate benefited 70% of children according to parental report; methylphenidate also enhanced performance on the CPT. Side effects of methylphenidate were mild and transient. Methylphenidate is effective in treating children with epilepsy and ADHD and safe in children who are seizure free.

ERPs were recorded during an auditory selective attention task (SAT) that involved detecting infrequent long-duration target tones presented among short-duration tones that varied in location (left vs. right ear) and pitch (low vs. high). Amphetamine users (n = 19) were divided into two groups, high dependence (n = 10) and low dependence (n = 10), based on amphetamine Severity of Dependence Scale scores, and compared to an age-matched control group (n = 9). The high-dependence group showed slowed reaction time and reduced early processing negativity and peak N1 amplitude to location-relevant nontarget stimuli. Poor performance on the SAT was highly correlated with deficits in early processing, which were also related to poor performance on the Wechsler Memory Scale Attention/Concentration index. It is suggested that severely dependent users suffer an inability to selectively enhance the sensory processing of relevant auditory information. This may produce poor automatic preferential processing of relevant information and increase load on limited attentional resources.", "outbound_citations": ["9449023", "9293043", "9246558", "9211446", "7652110", "7640328", "7795497", "7987184", "8104133", "8434083", "7681390", "1806953", "1714809", "1758927", "2054435", "2054568", "2247551", "2450735", "3615753", "3615759", "3527341", "3929107", "6220115", "7156260", "6172256", "7288462", "7196265", "6159179", "4729903", "4551260", "5459137"], "inbound_citations": ["36975225"], "label": "0"}

This study compared the acute and long-term effectiveness of haloperidol with that of olanzapine in patients with first-episode psychosis in a large, controlled clinical trial.\n\n\nMETHOD\nPatients with first-episode psychosis (N=263) were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive haloperidol or olanzapine and were followed for up to 104 weeks. Domains measured included psychopathology, psychosocial variables, neurocognitive functioning, and brain morphology and metabolism. This report presents data from clinical measures of treatment response and safety data from the 12-week acute treatment phase.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHaloperidol and olanzapine were associated with substantial and comparable baseline-to-endpoint reductions in symptom severity, which did not differ significantly in last-observation-carried-forward analyses. However, in a mixed-model analysis, olanzapine-treated subjects had significantly greater decreases in symptom severity as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score and negative and general scales and by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale but not as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive scale and by the Clinical Global Impression severity rating. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced a lower rate of treatment-emergent parkinsonism and akathisia but had significantly more weight gain, compared with the haloperidol-treated patients. Overall, significantly more olanzapine-treated subjects than haloperidol-treated subjects completed the 12-week acute phase of the study (67% versus 54%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs expected on the basis of previous studies, both olanzapine and haloperidol were effective in the acute reduction of psychopathological symptoms in this group of patients with first-episode psychosis. However, olanzapine had several relative advantages in therapeutic response. Although the nature of adverse events differed between the two agents, retention in the study was greater with olanzapine. Retention in treatment is important in this patient population, given their risk of relapse.

Our objective was to examine whether specific types of drug abuse preceded or followed the onset of depression. A retrospective, blinded case-controlled assessment of the drug and depressive history of depressed outpatients was conducted. Three hundred seventy-five patients with major depressive disorder were evaluated for comorbid drug dependence using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). They were selected from the psychiatric outpatient department of a metropolitan teaching hospital and grouped into homogeneous classes of drug dependence including alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, LSD, hypnosedative, opiate, and polysubstance use. We determined the percent of depressed patients with each specific type of drug abuse, their age of onset of depression and onset of specific drug abuse, and the mean number of lifetime depressive episodes for each patient. We found that alcohol dependence followed the onset of first life depression by 4.7 years (P = .02, two-tailed). Among polydrug-dependent patients, each drug abused followed the onset of depression, except for LSD, which coincided with the onset of depression. Among polydrug users, cocaine dependence occurred 6.8 years after the first major depressive episode (P = .007) and alcohol dependence 4.5 years after the onset of depression (P = .007). Opiate and sedative users had the least number of lifetime depressive episodes (3.7), and LSD and cocaine users had the greatest number (12.2).

An axillary brachial plexus block was performed with 40 mL 1% mepivacaine plus 1:200,000 epinephrine. The control group received no clonidine. In the other groups, increasing doses of clonidine (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 micro g/kg) were added to the local anesthetic solution. Onset time, duration of anesthesia and analgesia, postoperative pain score, intake of analgesics, and adverse effects were recorded. The eight groups were comparable in terms of onset time, postoperative pain score, and analgesic requirement. The minimum dose of clonidine required to significantly prolong the duration of analgesia and anesthesia was, respectively, 0.1 and 0.5 micro g/kg. No side effects (sedation, drowsiness, bradycardia, arterial hypotension) were reported. We conclude that the dose of clonidine required to prolong significantly the duration of both anesthesia and analgesia after axillary brachial plexus blockade is 0.5 micro g/kg and that, at this dose, clonidine may be used without important reported side effects even in outpatients.

The model was used to calculate treatment outcomes and total direct treatment costs from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Service over 5 years. The PRIZE study showed that quetiapine treatment resulted in a higher response rate and better tolerability than haloperidol treatment. These benefits have the potential to improve compliance and reduce relapse rates. The model showed that the higher acquisition cost of quetiapine was offset by lower costs for other medications, hospitalization, and other medical services. The total treatment cost over 5 years was 38,106 pounds for quetiapine and 38,350 pounds for haloperidol, a cost saving of 244 pounds in favor of quetiapine. Quetiapine-treated patients also spent longer in response states and experienced fewer relapses. Sensitivity analysis showed these results to be robust across a range of conditions. Quetiapine has the potential to improve outcomes compared with haloperidol in partial responders with schizophrenia, at a slightly lower total cost. The higher acquisition cost of quetiapine was offset by savings in other medical costs. Quetiapine could significantly improve the management of this patient group, without increasing the economic burden on the health service.", "outbound_citations": ["10870870", "10722180", "10394475", "10389607", "10078501", "10625196", "10037163", "9783349", "9545995", "10178497", "9522115", "9524981", "9350955", "9270900", "9193196", "9524789", "7872842", "7872841", "7481573", "7865193", "8279933", "8246705", "8332569", "1357703", "2327487", "2343745", "3046553", "3215645", "2873851", "2983014"], "inbound_citations": ["33505160", "30128087"], "label": "0"}

The purpose of the present study was to assess the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction between olanzapine and carbamazepine, since these agents are likely to be used concomitantly in the treatment of manic psychotic disorder. The pharmacokinetics of two single therapeutic doses of olanzapine were determined in 11 healthy volunteers. The first dose of olanzapine (10 mg) was taken alone and the second dose (10 mg) after 2 weeks of treatment with carbamazepine (200 mg BID). Measurement of urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol excretion was used as an endogenous marker to confirm that induction of CYP3A4 by carbamazepine had occurred. The dose of olanzapine given after a 2-week pretreatment with carbamazepine was cleared more rapidly than olanzapine given alone. Olanzapine pharmacokinetic values for Cmax and AUC were significantly lower after the second dose, the elimination half-life was significantly shorter, and the clearance and volume of distribution were significantly increased. Carbamazepine has been shown to induce several P450 cytochromes including CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. Since CYP1A2 plays a role in the metabolic clearance of olanzapine, the interaction may be attributed to induction of CYP1A2 by carbamazepine, leading to increased first-pass and systemic metabolism of olanzapine. The interaction is not considered to be of clinical significance because olanzapine has a wide therapeutic index, and the changes in plasma concentration of olanzapine are within the fourfold variation that occurs without concern for safety in a patient population.", "outbound_citations": ["9491835", "9010634", "8632334", "7550985", "7974626", "8466541", "1458773", "1616599", "2590599", "3190986", "3179165", "6129885", "6749872"], "inbound_citations": ["35795225", "35335907", "33322313", "33111191", "32107798", "31919994", "31885304", "31158489", "31271537", "30121590", "28919358", "28783998", "27117554", "26896788", "26936044", "26107820", "26168917", "27129010", "24199723", "24170642", "23641727", "23761048", "23492908", "23016553", "23121279", "22332980", "21602592", "21127693", "19636338", "19682433", "11554425", "19371315", "18245032", "12102620", "17984856", "17346248", "17414943", "17214606", "17285099", "17164690", "17038872", "16805946", "16454538", "16379519", "15829439", "15545309", "15853522", "15298648", "14604595", "14659985", "14691614", "16232141", "14703714", "12878435", "12895191", "12782438", "12640212", "12667944", "12670127", "12548144", "12899737", "12352274", "12202454", "12410063", "12142637", "12172335", "12142636", "12647979", "12404680", "12007677", "11972442", "11903482", "11798083", "11700004", "19811029", "11477325", "11254196", "11407129", "11569525", "11217867", "11700151", "11249551", "10511917", "10517347", "24940062"], "label": "0"}

However, investigators have been unable to clearly demonstrate this association when compared with a control group receiving conventional antipsychotics.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMedical and pharmacy claims from the Iowa Medicaid program were used to compare incidence rates for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension in 552 patients receiving clozapine and 2461 patients receiving conventional antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, chlorpromazine hydrochloride), with the use of a retrospective cohort design. Logistic regression was used to compare incidence rates adjusting for age, sex, and duration of available follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant differences in overall incidence rates for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or hypertension were observed in patients receiving clozapine vs conventional antipsychotics. However, among younger patients (aged 20-34 years), clozapine administration was associated with a significantly increased relative risk of diabetes (2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.4]) and hyperlipidemia (2.4 [95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.2]), but not hypertension (0.9 [95% confidence interval, 0.4-2.0]).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data suggest that clozapine may not be an independent cause of diabetes or hyperlipidemia, but instead acts as an effect modifier in susceptible populations by increasing weight or affecting insulin secretion and resistance. This finding requires confirmation in other settings and patient populations and with the other atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine fumarate). The potential long-term medical and economic implications of the early induction of diabetes and hyperlipidemia in patients with schizophrenia warrant further study.", "outbound_citations": ["12502614", "10907975", "10831479", "10584769", "10553730", "10610018", "10479950", "10484968", "10485643", "9798083", "9671341", "9108812", "8870896", "8770530", "8067501", "8446523", "2876011"], "inbound_citations": ["36994117", "34206460", "33826090", "33715645", "33716966", "33409919", "32195772", "30675684", "30428460", "29950586", "29796248", "29344339", "29162032", "28266722", "28808933", "28584269", "29456332", "27796257", "27507689", "27403239", "26934282", "27507689"], "label": "0"}

Over a one-to two-week period, quetiapine doses were escalated to 300 mg twice daily (bid). Patients were then treated for at least 7 days at the target quetiapine dose and subsequently entered into the combination therapy period, receiving haloperidol (7.5 mg, bid), risperidone (3 mg, bid), or thioridazine (200 mg, bid) for 8.5 days (after 3 days of dose escalation).

Neither risperidone nor haloperidol had significant effects on quetiapine pharmacokinetics.

The Quetiapine Experience with Safety and Tolerability (QUEST) study compared the relative safety, tolerability, and efficacy of quetiapine and risperidone in outpatients with a broad range of psychotic symptoms. This was a multicenter, 4-month, open-label, randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive quetiapine or risperidone. Doses were adjusted to maximize efficacy and to minimize adverse events. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed with an EPS checklist; adverse events were recorded. Efficacy was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). A total of 728 patients were randomized, 553 to quetiapine and 175 to risperidone. Mean prescribed doses over the study period were 253.9 mg/d quetiapine and 4.4 mg/d risperidone. At the end of 4 months, EPS declined in both treatment groups, but quetiapine-treated patients were significantly less likely to require dose adjustment or concurrent anti-EPS medication (P < 0.001). The most common adverse events in the quetiapine and risperidone groups were somnolence (31.3% and 15.4%, respectively), dry mouth (14.5% and 6.9%), and dizziness (12.7% and 6.9%). Overall, tolerance to side effects with the 2 drugs, measured by dropout rates, was comparable. At each visit, a higher percentage of quetiapine-treated patients showed improvement on the CGI scale, but there were no significant between-group differences on the PANSS. At end point, quetiapine-treated patients had significantly lower HAM-D scores (P = 0.028). The results of this study suggest that quetiapine is as effective as risperidone for the treatment of psychotic symptoms, is more effective for depressive symptoms, may have a more favorable EPS profile, and has comparable overall tolerability.", "outbound_citations": ["10956570", "10937608", "10868465", "10811240", "24926579", "10811237", "10401441", "10360126", "12973385", "9988841", "9892302", "9818633", "9545995", "9524981", "9680049", "9270900", "9193196", "9090331", "8927658", "7545060", "7537287", "7514366", "7683702", "3046553", "3616518", "6080235"], "inbound_citations": ["34585228", "36101867", "32750027", "29288677", "29284810", "28810270", "26089815", "25632293", "25356632", "24794100", "24681810", "24847992", "24175720", "24175721", "23953270", "23391164", "23281876", "24293180", "23234465", "22848184", "22834451", "23265762", "22005160", "21385106", "21249678", "22212877", "21069690", "20924243", "20814318", "20795889", "20963366", "20334680", "19963277", "19809337", "21240151", "18303093", "19570499", "19668121", "19698898", "19320529", "19531813", "18455360", "18408528", "18439263", "18243663", "24937712", "24916499", "18072814", "17629731", "17542047", "19300555", "17335334", "17244172", "24941277", "24937556", "24941362", "17029303", "16797162", "16893149", "16869337", "16542323", "16403851", "16449469", "16204326", "24940961", "16509050", "16175656", "16282834", "16139989", "16026484", "15948765", "15933479", "16062094", "15876912", "15880391", "15969892", "16104066", "15934906", "15849974", "24945332", "24937792", "15733025", "24930548", "15572264", "16279863", "15618854", "15289701", "15383198", "15383183", "15284187", "15265246", "14871161", "15530131", "23570195", "12923822", "19810926", "12765737", "12974516", "12832945", "12720475", "12728783", "12504069", "24937244", "14594518", "12562143", "12523876", "12408887", "12227084", "11913677", "12046640", "11911552", "10796560"], "label": "0"}

Each subject participated for 16 weeks (weeks 1-4 CLON/placebo dose titration, weeks 5-8 added MPH/placebo dose titration, weeks 9-16 maintenance therapy).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-seven children were administered MPH alone, 34 were administered CLON alone, 33 were administered CLON + MPH, and 32 were administered placebo. For our primary outcome measure of ADHD (Conners Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire--Teacher), significant improvement occurred for subjects assigned to CLON (p < 0.002) and those assigned to MPH (p < 0.003). Compared with placebo, the greatest benefit occurred with combined CLON + MPH (p < 0.0001). CLON appeared to be most helpful for impulsivity and hyperactivity; MPH appeared to be most helpful for inattention. The proportion of individual subjects reporting a worsening of tics as an adverse effect was no higher in those treated with MPH (20%) than those being administered CLON alone (26%) or placebo (22%). Compared with placebo, measured tic severity lessened in all active treatment groups in the following order: CLON + MPH, CLON alone, MPH alone. Sedation was common with CLON treatment (28% reported moderate or severe sedation), but otherwise the drugs were tolerated well, including absence of any evident cardiac toxicity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMethylphenidate and clonidine (particularly in combination) are effective for ADHD in children with comorbid tics. Prior recommendations to avoid methylphenidate in these children because of concerns of worsening tics are unsupported by this trial.", "outbound_citations": ["11431228", "10746603", "10197827", "9136493", "9136492", "7559307", "7770313", "7860456", "7860457", "8164829", "8496131", "1358442", "1592778", "1564021", "2009034", "2228981", "2684084", "2768152", "3300518", "2868428", "3461891", "2862607", "3973249", "6639293", "6120250", "6113096", "670589"], "inbound_citations": ["36971690", "36982345", "36854394", "36628546", "35697393", "35697396", "35107785", "35107785", "34975586", "34286606", "34248714", "34089145", "34003210", "33743944", "34178574", "30294996", "32856174", "32488109", "32641910", "32286097", "32156255", "32279714", "31955299", "34316614", "31206903", "31356288", "31295410", "31413891", "31135892", "31061209", "31045720", "31045720", "30919519", "30977108", "30773283", "31727209", "31731911", "30501439", "29944175", "29963275", "29781408", "29781408", "29735111", "29219631", "29219631", "29335879", "29735110", "28915150", "28700715", "28289952", "28277842", "28280480", "28280480", "28451624", "28805580", "27535650", "27535650", "27527544", "27453079", "27270192", "27429744", "26862512", "26862512", "25791488", "25791488", "26786936", "26807330", "26599576", "26585576", "26585576", "26299294", "26299291", "26022170", "25919708", "25919708"], "label": "1"}

In this study we examined changes in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors and motor and vocal tics during withdrawal from long-term maintenance therapy with stimulant medication. Methods. Subjects were 19 children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and chronic tic disorder who had received methylphenidate (n = 17) or dextroamphetamine (n = 2) for a minimum of 1 year. Children were switched to placebo under double-blind conditions. Treatment effects were assessed by using direct observations of child behavior in a simulated (clinic-based) classroom and behavior rating scales completed by parents and clinician. Results. There was no change (group data) in the frequency or severity of motor tics or vocal tics during the placebo condition compared with maintenance dose of stimulant medication (ie, no evidence of tic exacerbation while receiving medication or of a withdrawal reaction). There was no evidence of tic exacerbation in the evening as a rebound effect. Treatment with the maintenance dose was also associated with behavioral improvement in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors, indicating continued efficacy. Conclusions. Abrupt withdrawal of stimulant medication in children receiving long-term maintenance therapy does not appear to result in worsening of tic frequency or severity.

Cumulative improvement was estimated by computing the area under the improvement curve. This measure was then combined with cost data, reflecting consumption of societal resources to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.\n\n\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nClozapine was significantly more effective than haloperidol on measures of symptoms (p = .02) and side effects (p < .0001), with nonsignificant trends in the positive direction on community role functioning (p = .06), family relationships (p = .23), social relationships (p = .30), and daily activities (p = .20). Clozapine was also more effective than haloperidol on the one-year cumulative Composite Health Index for Schizophrenia (p < .0001 for all weighting schemes). After converting this measure to a 0-1 Worst Health-Good Health Scale analogous to Quality Adjusted Life Years, clozapine was found to yield a small improvement of .049 Worst Health-Good Health Units as compared to an improvement of only .027 Units for haloperidol (p < .0001). Average annual costs were $2,733 lower for clozapine (95% C.I. = -$9,220 to $3,754). Although clozapine was significantly more effective than haloperidol, the summary cost-effectiveness ratio had a wide 95 percent confidence interval ranging from -$431,585 to $177,352.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMethods demonstrate an approach to using conventional disease-specific measures to evaluate the cumulative effectiveness of novel treatments for psychotic disorders and for expressing their economic effect as cost-effectiveness ratios. Among high hospital users with refractory schizophrenia, clozapine is more cost-effective than standard treatment, although the magnitude of its effect is small and there is considerable uncertainty about the cost estimates.", "outbound_citations": ["8993092", "8803647", "4917967", "6474101", "3616518", "3046553", "1357741", "8515788", "8100642", "8332569", "8357299", "8105705", "8302107", "8188199", "7755110", "9295240"], "inbound_citations": ["35047708", "28125386", "27454214"], "label": "0"}

The purpose of the present study was to determine the concentration-effect relationship of risperidone by assessing the EEG effect after oral administrations of single dose risperidone in healthy young males. Nine healthy male volunteers received a 1 mg single oral dose of risperidone according to a placebo controlled crossover design. Plasma levels of risperidone and its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured by radioimmunoassay. Quantitative EEG parameters were obtained for each of four frequency bands through spectral EEG analysis. The difference in the absolute power in the delta frequency band for the F3 lead between risperidone and placebo was used as a drug effect parameter. For pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, the hypothetical effect compartment kinetically linked to plasma by a first-order process was postulated. All curve fittings were done with the non-linear curve-fitting program NONLIN. Our results showed that absolute powers in delta and theta frequency bands were higher for risperidone administration than for placebo at all EEG leads, and the maximum effects were detected at about 3 h after administration of the drug. The hysteresis loop was observed in the plot of plasma concentration of risperidone or sum of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone (Cp) versus EEG effect for each subject. A linear model adequately described the relationship between the effect compartment concentrations (Ce) and EEG effects, and the two limbs of hysteresis in the Cp-effect plot were collapsed in the Ce-effect plot for risperidone or risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone. The increases of absolute power for delta and theta frequency bands of EEG were induced by single oral administration of risperidone. The linear PK-PD model fit well with the relationship between effect compartment concentrations (Ce) and EEG effects of risperidone.", "outbound_citations": ["9589515", "9416648", "9209730", "7522149", "7693770", "7690693", "7683702", "1511536", "1505149", "1631250", "1375801", "1381102", "2702793", "2460616", "3068258", "3391000", "3627388", "3330184", "3729056", "4003792", "4029126", "6614540", "6657739", "7339639", "461501", "553334"], "inbound_citations": ["33888660", "29280209", "29643331", "29407464"], "label": "0"}

The compound has a relatively short plasma elimination half-life (approximately 7 h). However, since dopamine D2 receptor occupancies correlate poorly with plasma concentrations of antipsychotics, plasma elimination half-life may not predict either duration of clinical effect or dosing frequency. Accordingly, the efficacy and tolerability of three dosing regimens (450 mg/day given in two or three divided doses daily, and 50 mg/day given twice daily) were compared in a 6-week, double-blind, randomized, multicentre, parallel-group study. The study recruited hospitalized men and women aged 18-65 years meeting DSM-IIIR criteria for acute exacerbation of chronic or subchronic schizophrenia.

At day 42, the last day of randomized treatment and the primary timepoint for efficacy, quetiapine 450 mg/day was more effective than 50 mg/day: 225 mg bd was consistently superior to 25 mg bd in all measures of efficacy (total BPRS, P = 0.006; CGI severity, CGI improvement and SANS, P < 0.03), and 150 mg tid was statistically significantly superior to 25 mg bd with respect to BPRS total score (P = 0.05).

With the characterisation of imidazoline binding sites distinct from 2-adrenoceptors, the consensus became that moxonidine was acting predominantly at imidazoline I1 receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla to lower blood pressure. Moxonidine acts at prejunctional 2-adrenoceptors on sympathetic nerve endings to decrease noradrenaline release and this may contribute to its ability to lower blood pressure. The predominant site of action of moxonidine may also depend on route of administration, with imidazoline I1 receptors being predominant after central, and 2-adrenoceptors predominant after systemic administration. The controversy over the mechanism and site of action with moxonidine is ongoing. In animal models, moxonidine lowers blood pressure, reduces cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling, reduces cardiac arrhythmias and increases blood flow in cerebral ischaemia. Moxonidine also has beneficial effects in animal models of diabetes and kidney disease. Moxonidine increases sodium and water excretion in rats, but not humans. Animal studies indicate that moxonidine may be useful in the treatment of glaucoma by reducing intra-ocular pressure. Animal studies show that moxonidine may also be effective in pain and in ethanol withdrawal. In humans, the pharmacokinetics of moxonidine are of the one-compartment model with first-order absorption. Renal elimination is the major route of elimination and individual titration of moxonidine is needed in patients with renal impairment. There is overwhelming evidence that moxonidine is a safe and effective antihypertensive. A large clinical trial of moxonidine in heart failure, MOXCON, was stopped because of excessive deaths in the moxonidine group. Moxonidine should not be used in patients with heart failure, but there are no obvious reasons to stop its use as an antihypertensive, or its development for other clinical uses.", "outbound_citations": ["10969310", "10906160", "10869394", "10856266", "10844105", "10781010", "10807960", "10799665", "10692615", "10710127", "10676687", "10669492", "10601668", "10578224", "10489096", "10381806", "10392868", "10415940", "10415923", "10369453", "10331415", "10344524", "10217548", "10082261", "9862764", "9851566", "9851564", "9747666", "9733365", "9400012", "9264001", "9228197", "8671960", "8738800", "8632304", "8872298", "8872299", "8938282", "7584524", "8590981", "7677360", "7677377", "7677371", "7677373", "7677382", "7791087", "7773534", "7952868", "7912282", "8032642", "7509387", "7533226", "7533223", "7533224", "7533221", "7533227", "7533222", "8097955", "8380858", "1458765", "1576046", "1781768", "2273081", "2575414", "3191647", "3437071", "3316304"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

From the chart review, thirty-four out of eighty male patients were identified to have reported loss of libido, erectile difficulty, anorgasmia, and delayed ejaculation while receiving pharmacotherapy of selective serotonin reuptake blockers (fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline); tricyclic antidepressants (nortriptyline, imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine, and clomipramine); and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (phenelzine). Method: The authors also discussed the management of these sexual side effects by waiting for spontaneous remission, reducing the dosage level, and substituting the offending drug with other antidepressants. Results: This article underscores the underreported nature of antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction, the high incidence of SSRI-associated sexual side effects, equal potentials in causing sexual side effects among the three SSRI's, the low incidence rate of sexual adverse effects from bupropion, and the minimal need to add an antidote if the side effects are to be managed systematically. Conclusions: Finally, male sexual side effects can occur randomly and involve any sexual phase randomly, and the treatment approaches are similar, regardless of the types of sexual dysfunction associated with antidepressants.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34606837", "31982896", "31304840", "29626770", "30072923", "28481169", "27297028"], "label": "0"}

Although some data support the use of typical antipsychotics in pediatric patients with a variety of psychiatric syndromes, concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents often complicated their use and probably even interfered with case identification. A fundamentally new group of medications, the atypicals, have now become available and may not only have improved tolerability but also may have greater ability to reduce some target symptoms. Because of their superior side-effect profile in adults, some of these atypical treatments probably will be commonly prescribed despite a relative paucity of data about their use in the young. Moreover, although frequently prescribed in this age group, the overall prescription rate for antipsychotics will probably increase because of the putative improved safety profile of the newer agents. However, it is possible that serious side effects, such as tardive dyskinesia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, may occur with these atypical agents. For this reason, the enthusiasm for prescribing these newer treatments should be tempered with the understanding that these agents, although they may in some ways be superior to their predecessors, still possess the potential for significant adverse events. Four atypical antipsychotics are currently marketed in the United States (see Table 2). One additional agent, ziprasodone, is undergoing clinical investigation. Ziprasodone has been shown to be superior to placebo in adults suffering from schizophrenia. Ziprasodone will probably be marketed in the United States in the near future. Whether all of these atypical drugs will have a place in the clinical armamentarium of the pediatric psychopharmacologist remains to be determined. Because the receptor binding profile of the atypical agents differ, it is not possible to assume that what is true for one of these agents is true for the others. Although results from most preliminary studies with atypical antipsychotics indicate that these are promising agents for pediatric patients, further research is needed to define just how these medications may be most judiciously used.", "outbound_citations": ["10461819", "9400342", "9356580", "9334567", "9291716", "9291717", "9265916", "9261669", "9247389", "9376336", "9229261", "9193196", "9330014", "9136504", "9232486", "9136505", "9090331", "9393392", "9114956", "9265911", "9265910", "9265918", "9192542", "9133768", "9090333", "8823346", "8956674", "8990820", "8915564", "8947969", "8936904", "8615435", "8919704", "8690831", "8599393", "8713693", "8617698", "8941166", "8633686", "8941170", "9231311", "8941173", "8823350", "8647790", "9231318", "8543539", "8830069", "7592266", "7559308", "7640326", "7573764", "7700379", "7624387", "7703220", "7844684", "7559373", "7527886", "7995796", "7523815", "7943830", "7527022", "7527327", "8071290", "7953013", "8056728", "7514366", "7914047", "8010152", "7909711", "8138519", "7701278", "8085133", "7510574", "8306130", "8238640", "8131384", "8227492", "7909268", "8104930", "8515788", "8103998", "8103996", "8354768", "8489326", "8463445", "7682029", "8427433", "8290679", "1384075", "1410200", "1352677", "1583079", "1513923", "19630650", "1513922", "1680296", "1938800", "2033030", "2375443", "2296371", "19630601", "2574191", "2572030", "2572029", "2665687", "2768542", "2914841", "2460616", "3046553", "3344846", "3276280", "3597292", "2883343", "3521532", "3522818", "3521531", "3731762", "3894338", "3883815", "3970271", "4001299", "6385731", "6146602", "6376480", "6428371", "6371107", "6582810", "6696597", "6691455", "6367494", "6140865", "6138011", "6758492", "7069078", "7040529", "7310026", "6111227", "6109720", "6108081", "6104342", "154301", "347954", "23686", "971031", "812671", "1218", "1093506", "239403", "4610612", "4152054", "4150951", "4729410", "4643046", "5953158", "5918777", "5857617"], "inbound_citations": ["36359338", "34806037"], "label": "0"}

The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine versus those of haloperidol during transition from IM to PO therapy. We used additional data from a previously reported trial to test the hypothesis that the reduction in agitation achieved by IM olanzapine 10 mg or IM haloperidol 7.5 mg would be maintained following transition to 4 days of PO olanzapine or PO haloperidol (5-20 mg/d for both). We also hypothesized that olanzapine would maintain its more favorable extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) safety profile. This was a multinational (hospitals in 13 countries), double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Acutely agitated inpatients with schizophrenia were treated with 1 to 3 IM injections to olanzapine 10 mg or haloperidol 7.5 mg over 24 hours and were entered into a 4-day PO treatment period with the same medication (5-20 mg/d for both). The primary efficacy measurement was reduction in agitation, as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC) score. Adverse events and scores on EPS rating scales were assessed. A total of 311 patients (204 men, 107 women; mean [SD] age, 38.2 [11.6] years) were enrolled (131, 126, and 54 patients in the olanzapine, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively). In all, 93.1% (122/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 92.1% (116/126) of haloperidol-treated patients completed the IM period and entered the PO period; 85.5% (112/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 84.1% (106/126) of haloperidol-treated patients completed the PO period. IM olanzapine and IM haloperidol effectively reduced agitation over 24 hours (mean [SD] PANSS-EC change, -7.1 [4.81 vs -6.7 [4.3], respectively). Reductions in agitation were sustained throughout the PO period with both study drugs (mean [SD] change from PO period baseline, -0.6 [4.8] vs -1.3 [4.4], respectively). During PO treatment, haloperidol-treated patients spontaneously reported significantly more acute dystonia than olanzapine-treated patients (4.3%[5/116] vs 0% [0/122], respectively; P = 0.026) and akathisia (5.2% [6/116] vs 0% [0/122], respectively; P = 0.013). Significantly more haloperidol-treated patients than olanzapine-treated patients met categorical criteria for treatment-emergent akathisia (18.5% [17/92] vs 6.5% [7/107], respectively; P = 0.015). In the acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia in this study, both IM olanzapine 10 mg and IM haloperidol 7.5 mg effectively reduced agitation over 24 hours. This alleviation of agitation was sustained following transition from IM therapy to 4 days of PO treatment (5-20 mg/d for both). During the 4 days of PO treatment, olanzapine-treated patients did not spontaneously report any incidences of acute dystonia, and olanzapine had a superior EPS safety profile to that of haloperidol.

All were candidates for either laser trabeculoplasty or invasive surgical intervention. We enrolled only one eye per patient.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nWe continued to administer maximum-tolerated medical therapy for glaucoma. Patients took the study medication every eight hours. Study medications were either apraclonidine hydrochloride 0.5% or placebo (apraclonidine's vehicle).\n\n\nMAJOR OUTCOME MEASURES\nWe evaluated IOP, IOP change from baseline, and the number of eyes requiring surgery after the addition of study medication.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty one percent of patients treated with apraclonidine maintained adequate IOP control throughout the study, avoiding additional surgery compared to 33.9% patients treated with placebo (P < .001). Apraclonidine treatment resulted in significantly more patients achieving either an additional > or = 20% reduction in IOP from baseline (resulting in an IOP < or = 20 mm Hg) (P < 0.05). The most common ocular complications were conjunctival hyperemia (12.6%), itching and foreign body sensation (6.8%), and tearing (4.5%). The most frequent non-ocular adverse events related to apraclonidine were dry mouth (4.5%) and unusual taste perception (2.2%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nApraclonidine appears safe and efficacious.

Methods Sixty patients, undergoing cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia, were randomly divided in three equal groups to receive, at the end of surgery, an epidural analgesic mixture consisting of 10 mL solution containing 2 mg of morphine diluted with 0.125% bupivacaine plus 1:800,000 epinephrine and 0, 75, or 150 \u03bcg of clonidine. Duration of analgesia was assessed as the pain-free interval between the end of surgery and patient\u2019s first analgesic request. The analgesic mixture was repeated, on patient\u2019s request, to 36 hours after the operation. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and side effects were noted. The total amount of morphine and clonidine delivered was also noted. Results The addition of clonidine (0, 75, or 150 \u03bcg) to morphine significantly increased the duration of postoperative analgesia (P < .0001) (6.27 versus 13.25 and versus 21.55 hours) and reduced the mean total dose of morphine (9.40 mg versus 5.0 mg versus 3.60 mg) (P < .0001). No significant differences in side effects were noted. Conclusions A low dose of clonidine such as 75 \u03bcg doubled the duration of analgesia produced by 2 mg of morphine and a dose of 150 \u03bcg further increased the duration of postoperative complete analgesia without increasing the incidence of side effects. The morphine requirements during the postoperative period (36 hours) was greatly reduced by the addition of clonidine to the analgesic epidural mixture.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36692824", "30522141", "29406172", "28625307", "26861470"], "label": "0"}

However, most studies have examined basic reaction time under static conditions using a single measurement. The aim of the present study was to establish whether any changes occur in simple reaction time during treatment with risperidone or olanzapine in in-patients suffering a relapse of schizophrenia. Seventeen in-patients suffering acute relapse of schizophrenia (DSM IV criteria) and twenty matched, healthy controls participated in an eight-week, double-blind pilot study. The patients were treated with conventional antipsychotics for seven days after admission and were then randomised to the treatment arms with risperidone (4 mg/day) or with olanzapine (10 mg/day) at a fixed dosage in the first week and thereafter in flexible dosages for the remaining seven weeks. Since no differences were found between reaction times of patients treated with risperidone or olanzapine, the two treatment groups were merged in the statistical analysis before being compared with the normal controls. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Simpson Angus Scale and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Reaction time was measured with the Alpha apparatus, connected to a personal computer. All assessments and measurements were conducted four times during the treatment phase of the study. The reaction time of patients was significantly longer than that of the healthy controls (t1 = 17.11; p1 < 0.05). After eight weeks of treatment the reaction time of patients significantly improved but did not reach that of the healthy controls (t4 = 28.18, p4 < 0.05). Furthermore, the improved reaction time in the patients did not correlate with improvement of psychopathological symptoms or with improved extrapyramidal symptoms.

The initial clinical file failed to show that selegiline had any benefit in these indications.

(5) The side effects of selegiline are similar to those of other antiparkinsonian drugs and amphetamine. Notable side effects include cardiovascular problems (postural hypotension, atrial fibrillation and arterial hypertension). (6) Selegiline can cause a serotoninergic syndrome and arterial hypertension, so must not be combined with pethidine, tramadol, bupropion, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan or naratriptan. Concurrent treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants should also be avoided. (7) Given the only moderate effects of selegiline in Parkinson's disease, and the possibility of a slight increase in mortality, there is no justification for prescribing this medication in patients with Parkinson's disease.

This multicenter trial examined the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this 4-week double-blind study, 404 patients were randomized to 20 mg/d (n = 101) or 30 mg/d (n = 101) of aripiprazole, placebo (n = 103), or 6 mg/d of risperidone (n = 99). Efficacy assessments included Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and Clinical Global Impression scores. Safety and tolerability evaluations included extrapyramidal symptoms and effects on weight, prolactin, and corrected QT (QTc) interval.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAripiprazole (20 and 30 mg/d) and risperidone (6 mg/d) were significantly better than placebo on all efficacy measures. Separation from placebo occurred at week 1 for PANSS total and positive scores with aripiprazole and risperidone and for PANSS negative scores with aripiprazole. There were no significant differences between aripiprazole and placebo in mean change from baseline in the extrapyramidal symptom rating scales. Mean prolactin levels decreased with aripiprazole but significantly increased 5-fold with risperidone. Mean change in QTc interval did not differ significantly from placebo with any active treatment group. Aripiprazole and risperidone groups showed a similar low incidence of clinically significant weight gain.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAripiprazole is effective, safe, and well tolerated for the positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

However, the recommendation to try some agents at higher doses, particularly olanzapine and quetiapine, suffers the same difficulties the author noted for combination therapy. Namely, this option is not supported by good controlled data, atypicality may be compromised, and the cost increases dramatically. Another espoused alternative, clozapine, while the most effective option for refractory psychosis, can prove challenging to administer. Side effects such as sedation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, orthostasis, agranulocytosis, weight gain, and other metabolic disturbances give many pause. Clozapine is also the most expensive antipsychotic. Our facility recently conducted a review of 193 patients administered 2 or more antipsychotics for 21 days or longer (R.W., M.S., unpublished data, January 2001). Interestingly, we found that the mean cost for clozapine in monotherapy was substantially greater than the mean cost for risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine used concomitantly with another antipsychotic (except clozapine). In fact, of all of the orders for combination therapy, only 19% were more expensive than the mean price of monotherapy with clozapine, and these were all orders for olanzapine with risperidone. There are many practical reasons why atypical antipsychotics are being coadministered. We know that many patients will be partial responders to any given antipsychotic. To improve response, the available pharmacologic options are limited to switching medication or augmenting the existing medication. Switching medications can be time consuming, there is a risk of relapse, and the odds are that the result will be similar to but not significantly better than with previous medications. Aside from attempts to improve efficacy, combination therapy has also been successful in decreasing the side effects associated with atypical antipsychotics. The amelioration of sedation, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and other metabolic disturbances are pragmatic applications. There is much we do not know regarding the etiology of schizophrenia and the mechanisms of action of the antipsychotic medications. It is quite likely that dopamine, and possibly serotonin, blockade are but 2 factors that produce an antipsychotic effect in a disorder that is increasingly being recognized as heterogeneous. Additionally, it is evident that clinical trials, in part by virtue of their strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, leave out many of the patients who are seen every day in clinics and hospitals. Therefore, the gold standard of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials should be viewed with healthy caution. This is also why anecdotal case studies and naturalistic studies are prevalent and useful in psychiatry, where clinical practice is often the vanguard of innovation. Lastly, monotherapy with conventional drugs, although the least expensive recommendation, risks greater side effects, including tardive movement disorders. It would seem prudent to combine 2 atypical antipsychotics that have benign side effects, especially when considering the practical issues and possibility of enhanced efficacy noted above. Much of the initial use of combination therapy was likely the result of \u201cstalled switches\u201d; however, as experience with the use of the atypical antipsychotics grows, the rational concomitant use of these agents to reduce side effects and/or enhance efficacy appears to be growing.", "outbound_citations": ["12000204", "12000203", "11784215", "11777998", "11772844", "11379825", "11411819", "11221496", "11235934", "11524559", "11106145", "15101877", "10949061", "11029681", "10664642", "10536124", "10340685", "10340682", "10453794", "10192829", "10200732", "9710298", "9186019", "9121808", "7540800", "7987511", "8215752", "8127926", "1535121", "3573170", "3779285", "6473689", "15137", "4436900"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted to determine the effect of modafinil on sustained attention performance and functional quality of life in OSA/HS patients with residual daytime sleepiness, who were regular users of nCPAP therapy. Seventy-seven patients received modafinil (200 mg/day, week 1; 400 mg/day, weeks 2-4) and 80 patients received matching placebo once daily for 4 weeks. Sustained attention performance on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and functional status and quality of life using the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) were measured. The frequency of lapses of attention during PVT performance was significantly decreased, and both the median and slowest reaction times were significantly improved in patients receiving nCPAP plus modafinil compared with those receiving nCPAP plus placebo (P=0.010 for the number of lapses [transformed], P=0.023 for the median reaction time, and P=0.014 for the reciprocal of the 10% slowest reaction times). Treatment with nCPAP plus modafinil significantly improved the FOSQ total score (weeks 1 and 4), the vigilance subscale score (weeks 1 and 4), and the activity level subscale score (week 4) compared with treatment with nCPAP plus placebo (all P<0.05). Consistent with previous results for objective and subjective measures of sleepiness, modafinil used adjunctively improved performance on a test of behavioral alertness and reduced functional impairments in patients with OSA/HS who were regular users of nCPAP therapy but still experiencing sleepiness.", "outbound_citations": ["12086124", "12683469", "12603781", "12524251", "11897643", "11719309", "11403530", "11330205", "11282766", "11029353", "10828434", "10903224", "10893081", "10875560", "10901116", "10805822", "10895398", "10770144", "10780758", "10767651", "10720292", "10733683", "10757254", "10522937", "10505825", "10505821", "10544379", "10382693", "10351935", "10096265", "10084504", "9927358", "9925072", "11286346", "9700127", "9828847", "9655701", "9708223", "9517603", "9450772", "9412560", "9415942", "9270575", "9351127", "9246139", "9246377", "9231952", "9097352", "9122568", "8899938", "8680676", "8628462", "8564134", "8531966", "8746395", "7656606", "7610310", "7761742", "7910171", "7906330", "8178027", "8264465", "8484626", "8466125", "8491855", "1470802", "1506861", "1593914", "1555458", "1779033", "1798888", "2684554", "2595172", "2754790", "3227226", "3195832", "3289839", "3629088", "3809866", "3769569", "3722349", "6747516", "6111825"], "inbound_citations": ["37155992", "37072022", "37193288", "33645313", "33179591", "31888148", "31695533", "30478802", "29873140", "29065955", "28728622", "28728622", "27865102", "26266479", "26923035", "26846828", "26380760", "25902810", "25902875"], "label": "0"}

In vitro and animal studies have demonstrated both sympatholytic and antiischemic properties. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of mivazerol in patients during perioperative stress, this multicenter phase II clinical trial studied hemodynamic stability and myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing noncardiac surgery.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThree hundred patients, from twenty-three European medical institutions, participated in this placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial. Ninety-eight were given high-dose mivazerol (1.5 micrograms.kg-1.h-1); 99, low-dose mivazerol (0.75 microgram.kg-1.h-1); and 103, placebo, continuously intraoperatively and for 72 h postoperatively. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored for 96 h. Myocardial ischemia was assessed by Holter electrocardiography for at least 8 h before induction of anesthesia until 96 h after surgery. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms and creatine kinase myocardial band isoenzyme levels were obtained before and serially after surgery. Adverse cardiac events were assessed for the intraoperative, early postoperative (0-24 h), and late postoperative (24-72 h) periods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of tachycardia was significantly lower with high-dose mivazerol (vs. placebo) during the intraoperative (30% vs. 51%; P = 0.002), early postoperative (29% vs. 50%; P = 0.002), and late postoperative periods (46% vs. 70%; P = 0.001). Also, the percentage of patients treated for tachycardia was significantly lower with the high dose (vs. placebo) during the early (10% vs. 20%; P = 0.043) and late (6% vs. 15%; P = 0.024) postoperative periods. The incidence of hypertension was significantly lower with both high and low doses (vs. placebo) during the intraoperative period (46% and 43%, respectively, vs. 63%; P = 0.010); treatment was similar at both high and low doses (33% and 34%, respectively, vs. 46%; P = 0.066). The incidence of bradycardia was significantly higher at both dose levels than with placebo during and after drug administration (intraoperatively-3%, 7%, and 9%; early postoperative-0%, 5%, and 6%; late postoperative-0%, 4%, and 6%; after drug-0%, 6%, and 6%; placebo, low-dose, high-dose, respectively), but the need for treatment did not differ for the groups. The incidence of, and treatment for, hypotension were similar for the three groups. Intraoperative myocardial ischemia was significantly lower with high-dose mivazerol than with placebo (20% vs. 34%, respectively, P = 0.026). When intraoperative data were subdivided into emergence vs. nonemergence periods (post boc analysis), the incidence of myocardial ischemia was significantly lower with high-dose mivazerol than with placebo during emergence (11% vs. 30%; P = 0.001). Regarding blood pressure, heart rate, and ischemia, no rebound response occurred in the 12 h after discontinuation of mivazerol. The high-dose, low-dose, and placebo groups did not differ in the incidence of adverse cardiac outcomes (3%, 2%, and 8%, respectively) or the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (2%, 1%, and 6%, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nContinuous, 72-h perioperative administration of mivazerol to high-risk patients appears to be relatively safe, producing no significant hypotension or adverse events but some evidence of bradycardia not associated with adverse clinical events. Mivazerol decreased the incidence of, and treatment for, tachycardia, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia, particularly during high stress periods. Therefore, these salutary effects of mivazerol indicate further study in large-scale trials that assess mivazerol's effects on adverse cardiac outcomes, including death and myocardial infarction.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

This study compared the efficacy, tolerability, and effects on sexual functioning of bupropion sustained release (bupropion SR) and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, patients with recurrent major depression were treated with bupropion SR 150 to 400 mg/d, fluoxetine 20 to 60 mg/d, or placebo for up to 8 weeks.

Four hundred fifty-six patients participated in the study, 150 receiving bupropion SR, 154 fluoxetine, and 152 placebo. The majority of patients in each group completed the study (63% each, bupropion SR [n = 94] and fluoxetine [n = 97]; 67%, placebo [n = 102]). Bupropion SR and fluoxetine were similarly effective in the treatment of depressive symptoms. Beginning at week 2 and continuing throughout the study, significantly more fluoxetine-treated patients experienced orgasm dysfunction than did patients receiving bupropion SR or placebo (P < 0.001); similar results were seen in patients defined as clinical responders (> or =50% decrease from baseline in 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D] total score) (P < 0.001) and in those experiencing remission of depression (HAM-D total score <8) (P < 0.05). At various time points, worsened sexual functioning, sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, and dissatisfaction with sexual functioning in those satistied at baseline were more frequently associated with fluoxetine treatment than with bupropion SR or placebo. Both active treatments were well tolerated. Bupropion SR and fluoxetine were similarly effective and well tolerated in the treatment of depression.

Moreover, neither lofexidine nor clonidine suppressed the subjective discomfort of opioid withdrawal or significantly reduced other autonomic signs of opioid withdrawal, such as lacrimation or rhinorrhea.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data suggest that lofexidine is well tolerated even at supratherapeutic acute doses. However, its failure to modify most signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal suggest that its effective use in spontaneous withdrawal will require concomitant medications for improved therapeutic response.", "outbound_citations": ["7128667", "5626647", "11512037", "9649979", "9031821", "8957147", "8768738", "8866702", "8786543", "8632309", "8561097", "7752296", "8138958", "1376362", "3048954", "2449617", "2413818", "2410178", "3977557", "6702628", "7138234", "7059442", "6890373", "6890372", "7030578", "6112397", "7229119", "7190295", "215166", "502968", "841320", "1235105", "4988589", "6039832", "13097329"], "inbound_citations": ["35774845", "32234267", "31919349", "31791720", "31403015", "29929212", "27712113", "26893118", "27140827"], "label": "0"}

Antipsychotic medications in these individuals may be associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), worsening of depression, and functional impairment. Atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine and risperidone are associated with a decreased incidence of adverse events such as EPS. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine and risperidone for the treatment of depressive symptoms in outpatients with psychosis.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIn this 4-month, multicenter, open-label trial, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio of quetiapine to risperidone, and both drugs were flexibly dosed. Eligible patients had psychoses and demonstrated 1 of several DSM-IV diagnoses, including schizoaffective disorder, bipolar I disorder, major depressive disorder, delusional disorder, Alzheimer's dementia, schizophreniform disorder, vascular dementia, and substance abuse dementia. Patients were classified as mood disordered if they had bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions scale. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) was used to assess the level of depressive symptoms. The primary tolerability assessment was presence or absence of substantial EPS, defined as EPS severe enough to require an alteration in treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 554 patients were randomly assigned to quetiapine and 175 to risperidone. Mean doses at 16 weeks were 318 mg for quetiapine and 4.4 mg for risperidone. Although both agents produced improvements in mean HAM-D scores, quetiapine produced a greater improvement than risperidone in all patients (p =.0015). Within the mood-diagnosed population, incidences of both substantial EPS (p =.001) and at least moderate EPS (p =.0373) occurred significantly less frequently among patients taking quetiapine. For patients with non-mood diagnoses, incidences of substantial EPS were fewer for patients taking quetiapine than for those taking risperidone (p =.062); however, this was not statistically significant.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that quetiapine may be a useful agent in the management of depressive symptoms in patients with psychosis.", "outbound_citations": ["20954430", "11768836", "11681770", "11030483", "11048905", "10826663", "10695644", "10450252", "10362435", "10221288", "9988841", "9559759", "9617509", "9555604", "9639079", "9067070", "8666562", "2244795", "3616518", "7183759", "6080235"], "inbound_citations": ["35571149", "33092112", "29040947", "29355909", "28465247", "27601905", "26644281"], "label": "0"}

The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of SLI381 compared with placebo in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children in a naturalistic school and home setting. A secondary objective was to assess the diurnal variation in responses based on morning and afternoon assessments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 47 sites. After a 1-week washout of any previous stimulant medication, patients were randomized to receive single-daily morning doses of placebo or SLI381 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg for 3 weeks. Participants aged 6 to 12 years inclusive who satisfied Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria diagnosis of ADHD were included. The primary efficacy parameter was the Conners Global Index Scale for Teachers. Secondary efficacy parameters included the Conners Global Index Scale for Parents, the Clinical Global Impressions Scale for improvement, and the Parent Global Assessment for improvement. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events, laboratory tests, and vital signs at each visit during the study. Physical examinations and electrocardiograms were performed at the screening and the end of the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive hundred eighty-four children were randomized, 563 were included in the intent-to-treat population, and 509 completed the entire study. Intention-to-treat analysis of Conners Global Index Scale for Teachers and Conners Global Index Scale for Parents scores revealed significant improvement in morning, afternoon, and late afternoon behavior for all active treatment groups versus placebo. All active treatment groups showed significant dose-related improvement in behavior from baseline. Both the Clinical Global Impressions Scale for improvement and Parent Global Assessment for improvement showed all doses of SLI381 to be superior to placebo at treatment end and both confirmed the dose-response relationship between improvement and the SLI381 dose. The incidence of spontaneously reported adverse events was low and similar for active treatments and placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSLI381 produced consistent, dose-related improvements on all measures of efficacy. The extended-release nature of the SLI381 formulation was shown by continued, significant improvement in afternoon assessments by teachers and afternoon and late afternoon assessments by parents. The time course and therapeutic effects of SLI381 suggests that this medication is an efficacious once-daily treatment for children with ADHD.", "outbound_citations": ["11134474", "10802980", "10638065", "10585981", "10434488", "10405498", "10103335", "10230181", "9787695", "9585655", "9585654", "8624187", "8919704", "8317950", "2387789"], "inbound_citations": ["33185468", "32394557", "32075485", "31913713", "29883938", "30124186", "28278594", "29211967", "28816509", "24071772", "27191217", "26844979"], "label": "1"}

Modal doses at endpoint were 80 mg/day for ziprasidone and 5 mg/day for haloperidol. Improvements in all mean efficacy variables with both ziprasidone and haloperidol were observed. Significantly more patients were categorized as negative symptom responders (> or = 20% reduction in PANSS negative subscale score) in the ziprasidone group (48%) compared with the haloperidol group (33%) (p < .05). Ziprasidone had clear advantages over haloperidol in all evaluations of movement disorders. Changes in body weight were negligible with both treatments. No pattern of laboratory or cardiovascular changes was observed. Ziprasidone and haloperidol were both effective in reducing overall psychopathology; ziprasidone demonstrated effective treatment of negative symptoms and was better tolerated than haloperidol.

Randomized double-blind study. Teaching hospital. 60 ASA physical status I and II adult patients scheduled for unilateral ophthalmologic surgery with peribulbar block. Patients were assigned to one of 4 groups, and premedicated with oral 2 mL volume (clonidine or placebo). The peribulbar eye block consisted of local anesthetics plus 1 mL of the test drug. The control group (CG) received oral saline as premedication and peribulbar saline as the test drugs. The clonidine eye group (Clo-eye G) received oral saline and peribulbar 30 microg clonidine.

The aim of this study was to clarify how the DIEPSS captures EPS profiles. The baseline prevalence and treatment-emergent incidence of EPS in Japanese schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine or haloperidol were retrospectively compared as assessed by the DIEPSS to the prevalence and incidence of EPS in primarily Caucasian schizophrenic patients who were treated with olanzapine or haloperidol. Specifically, the prevalence and incidence of dyskinesia, akathisia and parkinsonism were compared between the Japanese trial and an international trial to examine if appropriate definitions using the DIEPSS can be derived assuming that a comparable prevalence and incidence of the syndromes would be observed when any differences in residual antipsychotic exposure at the initiation of study treatment were accounted for. For the incidence of all EPS syndromes, odds ratios were observed to be similar between the two studies, indicating that appropriate criteria for the clinical diagnosis of the EPS syndromes could be established based on the DIEPSS. This preliminary and retrospective work suggests that the DIEPSS can be used to operationally define the presence or absence, and make the clinical diagnosis, of specific EPS syndromes.", "outbound_citations": ["15018842", "10392410", "11841075", "11442893", "10560896", "9090331", "8683905", "7751421", "2782476", "2574607", "3379143", "6591221", "6115586", "4917967", "13655060"], "inbound_citations": ["35133884", "36601351", "34740708", "34612724", "34342746", "34429604", "33890388", "33321381", "32827348", "32580668", "31471246", "31883082", "31532276", "30610009", "30950208", "29660207", "29774635", "29409162", "28750151", "26913177"], "label": "0"}

Efficacy was assessed throughout the study by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia, and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Safety assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Ratinf Scale (ESRS) UKU Side Effect Rating Scale, vital signs, body weight, ECG and laboratory screening.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRisperidone had a bell-shaped dose-response curve, with optimal therapeutic responses occurring at a daily dose of 8 mg. The therapeutic response to haloperidol was similar to that seen with risperidone 16 mg. Risperidone was associated with significantly less extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol, as assessed by the ESRS. The effect was mirrored by the requirement for antiparkinson rescue medication. Furthermore, the overall incidence of adverse events was markedly lower with the optimum dose of risperidone than with haloperidol.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRisperidone is at least as effective as haloperidol for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia. Moreover, risperidone is associated with an improved adverse event profile and significantly less extrapyramidal symptoms which will have beneficial implications on patient quality of life and compliance. These results are in agreement with the results from the international multicenter trial.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["27977041"], "label": "0"}

Methods: In this 9-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 21-center clinical trial, patients were randomized to receive fixed daily doses of modafinil 200 mg, modafinil 400 mg, or placebo. A placebo-controlled, 2-week treatment discontinuation phase was included to evaluate the effects of withdrawal on patients who had been receiving modafinil. A total of 271 patients who were nai\u0308ve to modafinil received study medication in the 9-week trial and 240 patients received study medication in the discontinuation phase. Results: Treatment with modafinil resulted in significant improvement in two objective measures of EDS: the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test. Additionally, patient self-assessment of sleepiness was significantly improved, as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and level of illness was significantly reduced on the independent clinician assessment, the Clinical Global Impression of Change. Nighttime sleep, monitored by nocturnal polysomnography, was not adversely effected with modafinil treatment compared with placebo treatment. The most frequent adverse experience was headache, which was not significantly greater for modafinil than placebo. During treatment discontinuation, individuals who had been receiving modafinil experienced a return of their EDS to baseline levels. During treatment discontinuation, patients did not experience symptoms associated with amphetamine withdrawal syndrome. For up to 9 weeks of daily use there was no evidence for the development of dependence at the dose levels studied. Conclusion: The data indicate that modafinil has an excellent safety profile and is very well tolerated. Modafinil is an effective treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy and shows continued efficacy with up to 9 weeks of daily use.", "outbound_citations": ["10757254", "10481905", "10458611", "10481909", "10364220", "10214764", "9507929", "9450772", "9402886", "9270575", "9440113", "8943072", "8998404", "7701202", "7701206", "7991954", "7973321", "8341891", "1359924", "1798888", "2574313", "3809866", "6177511", "72649", "5396122", "13566389"], "inbound_citations": ["37082610", "36872499", "36362535", "35150243", "34545626", "34173695", "34121988", "34743790", "33631500", "33886090", "32699548", "32386693", "31926465", "31640875", "31691827", "31713736", "31608404", "32032921", "31290083", "31215815", "30694576", "30503715", "30416836", "30239930", "30174215", "29891587", "29047171", "28778242", "29221779", "28619176", "28443381", "28416274", "28105576", "27865546", "27842553", "27938918", "27655462", "27542882", "27549768", "27166238", "27155860", "26541241", "26972036", "26909768", "27830625", "27911338", "26298786"], "label": "0"}

Sixty-two patients (29 depressed type; 33 bipolar type) entered a three-site, randomized, double-blind, 6-week trial of risperidone (up to 10 mg/day) or haloperidol (up to 20 mg/day). Trained raters assessed baseline, weekly, and end-of-study levels of psychopathology with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-24) and the Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania (CARS-M). The authors were unable to statistically distinguish between risperidone and haloperidol in the amelioration of psychotic and manic symptoms. In addition, there was no difference in worsening of mania between the two agents in either subgroup (i.e., depressed or bipolar subgroups). For the total PANSS, risperidone produced a mean decrease of 16 points from baseline compared with a 14-point decrease with haloperidol. For the total CARS-M scale, risperidone and haloperidol produced mean change scores of 5 and 8 points, respectively, and for the CARS-M Mania subscale, 3 and 7 points, respectively. Additionally, risperidone produced a mean decrease of 13 points from the baseline 24-item HAM-D, compared with an 8-point decrease with haloperidol. In those patients who had more severe depressive symptoms (i.e., HAM-D baseline score >20), risperidone produced at least a 50% mean improvement in 12 (75%) of 16 patients in comparison to 8 (38%) of 21 patients receiving haloperidol. Haloperidol produced significantly more extrapyramidal side effects and resulted in more dropouts caused by any side effect. There was no difference between risperidone and haloperidol in reducing both psychotic and manic symptoms in this group of patients with schizoaffective disorder. Risperidone did not demonstrate a propensity to precipitate mania and was better tolerated than haloperidol. In those subjects with higher baseline HAM-D scores (i.e., >20), risperidone produced a greater improvement in depressive symptoms than haloperidol.", "outbound_citations": ["10450252", "10190221", "9646878", "9555596", "9448657", "8927675", "20157641", "7520110", "7948445", "8071290", "7514366", "8024673", "8328561", "7694306", "7683702", "1384075", "1637253", "1938976", "2450200", "3101647", "3616518", "4917967", "14399272"], "inbound_citations": ["34270506", "34400122", "31303314"], "label": "0"}

A systematic review of the available literature identified 7 studies (N = 193 subjects) of psychostimulants and 10 studies of nonstimulant medications (N = 167 subjects) including antidepressants, antihypertensives, and amino acids for the treatment of ADHD in adults. The majority of double-blind investigations were with the psychostimulants, with the nonstimulant agents, generally antidepressants, studied under open conditions. There was considerable variability in diagnostic criteria, dosing parameters, and response rates between the various studies. Under controlled conditions, the aggregate literature shows that the stimulants had a clinically and statistically significant effect on reducing ADHD symptoms. Open studies on the nonserotonergic antidepressants (tricyclics, bupropion, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) also show a moderate anti-ADHD effect. The literature appears to support the use of robust doses of both stimulants and antidepressants for ADHD in adults.

DesignObservational study. SettingAll methadone maintenance and 21-day methadone detoxification programs in San Francisco. ParticipantsA total of 2351 heterosexual IVDU, of whom 681 were seronegative at first visit and seen at least twice (\u2018repeaters\u2019). Main outcome measuresHIV seroconversion rates, risk factors for seroconversion, and changes in behavior. ResultsThe HIV seroconversion rate in repeaters was 1.9% per person-year (ppy) of follow-up |2.1% in women versus 1.7% in men (not significant); 4% in African Americans versus 1% in whites (P=0.006); 3.9% ppy in the first third of the study, 1.2% in the second (P= 0.007), and 1.9% in the last (not significant)]. Risk factors for seroconversion were five or more sexual partners per year [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.6; P=0.02], use of shooting gallery ever (HR = 2.9; P=0.02), and less than 1 year (lifetime) in methadone maintenance (HR = 2.7; P=0.02). Self-reported intravenous cocaine use fell from 33 to 15% over 5 years, shooting gallery use fell from 19 to 6%, and the proportion with five or more sexual partners fell from 25 to 10%. Bleach use rose to 75% of needle-sharers. ConclusionsThe 1985\u20131990 HIV seroconversion rate in IVDU (1.9% ppy) was comparable to that in San Francisco cohorts of homosexual men (1.4% ppy). A decline in HIV seroconversion coincided with changes in risk behavior. Stable attendance of methadone maintenance was highly protective: the seroconversion rate in subjects with 1 year or more in methadone was 12% ppy.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["30735511", "29153491"], "label": "0"}

The clinical status was evaluated before, during, and at the end of 10 weeks of sulpiride addition using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Results The clozapine\u2013sulpiride group exhibited substantially greater and significant improvements in positive and negative psychotic symptoms.

Methods: Ten patients with PD and LID took part in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover trial. Patients received a 2-week course of olanzapine or placebo in each treatment phase with 1-week washout in between. Dyskinesias were assessed at baseline and after each treatment period with an acute dopaminergic challenge and unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) questionnaires. Patients also kept on/off and dyskinesia diaries for the last 3 days prior to each assessment. Results: There was a 41% difference in dyskinesia reduction on olanzapine compared to placebo, as measured by objective dyskinesia rating scales (mean percentage reduction abnormal involuntary movement score: 30% versus \u221211.2%, p < 0.02). Similar differences were demonstrated by patient diaries (mean reduction: 46% versus \u22122%, p < 0.02) and UPDRS items 32 and 33.

Rapid detoxification with opiate antagonists (Group B) induced slight and transient withdrawal symptoms, and resulted in a significantly lower percentage of heroin catabolites in urine controls during the detoxification procedure, lower negative and positive craving, less mood problems, and higher compliance in extended naltrexone treatment.

Fifty-two additional patients served as controls. Anesthetic technique consisted of balanced anesthesia (isoflurane, fentanyl, atracurium). ECG, invasive arterial blood pressure (BP), expiratory PCO2 and pulse oximetry were continuously recorded. Hemodynamic events (HEs) were defined as moderate for a 20% reduction of the baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) or a heart rate (HR) decreasing between 50 beats per minute (bpm) and 40 bpm. A 30% reduction of the baseline SBP or a HR below 40 bpm was considered an important HE. The rate and duration of these events were recorded from induction to recovery. HEs requiring a specific treatment were noted. Central venous pressure, volume of fluid infused, and urinary output were also recorded. 21% of control patients and 31% of clonidine patients had no adverse HEs. A moderate reduction of the baseline BP was the most common episode in both groups. The incidence of the HEs (moderate and important) was similar in both groups but the duration HEs was significantly longer in the clonidine patients (p < 0.05). 40% of the control patients and 13% of the clonidine patients required specific management for their HEs (p < 0.05), the most common of which was hypotension without bradycardia.

After a single-blind washout period of 4 to 7 days, patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four fixed doses of the new antipsychotic, ziprasidone 4 (N = 19), 10 (N = 17), 40 (N = 17), or 160 (N = 20) mg/day or haloperidol 15 mg/day (N = 17) for 4 weeks. A dose-response relationship among ziprasidone groups was established for improvements in Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) score (p = 0.002) but not in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score (p = 0.08). The intent-to-treat analysis of mean changes from baseline in the BPRS total, BPRS Psychosis core, and CGI-S scores demonstrated that ziprasidone 160 mg/day was comparable with haloperidol in reducing overall psychopathology and positive symptoms and was superior to ziprasidone 4 mg/day. Despite the small sample size and short duration of the trial, the improvement in CGI-S with both ziprasidone 160 mg/day and haloperidol 15 mg/day was statistically significantly greater than with ziprasidone 4 mg/day (p = 0.001 andp = 0.005, respectively). The percentage of patients classified as responders on both the BPRS total (> or = 30% improvement) and CGI-Improvement (score of 1 or 2) scales in the ziprasidone 160 mg/day group was similar to that in the haloperidol group and nonsignificantly greater than that in the ziprasidone 4 mg/day group. On all assessments of clinical efficacy, the improvements associated with ziprasidone 4 mg/day, 10 mg/day, and 40 mg/day were similar. Concomitant benztropine use at any time during the study was less frequent with ziprasidone 160 mg/day (15%) than with haloperidol (53%). Haloperidol was associated with a sustained hyperprolactinemia, unlike ziprasidone, where only transient elevations in prolactin that returned to normal within the dosing interval were observed. Ziprasidone was well tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events was similar in all groups. The results of this study suggest that ziprasidone 160 mg/day is as effective as haloperidol 15 mg/day in reducing overall psychopathology and positive symptoms of an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder but has a lower potential to induce extrapyramidal symptoms.", "outbound_citations": ["7562537", "7683702", "2125564", "2141636", "2571717", "2567348", "2892477", "2872945", "6105793"], "inbound_citations": ["34390232", "32415847", "31303314", "29915922", "29382960", "26780598"], "label": "0"}

The primary efficacy analysis involved the mean change from baseline to endpoint in total scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Secondary analyses included comparisons of the mean change in positive and negative symptoms, comorbid depression, extrapyramidal symptoms, and overall drug safety.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOlanzapine demonstrated clinical results superior to those of haloperidol on overall improvement according to the BPRS and on every secondary measure, including depression. Olanzapine was also associated with significantly fewer discontinuations of treatment due to lack of drug efficacy or adverse events. Substantially more olanzapine-treated patients (66.5%) than haloperidol-treated patients (46.8%) completed 6 weeks of therapy.

We performed a prospective randomized double-blinded study to determine the efficacy and adverse effects of clonidine mixed with a long-acting local anesthetic on postoperative analgesia. Sixty adult patients underwent elective rotator cuff repair using interscalene brachial plexus block combined with general anesthesia and were randomly divided into one of the following three groups. Placebo (n = 20): interscalene block with 40 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine (1/200000) and 1 mL of 0.9% saline, completed by 1 mL of 0.9% saline IM in the controlateral shoulder; Control (n = 20): interscalene block with 40 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine and 1 mL of 0.9% saline, completed by 150 &mgr;g (=1 mL) of clonidine IM; Clonidine (n = 20): interscalene block with 40 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine and 150 &mgr;g (=1 mL) of clonidine, completed by 1 mL of 0.9% saline IM. During anesthesia hemodynamic variables and fractional expired isoflurane concentration (FeISO) were recorded. The following postoperative variables were assessed: duration of interscalene block, quality of pain relief on a visual analog scale, side effects, and consumption of morphine with a patient-controlled analgesia device over 48 h. Patient characteristics were comparable. During anesthesia mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and FeISO were significantly decreased in Clonidine and Control groups compared with Placebo group. Duration of analgesia, defined as the time elapsed from interscalene injection to the first morphine request, was 983 \u00b1 489 min in the Placebo, 909 \u00b1 160 min in the Control, and 829 \u00b1 159 min in the Clonidine groups. Pain scores and consumption of morphine at 24 h and 48 h showed no differences among the three groups. We conclude that adding 150 &mgr;g of clonidine in interscalene block does not prolong analgesia induced by 40 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine, but decreases mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate. IMPLICATIONS Clonidine in brachial plexus block does not improve postoperative analgesia when mixed with a long-lasting anesthetic. Nevertheless, with or without clonidine, bupivacaine in interscalene block provides a long-lasting analgesia of approximately 15 h.", "outbound_citations": ["10320179", "9924240", "9286891", "8895283", "8853097", "7573998", "7669462", "8309984", "8093828", "8439023", "1416011", "1616165", "1567041", "1606097", "1742820", "3591249", "14156576"], "inbound_citations": ["36447922", "35162346", "34575180", "34103826", "33128801", "34349335", "33850823", "32962199", "32844751", "32000536", "31888322", "31599763", "31070463", "29619786", "29191649", "28880902", "28625576", "27761415", "26908974", "25603389", "26330717", "25933958", "25656375", "25806906"], "label": "0"}

Two studies were conducted to test this prediction, and to evaluate the effects of interval duration, distraction, and stimulant medication on the reproductions of temporal durations in children with ADHD. Study I: 12 ADHD children and 26 controls (ages 6\u201314 years) were tested using a time reproduction task in which subjects had to reproduce intervals of 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 s. Four trials at each duration were presented with a distraction occurring on half of these trials. Control subjects were significantly more accurate than ADHD children at most durations and were unaffected by the distraction. ADHD children, in contrast, were significantly less accurate when distracted. Both groups became less accurate with increasing durations to be reproduced. Study II: Tested three doses of methylphenidate (MPH) and placebo on the time reproductions of the 12 ADHD children. ADHD children became less accurate with increasing durations and distraction was found to reduce accuracy at 36 s or less. No effects of MPH were evident. The results of these preliminary studies seem to support the prediction that sense of time is impaired in children with ADHD. The capacity to accurately reproduce time intervals in ADHD children does not seem to improve with administration of stimulant medication.

An earlier case-control study found that prior use of antidepressants or benzodiazepine tranquilizers was associated with a 2-fold increase in risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. However, that study lacked details on all types of psychotropic medications, length of use, and the categorization of the specific action of these medications on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. In a new case-control study conducted in eastern Massachusetts (MA) and all of New Hampshire (NH), we identified all women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer between May 1992 and March 1997. We interviewed 563 women diagnosed with malignant or borderline epithelial ovarian tumors and 523 controls identified through random digit dialing and the use of Town Books (residential listings by name, age, and precinct). Participants were asked to provide the name of medications used for 6 months or longer, the age at first use, and total months or years of use. Psychotropic medications included amphetamines, sedatives, barbiturates/anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. Self-reported use of psychotropic medication for 6 months or longer was associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of invasive ovarian cancer [odds ratio (OR), 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.3]. Relative to nonusers, risk was greatest in those whose first use occurred premenopausally for more than 2 years (OR, 2.9; CI, 1.3-6.6). The association was largely confined to use of medications that operate through dopaminergic mechanisms (OR, 2.9; CI, 1.3-6.4) or gabaergic pathways (OR, 1.5; CI, 0.9-2.5) as opposed to serotoninergic pathways (OR, 1.0; CI, 0.4-2.1). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that psychotropic medications induce gonadotropin secretion, which in turn may increase ovarian cancer risk. However, until other studies confirm our findings and determine whether they apply to medications with specific neuroendocrine actions, it is premature to advise a change in clinical practice and conclude that these medications indeed play a role in the etiology of ovarian cancer.", "outbound_citations": ["8989119", "8863061", "8738578", "8602220", "7771455", "7841851", "1349346", "1682833", "1832377", "1671361", "1814800", "1901539", "2107654", "1983168", "2999381", "6578367", "6373207", "4104488"], "inbound_citations": ["36394636", "36425551", "35444540", "35457423", "32110111", "30008384", "29292523", "29689697", "28791695", "27894012", "27442640", "27121207", "26840257"], "label": "0"}

To further elucidate the magnitude and impact of blood pressure and pulse elevations in patients taking atomoxetine. Short-term cardiovascular safety in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD was assessed in five randomised, double-blind trials (duration up to 10 weeks) with atomoxetine (n = 612) or placebo (n = 474). Long-term cardiovascular safety in children and adolescents (n = 169) was assessed in patients who entered an open-label extension or a blinded continuation following short-term treatment. Adverse events, blood pressure, sitting pulse, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected throughout the trials. QT intervals were corrected for heart rate by a data-specific correction factor (QTcD; derived from baseline ECGs) as well as standard methods. Atomoxetine treatment was associated with small but statistically significant increases in mean systolic blood pressure in adults and diastolic blood pressure in children and adolescents. Mean pulse rate increased for all atomoxetine treatment groups. The increases in blood pressure and pulse tended to occur early in therapy, stabilised, and returned toward baseline upon drug discontinuation. There was no significant difference between atomoxetine and placebo treatment groups in change in QTcD interval for all study populations. Palpitations in the adult patient population were the only significant cardiovascular adverse event (p = 0.037) occurring more frequently in the atomoxetine treatment group (3.7%) than in the placebo group (0.8%). Discontinuations due to cardiovascular-related events were very uncommon in the adult group, and did not occur in the child/adolescent group. While atomoxetine has noradrenergic activity, increases in pulse and blood pressure were small and of little, if any, clinical significance.

The expected morbidity and mortality from smoking-attributable diseases will continue to rise for the next 30 years. In order to reduce this negative impact on worldwide health, effective therapy to aid smoking cessation must be provided to current smokers. Treatment for tobacco dependence involves the combination of behavioural therapies and pharmacological treatment. The most common pharmacological treatments include nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine medications, including antidepressants. The antidepressant with the greatest weight of evidence for efficacy in the treatment of tobacco dependence is bupropion. Sustained-release bupropion is approved for the treatment of tobacco dependence in over 50 countries worldwide. The efficacy of bupropion for the treatment of tobacco dependence is attributed to the blockage of dopamine reuptake in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. This area of the brain is believed to mediate reward for nicotine use and for other drugs of dependence. Randomised, controlled clinical trials have shown that bupropion approximately doubles abstinence rates compared with placebo. In addition, long-term treatment with bupropion may reduce or delay smoking relapse. Bupropion also appears to be effective in the treatment of smokers who have recently relapsed and smokers with other comorbid psychiatric conditions. Bupropion has a good adverse events profile, but the risk exists for serious adverse effects such as seizures. Recent postmarketing surveillance reports have raised safety concerns about bupropion, although no causal relationship between bupropion and the reported serious adverse events or death has been established.", "outbound_citations": ["11988379", "11800252", "11796154", "11694208", "11560455", "11488359", "11406741", "11377644", "11403727", "11394732", "11348939", "11282701", "11199956", "11083883", "10991997", "10698811", "10684744", "11072438", "10663415", "10573271", "10053177", "10211174", "9778204", "9707377", "9414327", "9378846", "7864277", "7733862", "8201739", "7804386", "1845224", "1744061", "1900980", "3114333", "3487983", "6422449", "9337378"], "inbound_citations": ["32720976", "31143428", "27733658", "27890648"], "label": "0"}

In the present study, combined data from the two trials were analyzed.\n\n\nMETHOD\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive placebo, fixed doses of risperidone (2, 6, 10, and 16 mg/day) or 20 mg/day of haloperidol for 8 weeks. Factor analysis of scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) produced five dimensions (negative symptoms, positive symptoms, disorganized thought, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression), similar to the five dimensions of previous factor-analytic studies of PANSS data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean changes (symptom reductions) in PANSS factor scores from baseline to treatment Weeks 6 and 8 were significantly greater in patients receiving 6-16 mg/day of risperidone than in patients receiving placebo or haloperidol. The advantages of risperidone were greatest for negative symptoms, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression. Even at the lowest dose, 2 mg/day, risperidone was significantly (p < or = .05) superior to haloperidol in reducing negative symptoms. The differences in outcomes between risperidone and haloperidol on PANSS scores were not related to extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nRisperidone produced significantly (p < or = .05) greater improvements than haloperidol on all five dimensions. The large between-group differences on negative symptoms, hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression suggest that risperidone and other serotonin/dopamine antagonists have qualitatively different effects from those of conventional antipsychotic agents.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37032951", "36709614", "36528376", "36424289", "36526163", "36294806", "36294755", "36179110", "35985087", "35508529", "35417039", "35432047", "35352436", "35338567", "35276716", "35276079", "35219096", "35207735", "34838528", "36420692", "35069300", "35046851", "35012696", "34641986", "34265870", "34147931", "34091867", "34140772", "34058648", "33854317", "36324430", "33637748", "33626254", "33597064", "34377435", "33355966", "33291156", "35060906", "33289223", "33291657", "33223272", "33161955", "33096356", "33192706", "32893328", "32912978", "32982245", "32840872", "32631031", "32511941", "32462699", "32653578", "32438207", "33257954", "32043133", "32037127", "32729695", "31617873", "31788985", "31909750", "31688451", "31129143", "31563956", "31486890", "31749649", "31471576", "31456704", "31205187", "31108345", "30962688", "30836381", "30985829", "30822774", "30738380", "30172595", "30791343", "30470662", "30055853", "30499148", "30198163", "29370404", "31994511", "29569047", "30426252", "29935887", "29804925", "29420822", "29140501", "29883861", "29588126", "29966891", "29667181", "27621217", "30093698", "29774628", "30588364", "29924507", "29582518", "29764266", "29637739", "29482042", "29563800", "29366848", "29475381", "29415258", "28754408", "29094787", "29164930", "29108803", "28919128", "28981857", "28888358", "26218233", "29369669", "28623450", "28577223", "28899614", "29410940", "29410937", "29410941", "28814873", "28636694", "27230288", "28160505", "28133766", "28117049", "28625204", "28302501", "28383362", "27789188", "27940386", "28049079", "28185786", "28162014", "28255435", "27693281", "28138247", "26946382", "28096877", "27566723", "27440672", "27977041", "27811552", "27931900", "27617414", "27448523", "27451107", "27291830", "27328889", "27242068", "27668551", "27423634", "27117676", "27431493", "27157799", "26884546", "27151073", "27251417", "27094189", "26980460", "26913177", "26869182", "26607102", "26813484", "26730193"], "label": "0"}

After a 3-7 day-placebo washout period, there was a 4-week, double-blind, fixed-dose comparison trial that was followed by a 4-week, flexible-dose phase. Measures of clinical change were quantified by standard psychopathologic and neuromotor instruments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRisperidone demonstrated clinical efficacy superior to that of haloperidol on the total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) after the first 4 weeks of treatment. Risperidone did not show any advantage over haloperidol after an additional 4 weeks. Overall improvement on the BPRS at 4 weeks was significantly better for the risperidone group (24%) than for the haloperidol group (11%). Risperidone-treated subjects were significantly less likely than haloperidol-treated subjects to require concomitant anticholinergic medication after 4 weeks (20% versus 63%); they also had significantly les observable akathisia (24% versus 53%) and significantly less severe tardive dyskinesia. Baseline characteristics that correlated significantly with risperidone response were positive symptoms, conceptual disorganization, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRisperidone was better tolerated and more effective in a subset of patients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia. Positive psychotic symptoms and extrapyramidal side effects at baseline appear to be powerful predictors of subsequent response to risperidone.", "outbound_citations": ["9545995", "7514366", "1375801", "1701262", "2378546", "2484825", "2574607", "3046553", "2450200", "6437365", "4917967"], "inbound_citations": ["29409162", "29749607", "27977041", "27648956"], "label": "0"}

We examined the effectiveness of treatment with clozapine on negative symptoms in a cohort of patients with minimal positive symptoms. Improvements in positive and negative symptoms were measured by BPRS ratings in a subgroup of schizophrenic patients (n=17, from a state hospital cohort of 75) with minimal positive symptoms, who had received clozapine for 6 months. In this subgroup, significant improvements were noted by a composite score on the three negative symptom items of emotional withdrawal, blunted affect, and motor retardation. Positive and depressive symptoms remained unchanged. The remaining cohort (n=58) showed improvements in overall psychopathology including positive, negative, and depressive symptoms. Interestingly, nearly 50% of each group were discharged from the hospital.

To meet these aims, the following tasks were selected: two versions of the Stop Paradigm for inhibition of a prepotent response, a Circle Tracing Task and a recently developed Follow Task for inhibition of an ongoing response, and the Stroop Color-Word Test and an Eriksen Flanker Task for interference control. These tasks were administered to 23 boys with AD/HD during four treatment conditions: 5 mg MPH, 10 mg MPH, 20 mg MPH, and placebo.

D-methamphetamine dose-dependently increased all vital signs (systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, and pulse rate) parameters. Isradipine significantly reduced d-methamphetamine-induced increases in diastolic and mean arterial pressure; however, this potentially beneficial therapeutic effect was offset by a significant reflex rise in pulse rate. D-methamphetamine also improved attention, accuracy of reasoning ability, and performance on computerized cognitive function tasks. D-methamphetamine's cognitive improving effects were not altered significantly by isradipine.

Follow-up visits occurred every 2 weeks for safety monitoring and dose adjustment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-four medication-free subjects (31 boys and three girls with a mean age of 10.4 years) with ADHD, combined type, and a tic disorder participated. After 8 weeks of treatment, guanfacine was associated with a mean improvement of 37% in the total score on the teacher-rated ADHD Rating Scale, compared to 8% improvement for placebo. Nine of 17 subjects who received guanfacine were blindly rated on the Clinical Global Improvement scale as either much improved or very much improved, compared with none of 17 subjects who received placebo. The mean score on the parent-rated hyperactivity index improved by 27% in the guanfacine group and 21% in the placebo group, not a significant difference.

Patients were allocated randomly to receive either placebo (n = 31) or clonidine (n = 30). The treatment group received premedication with a trans-dermal clonidine system (0.2 mg/d) the night prior to surgery, which was left in place for 72 h, and 0.3 mg oral clonidine 60\u201390 min before surgery. Clonidine reduced enflurane requirements, intraoperative tachycardia, and myocardial ischemia (1/28 clonidine patients vs 5/24 placebo, P = 0.05). However, clonidine decreased heart rates only during the first five postoperative hours; the incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia (6/28 clonidine vs 5/26 placebo) did not differ between the two groups. Patients who experienced postoperative myocardial ischemia tended to have higher heart rates after surgery. Clonidine significantly reduced the plasma levels of epinephrine (P = 0.009) and norepinephrine (P = 0.026) measured on the first postoperative morning. There were no differences in the need for intravenous fluid therapy or antihypertensive therapy after surgery. The number of hours spent in an intensive care setting and the number of days spent in hospital were not different between the two groups. These results suggest that larger doses of clonidine should be investigated for their ability to decrease postoperative tachycardia and myocardial ischemia.

Double blind, placebo-controlled study. Operating room and surgical intensive care unit of a university medical center. 54 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Patients received approximately 5 micrograms/kg of oral clonidine or a placebo together with 40 micrograms/kg lorazepam 90 minutes prior to titrated sufentanil induction of anesthesia. Thirty minutes prior to cardiopulmonary bypass, a second dose of either approximately 5 micrograms/kg clonidine or placebo was given as a slurry via a nasogastric tube. Opioid use, hemodynamic effects, hormonal responses, and recovery effects were recorded. Values for ten hemodynamic variables were compiled on the evening prior to surgery, prior to induction, and during seven additional events and compared. Catecholamines and beta-endorphins were measured prior to induction, after intubation, and after sternotomy. The amount of sufentanil used for induction, maintenance, and total opioid were compared. The times to awakening and response to verbal commands were compared. The two groups exhibited similar patient demographics, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and duration of surgery. Patients receiving clonidine required significantly (p < 0.04) less sufentanil for induction (clonidine: 2.19 +/- 0.95 micrograms/kg vs. placebo: 2.93 +/- 1.07 micrograms/kg) and total amount of sufentanil (clonidine: 9.1 +/- 3.9 micrograms/kg vs. placebo: 11.7 +/- 4.6 micrograms/kg). Patients receiving clonidine required significantly (p < 0.01) less isoflurane (9.7 +/- 6.8 MAC min vs. 19.7 +/- 9.9 MAC min) to maintain heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to within 15% of baseline without significant differences in other vasoactive drugs. Catecholamine concentrations were significantly (p < 0.02) lower in patients receiving clonidine without any difference in beta-endorphin concentrations. Patients receiving clonidine had significantly (p < 0.02) lower HR, systolic arterial pressure, MAP, and systemic vascular resistance prior to induction than patients receiving placebo without differences in other hemodynamic variables.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the PHARMO-database, containing filled prescriptions of 450 000 community-dwelling people in the Netherlands from 1986 through 1999. We defined cohorts of first-time users of haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine aged 15 to 54 years. In the first 90 days of treatment, we assessed the occurrence of EPS, defined as first use of any antiparkinsonian agent. We estimated relative risks of EPS for risperidone and olanzapine versus haloperidol using a Cox proportional hazards model. Patients were subdivided according to prior use of antipsychotic and antiparkinsonian drugs. RESULTS: We identified 424 patients starting treatment with haloperidol, 243 with risperidone, and 181 with olanzapine. Prior use of antipsychotic plus antiparkinsonian medication was significantly more frequent among users of risperidone and olanzapine than in those using haloperidol (36.2%, 40.3%, and 4.5%, respectively; p < 0.001). Within most subgroups of comparable treatment history, patients using risperidone and olanzapine showed reduced risks of EPS compared with haloperidol, although some of these findings did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.03\u20130.22). However, this was not observed for patients using risperidone who had experienced EPS in the past (RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.24 to 7.18). CONCLUSIONS: In general, we observed reduced risks of EPS for risperidone and olanzapine compared with haloperidol within subgroups of patients with a similar treatment history. However, the added value of risperidone in patients who have experienced EPS in the past needs further study.", "outbound_citations": ["11229973", "11549212", "11120421", "11099280", "10847307", "10751282", "10676829", "10796543", "10084417", "9989565", "9766616", "9771827", "9201802", "9088885", "9447497", "8599393", "7654115", "7739305", "7531764", "8064562", "7513599", "8102973", "1352677", "1350072", "1674882", "1670616", "2571717", "6104342", "4150951"], "inbound_citations": ["36290593", "29745723", "27297785"], "label": "0"}

After an inpatient period of up to 21 days, subjects were followed as outpatients. Dose adjustment was permitted during the inpatient period. Efficacy was assessed using change from baseline in Mania Rating Scale (MRS) score to day 21; other efficacy measures included the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Clinical Global Impressions-Part I, Severity of Illness scale. The primary safety endpoint was change from baseline in weight. Other safety and tolerability endpoints included spontaneous adverse event reporting and changes from baseline in laboratory measures and vital signs.\n\n\nRESULTS\n120 subjects (N = 63 divalproex, N = 57 olanzapine) were randomly assigned to treatment. No significant differences between groups were found for any efficacy variable for change from baseline to day 21. Mean MRS score changes from baseline to day 21 were -14.8 for divalproex and -17.2 for olanzapine (p =.210). A significantly (p <.05) greater proportion of olanzapine-treated subjects experienced somnolence, weight gain, edema, rhinitis, and speech disorder (slurred speech); no adverse events were significantly greater in the divalproex group. A number of laboratory measures also demonstrated significant treatment differences, but the clinical significance of many of these is uncertain. Mean body weight changes were significantly greater in the olanzapine group (+ 8.8 lb [+ 4.0 kg]) than the divalproex group (+ 5.5 lb [+ 2.5 kg], p <.050). One death occurred during the study (olanzapine group, diabetic ketoacidosis).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNo significant difference in efficacy was found between treatment groups.

Subjects were inpatients diagnosed with acute mania associated with bipolar I disorder (DSM-III-R or -IV and SADS-Change Version). Patients were administered oral-loaded divalproex (20 or 30 mg/kg/day on days 1 and 2 followed by 20 mg/kg/day, and increased at physician's discretion), standard-titration divalproex initiated at 250 mg t.i.d. and titrated to 40-150 microg/mL, lithium (300 mg t.i.d. initial dose) titrated to 0.4 to 1.5 mEq/L, olanzapine (10 mg q.d. initial dose) up to 20 mg/day, or placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results demonstrate an early efficacy advantage for oral-loaded divalproex compared to standard-titration divalproex at days 5, 7/8, and 10. Efficacy was improved over lithium on day 7/8. There were no efficacy differences between divalproex loading and olanzapine.

We then studied whether clonidine might modulate the hemodynamic changes induced by PNO by reducing release of catecholamines and vasopressin. Both mechanical and neurohumoral factors contribute to the hemodynamic changes induced by carbon dioxide PNO. Several mediators have been proposed, but no study has correlated hemodynamic changes with changes in levels of these potential mediators. We conducted two studies, each including 20 healthy patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In the first study serial measurements of hemodynamics (thermodilution technique) were done during laparoscopy and after exsufflation. Plasma concentrations of cortisol, catecholamines, vasopressin, renin, endothelin and prostaglandins were measured at the same time points. In the second study patients were randomly allocated to receive 8 microg/kg clonidine infused over 1 h or placebo before PNO. Hemodynamics and plasma levels of cortisol, catecholamines and vasopressin were measured during PNO and after exsufflation. Peritoneal insufflation resulted in a significant reduction of cardiac output (18+/-4%) and increases in mean arterial pressure (39+/-8%) and systemic (70+/-12%) and pulmonary (98+/-18%) vascular resistances. Laparoscopy resulted in progressive and significant increases in plasma concentrations of cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine and renin. Vasopressin plasma concentrations markedly increased immediately after the beginning of PNO (before PNO 6+/-4 pg/ml; during PNO 129+/-42 pg/ml; p < 0.05). The profile of vasopressin release paralleled the time course of changes in systemic vascular resistance. Prostaglandins and endothelin did not change significantly. Clonidine significantly reduced mean arterial pressure, heart rate and the increase in systemic vascular resistance. Clonidine also significantly reduced catecholamine concentrations but did not alter vasopressin and cortisol plasma concentrations. Vasopressin and catecholamines probably mediate the increase in systemic vascular resistance observed during PNO.

At the end of the 8-week maintenance phase the mean seated diastolic blood pressure remained <90 mm Hg in the clonidine cohort but not in the terazosin cohort, yet the difference was not statistically significant. There was a significantly better response to clonidine when all patients who received treatment were considered. No adverse first-dose effects were experienced with terazosin. One patient who received transdermal clonidine developed contact dermatitis and withdrew from the study prematurely. The most common side effects associated with clonidine were dry mouth and fatigue while those associated with terazosin were headache and fatigue. Compliance was excellent in both groups.

Marijuana smokers (n=10) were maintained outpatient on active (300 mg/day) or placebo (0 mg/day) bupropion for 11 days, and were then maintained inpatient on the same bupropion dose for 17 days. For the first 4 inpatient days, participants smoked active marijuana [2.8% delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)] 5 times/day. For the remaining inpatient days, participants smoked placebo marijuana (0.0% THC) 5 times/day. Participants were then maintained outpatient on the alternate dose of bupropion for 11 days, followed by a second inpatient residential stay, paralleling the first. Medication administration was double-blind. Mood, psychomotor task performance, food intake, and sleep were measured daily during each inpatient phase. The order of active and placebo bupropion maintenance was counterbalanced between groups. Bupropion had few behavioral effects when participants smoked active marijuana. During placebo marijuana smoking, i.e., active marijuana withdrawal, ratings of irritability, restlessness, depression, and trouble sleeping were increased by bupropion compared to placebo maintenance.

Results: Studies with stimulants and antidepressants demonstrated significant short-term improvement in ADHD symptoms compared to placebo in adults. Methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamine had an immediate onset of action whereas the ADHD response to pemoline and antidepressants appeared delayed. The response to amphetamine and MPH appears to be dose-dependent. Controlled data on nicotonic and noradrenergic compounds appear promising.

This study investigated the inhibitory potential of MAO\u2010B and the pharmacokinetics of desmethylselegiline in humans. A double\u2010blind, crossover trial was performed to compare the effects of a single dose (10 mg) of selegiline or desmethylselegiline on MAO\u2010B platelet activity. The urinary excretion of phenylethylamine, which is considered to be a parameter of MAO\u2010B inhibition, also was measured. The concentrations of selegiline, desmethylselegiline, and their metabolites were measured in plasma after administration of the two compounds. Ten healthy volunteers participated in the study. There was a clear inhibition of platelet MAO\u2010B by both compounds. Desmethylselegiline caused a 63.7 \u00b1 12.7% inhibition of platelet MAO\u2010B compared with 96.4 \u00b1 3.9% caused by selegiline. The maximal inhibition by desmethylselegiline was reached significantly later after desmethylselegiline (time to reach maximal inhibition [tmax], 27 \u00b1 20 hours) than after selegiline administration (tmax, 1.4 \u00b1 1.4 hours). The platelet MAO\u2010B activity returned to baseline levels within 2 weeks, thus reflecting the irreversible nature of the inhibition by both compounds. The cumulative 48\u2010hour excretion of phenylethylamine was 33% lower after desmethylselegiline than after selegiline administration. All three major metabolites of selegiline could be detected in plasma after selegiline administration. Levoamphetamine was the only metabolite of desmethylselegiline. The area under the concentration\u2014time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0\u201324) of desmethylselegiline was 33 times higher than that of selegiline, suggesting a better bioavailability of desmethylselegiline.

To compare ziprasidone IM 2 mg (n=38) and 20 mg (n=41) in the acute control and short-term management of agitated psychotic patients. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, 24-h study assessed efficacy using the Behavioral Activity Rating Scale (BARS) and the PANSS.

Following the initial dose, three more doses could be given 4 h apart if needed during the 24-h period. The mean BARS score had decreased 15 min after the first 20 mg IM dose and was statistically significantly lower than the 2 mg group at 30 min post-dose. The improvement with the 20 mg dose increased until 2 h, and was maintained until at least 4 h post-dose (P<0.001). Two hours after the first injection, almost all of the patients receiving ziprasidone 20 mg were BARS responders compared with just one-third of those receiving 2 mg ziprasidone (P<0.001). The calming effect of ziprasidone was also evident by the significant reduction in PANSS agitation items (P<0.05) and CGI-severity at 4 h (P=0.008). Both ziprasidone doses were very well tolerated. Ziprasidone IM 20 mg was not associated with EPS, dystonia, akathisia, respiratory depression or with excessive sedation.

Sixty patients were divided into three groups of 20. During a 48-h period, they received, via an interscalene catheter, a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine with sufentanil 0.1 microg/mL and clonidine 1 microg/mL at 10 mL /h in Group 1; a continuous infusion of the same solution at 5 mL/h plus PCA boluses (2.5 mL/30 min) in Group 2; and only PCA boluses (5 mL/30 min) of the same solution in Group 3. Pain scores, sensory block, supplemental analgesia, bupivacaine consumption, side effects, and satisfaction scores were recorded. At 24 and 48 h, sensory block was more frequent and pain control was significantly better in Groups 1 and 2 than in Group 3 (P < 0.001). In Group 3, larger doses of paracetamol were required. Bupivacaine consumption was significantly less in Groups 2 and 3 than in Group 1 (P < 0.001). Satisfaction was significantly higher in Groups 1 and 2 than in Group 3 (P < 0.01). Side effects were comparable in the three groups. We conclude that continuous interscalene analgesia requires a background infusion after open shoulder surgery. Because it reduces the local anesthetic consumption and allows the patients to rapidly reinforce the block shortly before physiotherapy, a basal infusion rate of 5 mL/h combined with PCA boluses (2.5 mL/ 30 min) is the recommended technique.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nIn this study, we demonstrated that continuous interscalene analgesia requires a background infusion to provide efficient pain relief after open shoulder surgery.

The first study was a component of a double-blind efficacy trial wherein 57 patients were first tested in a human laboratory for their initial responsiveness to medication. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or methylphenidate treatment and received their first dose in the human laboratory environment before continuing in outpatient treatment. Methylphenidate was given as a 20-mg sustained-release dose (twice daily) plus an additional 5-mg immediate-release dose combined with the morning dose. Methylphenidate increased heart rate and subjective ratings; however, the subjective effects were primarily of a \"dysphoric\" nature, and significant effects were limited to increases in anxiety, depression, and anger on the Profile of Mood States; shaky/jittery ratings on a visual analog scale; and dysphoria on the lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) scale of the Addiction Research Center Inventory. Methylphenidate did not increase cocaine craving nor ratings suggesting abuse potential (i.e., Morphine-Benzedrine Group or drug-liking scores, etc.). None of the drug effects observed in the human laboratory was of clinical concern, and no subject was precluded from continuing in the outpatient study. After outpatient treatment completion, 12 patients were brought back into a second double-blind human laboratory study in which three doses (15, 30, and 60 mg) of immediate-release methylphenidate were administered in an ascending series preceded and followed by placebo. Methylphenidate produced dose-related increases in heart rate, subjective ratings of shaky/jittery, and LSD/dysphoria without significantly altering cocaine craving or stimulant euphoria ratings. These results suggest that stimulant substitution-type approaches to the treatment of cocaine dependence are not necessarily contraindicated because of cardiovascular toxicity or medication abuse potential. However, they also suggest that the subjective effects of methylphenidate may not be positive enough for an adequate replacement approach.", "outbound_citations": ["9408812", "9298515", "9218279", "9126740", "8745134", "8556974", "7771915", "7635993", "7771919", "7771912", "8635177", "11224277", "11224186", "8456040", "1837556", "1786492", "1679387", "2529365", "2682679", "2820058", "3332559", "4091158", "6691514", "6536756", "5554941"], "inbound_citations": ["36421870"], "label": "0"}

At 2 hours after the first injection, patients treated with olanzapine showed a significantly greater reduction in scores on all agitation scales compared with patients treated with either placebo or lorazepam. At 24 hours after the first injection, olanzapine remained statistically superior to placebo in reducing agitation in patients with acute mania, whereas patients treated with lorazepam were not significantly different from those treated with placebo or olanzapine. Furthermore, no significant differences among the three treatment groups were observed in safety measures, including treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms, the incidence of acute dystonia, or QTc interval changes.

This flexible-dose study examined efficacy and safety in a randomized, double-blind, 52-week trial, comparing chlorpromazine (CPZ) and clozapine (CLZ) in treatment naive patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia. In all, 160 inpatients with first-episode schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder were randomized to CPZ or CLZ and followed them for 52 weeks or until dropout. The primary efficacy measure was time to first remission and proportion of time remaining in remission. The analysis was supplemented by comparisons on a profile of clinical symptoms and side effects. Of these first-episode patients, 80% achieved remission within 1 year (79% CPZ, 81% CLZ). The Kaplan-Meier estimated median time to first remission was 8 weeks for CLZ vs 12 weeks for CPZ (chi(2)(1)=5.56, p=0.02). Both the rate of first achieving remission and the odds for being in remission during the trial were almost doubled for the CLZ group in comparison with the CPZ group. At 12 weeks, CLZ was superior on many rating scale measures of symptom severity while CPZ was not superior on any. These symptom differences remained significant when controlling for EPS differences. By 52 weeks many of the symptom differences between groups were no longer significantly different. Generally, CLZ produced fewer side effects than CPZ, particularly extrapyramidal side effects. There was no significant difference between treatments in weight change or glucose metabolism. For each prior year of untreated psychosis, there was a 15% decrease in the odds of achieving remission (OR=0.85; CI 0.75-0.95). A high proportion of first-episode patients remitted within 1 year. We detected no difference in the proportion of first-episode patients receiving CLZ or CPZ that achieved remission. However, first-episode patients receiving CLZ remitted significantly faster and remained in remission longer than subjects receiving CPZ. While the CLZ group showed significantly less symptomatology on some measures and fewer side effects at 12 weeks, the two treatment groups seemed to converge by 1 year. Longer duration of untreated psychosis was associated with lower odds of achieving remission.", "outbound_citations": ["8935797", "15000267", "11479064", "22033637", "11305847", "11282684", "11099266", "11099280", "10831479", "10784476", "11040879", "10618014", "10553730", "10200732", "9988841", "10667742", "9555612", "8988952", "9366001", "8599400", "8941173", "8526237", "8098203", "8092334", "1503130", "1684719", "1746289", "1883257", "3064280", "2870753"], "inbound_citations": ["36669344", "36651070", "36396628", "36228647", "35757201", "35631466", "35322769", "35339740", "35032906", "34625629", "34622272", "34547594", "34509129", "34482368", "34338130", "34449689", "33985351", "33734165", "33626593", "33503523", "33518516", "33255489", "32938513", "32743658", "32303037", "32093460", "31982601", "31829775", "31766049", "30840788", "30115598", "30218445", "30115597", "30071838", "29982701", "29659460", "28645229", "29268835", "28806194", "28736101", "28736102", "28669774", "28626271", "28155220", "27919182", "28258419", "28062471", "28274026", "27785605", "27853387", "31997959", "27364816", "27307187", "27206330", "25962699", "27271593", "28361822", "27106681", "27052109", "26792993"], "label": "0"}

The authors report results from a controlled investigation to determine the anti-ADHD efficacy of bupropion in adult patients with DSM-IV ADHD.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel, 6-week trial comparing patients receiving sustained-release bupropion (up to 200 mg b.i.d.) (N=21) to patients receiving placebo (N=19). The authors used standardized structured psychiatric instruments for diagnosis of ADHD. To measure improvement, they used separate assessments of ADHD, depression, and anxiety symptoms at baseline and each weekly visit.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 40 subjects (55% male) enrolled in the study, 38 completed the study. Bupropion treatment was associated with a significant change in ADHD symptoms at the week-6 endpoint (42% reduction), which exceeded the effects of placebo (24% reduction). In analyses using a cutoff of 30% or better reduction to denote response, 76% of the subjects receiving bupropion improved, compared to 37% of the subjects receiving placebo. Similarly, in analyses using Clinical Global Impression scale scores, 52% of the subjects receiving bupropion reported being \"much improved\" to \"very improved,\" compared to 11% of the subjects receiving placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results indicate a clinically and statistically significant effect of bupropion in improving ADHD in adults.

We studied methylphenidate effects in ADHD from a neurophysiological perspective, recording event-related potentials (ERPs) during attention task performance in normal controls and children with ADHD under different dose conditions. Twenty children with ADHD and 20 age matched controls were assessed with a continuous performance task requiring subjects to identify repeating alphabetic characters. ERPs and behavioural measures were recorded and analyzed for trials where a correct response was made. The ADHD group was assessed off drug (baseline) and on placebo, low (0.28 mg/kg) and high (0.56 mg/kg) dose levels of methylphenidate. The results showed that the ADHD group at baseline was more impulsive and inattentive than controls and had shorter P2 and N2 latencies and longer P3 latencies. Low dose methylphenidate was associated with reduced impulsivity (fewer false alarms) and decreased P3 latencies, whereas the higher dose level was associated with reduced impulsivity and less inattention (more hits), as well as increased P2 and N2 latencies and decreased P3 latencies. Amplitudes were unaffected and there were no adverse effects of the higher dose for any of the children.

Baseline body mass index (BBMI; kg/m2) and dose (mg/day) were investigated as predictors of long-term weight change experienced during olanzapine treatment.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis analysis retrospectively examined 573 patients receiving olanzapine and 103 patients receiving haloperidol for 39 weeks or more from a study of 1,996 patients randomly assigned 2:1 to either olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/day, or haloperidol, 5 to 20 mg/day. After 6 weeks of acute therapy, patients continued for 1 year or more with either double-blind or open-label olanzapine therapy or double-blind haloperidol therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean weight gain for olanzapine-treated patients observed for a median of 2.54 years trended toward a plateau after the first 39 weeks of treatment with a last-observation-carried-forward mean weight change of 6.26 kg (13.8 lb) and a median of 5.90 kg (13.0 lb). This was significantly higher than that for haloperidol-treated patients, whose mean weight gain was 0.69 kg (1.5 lb) after 1.15 years (p < .001). Patients with higher BBMI (> 27.6) gained significantly less weight during treatment with olanzapine than their lighter counterparts (BBMI < 27.6) (p < .001). The effect of olanzapine dose on weight was not significant (p > or = . 183). Median serum glucose at endpoint was not significantly associated (p = .096) with weight change for olanzapine. Median serum cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure for olanzapine-treated patients at endpoint showed a relationship with weight change that was statistically (p < or = .001) but not clinically significant. The difference in incidence of elevated serum glucose, cholesterol, or diastolic blood pressure between olanzapine and haloperidol therapy groups was not different (p > .05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMean weight gain during olanzapine treatment trended toward a plateau after the initial 39 weeks of treatment with no further significant gain out to 3 years. Higher BBMI was predictive of a lower long-term weight gain, while dose was not a significant predictor of greater longer term weight change.

Although amisulpride is a highly selective D(3)/D(2) receptor antagonist, it is assumed to have atypical properties as well. The purpose of this article was to compare the atypical profile of amisulpride with that of the 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonists.\n\n\nMETHOD\nRandomized controlled trials that compared amisulpride with conventional antipsychotics or placebo for patients with schizophrenia were identified and included in a meta-analysis. The mean effect sizes found for amisulpride were compared with those of an updated meta-analysis of the 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonists.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighteen randomized controlled trials of amisulpride (N=2,214) were found. In 11 studies of acutely ill patients it proved to be consistently more effective than conventional antipsychotics for global schizophrenic symptoms (measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) and negative symptoms. Amisulpride is to date the only atypical antipsychotic for which several studies of patients suffering predominantly from negative symptoms have been published. In four such studies amisulpride was significantly more effective than placebo. Three small studies with conventional antipsychotics as comparators showed only a trend in favor of amisulpride in this regard. Amisulpride was associated with clearly lower use of antiparkinsonian medication and with fewer dropouts due to adverse events than conventional antipsychotics.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results cast some doubt on the notion that combined 5-HT(2)/D(2) antagonism is the reason that the newer antipsychotic medications are effective for negative symptoms and have fewer extrapyramidal side effects.", "outbound_citations": ["11432684", "11099280", "11032464", "10868465", "10846708", "10693159", "10722180", "10622347", "10553730", "10484947", "10401441", "10468313", "10376128", "10435771", "10200742", "10211140", "9988841", "10667742", "10416728", "9659857", "9682999", "9430133", "9442338", "9564201", "9519098", "9298518", "9202309", "9443524", "9305410", "9193198", "9218164", "9218165", "9156369", "9090332", "9068769", "8996184", "8834417", "7894879", "7802104", "8066441", "1973843", "2695141", "3046553", "3059473", "3802833"], "inbound_citations": ["37137892", "36959286", "36199306", "35370857", "34906610", "34227057", "33922888", "33184770", "31630215", "30998952", "31140342", "30720484", "30905125", "30243680", "30349268", "30157448", "29280209", "30192088", "30022465", "29368205", "29145751", "28947383", "28704786", "28624433", "28776162", "27242069", "28447878", "28447882", "28398342", "28185671", "28332719", "27877130", "27833237", "26826431", "26852073", "26227799", "25769091", "30115172", "25895634", "25679126"], "label": "0"}

A comprehensive narrative review was also conducted on all articles that did not yield quantitative information but did yield important qualitative information.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPlacebo was associated with a mean weight reduction of 0.74 kg. Among conventional agents, mean weight change ranged from a reduction of 0.39 kg with molindone to an increase of 3.19 kg with thioridazine. Among newer antipsychotic agents, mean increases were as follows: clozapine, 4.45 kg; olanzapine, 4.15 kg; sertindole, 2.92 kg; risperidone, 2.10 kg; and ziprasidone, 0.04 kg. Insufficient data were available to evaluate quetiapine at 10 weeks.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBoth conventional and newer antipsychotics are associated with weight gain.

Compared with the pretreatment baseline, results indicated that for olanzapine and clozapine, therapeutic response was closely related to an absolute and relative gain in weight and to a gain in BMI. No association between weight gain and therapeutic response was found for risperidone and haloperidol. These findings suggest that patients who are likely to have the maximal benefits of olanzapine or clozapine treatment for symptom alleviation are at the highest risk of a clinically significant increase in weight gain.", "outbound_citations": ["11320682", "11379836", "11210998", "11232752", "10903413", "10936629", "10868465", "10831479", "10811242", "10553730", "10546681", "10440458", "10442434", "10401912", "10350036", "9989571", "9989565", "10074871", "10548138", "10548137", "9858756", "9659858", "9578237", "9028746", "9118359", "8659621", "8633697", "8680464", "8848454", "7624778", "7481576", "7961563", "7902561", "1606496", "1728188", "1679253", "2908235", "3059473", "1145194", "4606856"], "inbound_citations": ["37146461", "34928563", "34699852", "34535474", "33508799", "33626593", "33240120", "31860457", "31207653", "31085419", "30503765", "30506237", "29920116", "29403343", "29129510", "28412089", "28412887", "28143762", "28366084", "27889922", "27280032", "27721972", "27187561", "26450657", "26747088"], "label": "0"}

Using data from a large urban perinatal registry, relative risks of selected perinatal outcomes were determined for maternal cocaine users who were non-smokers of cigarettes, and used no marijuana, heroin, amphetamines, or alcohol (n = 64), and for cigarette smokers who do not use illicit drugs or alcohol during pregnancy (n = 3209).

The ACEI was replaced by nifedipine or clonidine in 15 kidney transplant patients immunosuppressed with AZA and prednisone (enalapril in 14 and captopril in 1). Before and during 10 to 12 weeks after withdrawal of the ACEI, AZA metabolites, renal function parameters and hematological parameters including erythropoietin and reticulocytes were evaluated. Enalaprilat levels were measured and compared with 15 similar patients matched for transplant function and enalapril dosage immunosuppressed with cyclosporine and prednisone. AZA metabolites did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of the ACEI. Enalaprilat levels also showed no significant difference between the two patient groups treated with AZA or cyclosporine. Hematocrit and hemoglobin increased significantly from 37.5 +/- 6.4 to 39.7 +/- 3.6% (mean +/- SD, P = 0.02) and 12.8 +/- 2.2 to 13.5 +/- 1.2 g/dl, P = 0.04, respectively, 10 to 12 weeks after ACEI treatment had been discontinued. Simultaneously numbers of reticulocytes and erythropoietin concentrations rose significantly after 2, 4 and 10 weeks, with a peak at two weeks (from 14.1 +/- 3.8 to 20.6 +/- 8.0/1000, P < 0.05 and from 14.3 +/- 12.4 to 29.3 +/- 54.5 mU/ml, P < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, ACEI-related anemia in renal transplant recipients seems to be due to the erythropoietin-lowering effect of this group of drugs. A pharmacokinetic interaction between AZA and enalapril is not likely since plasma enalaprilat levels were independent of the immunosuppressive regimen and AZA metabolite levels were unchanged in the presence and absence of the ACEI.

Because clonidine is an analgesic, we also evaluated postoperative pain and analgesic requirements. We studied 60 patients undergoing elective ear or nose surgery. General anesthesia was induced with 2.0 mg/kg propofol, 1.5 micro g/kg fentanyl, and 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium. General anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and 70% nitrous oxide in one group of patients; in the other, a continuous infusion of propofol (8 mg [centered dot] kg-1 [centered dot] h-1) was administered (without nitrous oxide). Five minutes before tracheal extubation, patients in each group were randomly assigned to receive saline, placebo, or 3 micro g/kg clonidine intravenously. Postanesthetic shivering was evaluated by a blind investigator. Postoperative pain was assessed using a visual analog scale. Post-operative shivering was observed in 53% of the patients given isoflurane without clonidine and in 13% of the patients given propofol without clonidine. No patient given clonidine shivered. Clonidine administration significantly reduced postoperative pain. The incidence of postanesthetic shivering was significantly less after propofol anesthesia than after isoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia.

The results of the three trial stages, as well as those of the 20 age- and sex-matched normal controls, were compared. A shorter total sleep duration was evident during the methylphenidate treatment compared with that of baseline and placebo treatment. The amount of quiet sleep was lower (however, not significantly) among the study group compared with controls, whereas no such difference was noted during methylphenidate treatment. Night-to-night sleep pattern stability was found. No other differences were found either between children with ADHD and controls or between on and off stages of methylphenidate treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results support the notion that ADHD is a centrally generated disorder attributable to hypoarousal, which subsequently stimulates motor overactivity.

We examine response patterns in subgroups defined by baseline variables (moderators) or variables related to treatment implementation (mediators).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe reconducted random-effects regression (RR) analyses, adding factors defined by moderators (sex, prior medication use, comorbid disruptive or anxiety disorder, and public assistance) and a mediator (treatment acceptance/attendance).\n\n\nRESULTS\nStudy outcomes (N = 579) were upheld in most moderator subgroups (boys and girls, children with and without prior medication, children with and without comorbid disruptive disorders). Comorbid anxiety disorder did moderate outcome; in participants without anxiety, results paralleled intent-to-treat findings. For those with anxiety disorders, however, behavioral treatment yielded significantly better outcomes than community care (and was no longer statistically different from medication management and combined treatment) regarding ADHD-related and internalizing symptoms. In families receiving public assistance, medication management yielded decreased closeness in parent-child interactions, and combined treatment yielded relatively greater benefits for teacher-reported social skills. In families with high treatment acceptance/attendance, intent-to-treat results were upheld. Acceptance/attendance was particularly important for medication treatments. Finally, two thirds of children given community care received stimulants. Behavioral treatment did not significantly differ from, but medication management was superior to, this subgroup.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nExploratory analyses revealed that our study (the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [MTA]) results were confirmed across most baseline variables and treatment acceptance/attendance. In children with ADHD plus anxiety, behavioral treatment surpassed community care and approached medication-based treatments regarding parent-reported ADHD symptoms.", "outbound_citations": ["10591283", "9489260", "9294378", "9256586", "9170760", "9183129", "9100431", "8885584", "8083147", "8034812", "2808258", "7410654"], "inbound_citations": ["37243373", "36971690", "36960813", "36963301", "36526924", "36474201", "36037580", "35854648", "35697402", "35315600", "35076887", "35039978", "34085557", "33864938", "33772416", "33349455", "33277675", "33247007", "33294627", "32921265", "32971803", "32891368", "32559806", "32503395", "32233772", "32054558", "31996577", "31996571", "31967914", "31667859", "31079242", "31507070", "31411903", "29029564", "31222721", "31112441", "31020405", "31020392", "29538764", "30217770", "29254391", "30791800", "28103058", "30724327", "30084719", "27806212", "30352885", "30303966", "28635543", "28617075", "28913744", "29560540", "25755259", "29543891", "29484581", "30166774", "29172596", "29028437", "28902066", "28983797", "29029676", "29072963", "29198277", "27917460", "28944045", "28562259", "28333510", "28202705", "24505061", "28221063", "28212067", "27117555", "27902542", "26951059", "28453206", "28053283", "26258927", "27618640", "22863769", "27038550", "27061373", "26882332", "25985978", "26599576", "26587055", "25010226", "26402485", "26233632", "25956966", "26246793", "26075486", "25906699", "25212229", "25885011", "25885010", "25777975", "23413185"], "label": "0"}

Methods Fifty-four patients scheduled for ECCE were randomly divided into three groups of 18. The first group received one drop of 0.50% apraclonidine topically one hour before surgery and immediately after the end of the procedure. The second group received the same regimen but with 0.25% apraclonidine. The third group received artificial tears as the control group. IOP was measured 12 h preoperatively and 6 and 24 h postoperatively. All the measurements were made using the same Goldmann applanation tonometer by the same surgeon who did not know to which group the patient belonged. Results Preoperative mean IOP was 13.66 \u00b1 2.76 mmHg in the first group, 14.27 \u00b1 2.24 mmHg in the second and 14.5 \u00b1 1.34 mmHg in the control group. The differences were not significant (p=0.398). Mean IOP at the early postoperative visit (6 h) was significantly lower in the first group (17.44 \u00b1 4.95 mmHg) than the second (21.78 \u00b1 7.19 mmHg) and the control group (24.55 \u00b1 5.65 mmHg) (p<0.001).

Performance decrements with sleep deprivation occurred in visual scanning, running memory, logical reasoning, mathematical processing, the Stroop test, the time wall test, tracking and visual vigilance. Interestingly, with sleep deprivation some tests improved and others did not deteriorate. Improvements with medication following sleep deprivation were seen in running memory, logical reasoning, mathematical processing, tracking and visual vigilance.

Aims To determine the efficacy of risperidone in combination with a mood stabiliser in acute mania. Method Patients taking a mood stabiliser were randomised to 3 weeks' treatment with risperidone (n=75) or placebo (n=76). Results Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores improved rapidly with significantly greater reductions at week 1 in the risperidone group compared with the placebo group. At end-point YMRS scores decreased by 14.5 and 10.3 points in the risperidone and placebo groups, respectively. Significant improvements v. placebo (P < 0.05) were noted in the risperidone group on several other clinically meaningful measures. Additionally, a post hoc analysis excluding carbamazepine-treated patients (plasma concentrations of risperidone active moiety were 40% lower in this group) revealed significantly greater reductions (P=0.047) in YMRS scores in the risperidone group than in the placebo group.

A 1-4-week single drug treatment phase (risperidone 1-3 mg bid or mirtazapine 30 mg nocte) was followed by a 2-4-week combined drug treatment phase at unchanged doses. Twelve patients were enrolled, nine of whom were treated with risperidone in the single drug phase.

Data from one patient suggest that adding risperidone to mirtazapine does not result in clinically relevant changes in plasma concentrations of either compound.

In addition to MPH, two other drugs were administered in order to affect both transmitter systems more selectively, L-dopa (dopamine (DA) agonist) and desipramine (DMI) (noradrenaline (NA) re-uptake inhibitor). Sixteen children with ADHD performed a stop-task, a laboratory task that measures the ability to inhibit an ongoing action, in a double-blind randomized within-subjects design. Each child received an acute clinical dose of MPH, DMI, L-dopa, and placebo; measures of performance and plasma were determined. The results indicated that inhibition performance was improved under DMI but not under MPH or L-dopa. The response-time to the stop-signal was marginally shortened after intake of DMI. MPH decreased omission and choice-errors and caused faster reaction times to the trials without the stop-tone. No effects of L-dopa whatsoever were noted. Prolactin levels were increased and 5-HIAA levels were lowered under DMI relative to placebo. It is suggested that the effects of MPH on attention are due to a combination of noradrenergic and dopaminergic mechanisms. The improved inhibition under DMI could be serotonergically mediated.", "outbound_citations": ["1615139", "14726726", "12431845", "11955467", "11864724", "11383964", "11343600", "11032388", "10942848", "10432470", "10326773", "9888856", "10721056", "9670096", "9534087", "9100428", "9147839", "9090335", "8780417", "8833026", "8866721", "9231317", "8856731", "7771915", "7700252", "8226583", "8444762", "1359594", "2066453", "2004254", "2681316", "2676967", "3805329", "3510796", "6949167", "7047618", "22792"], "inbound_citations": ["36971690", "34534624", "34489713", "33227299", "33184299", "33783470", "31734785", "31952937", "30027839", "30337626", "29872385", "29460165", "27956461", "28116581", "27608958", "27743550", "27019103", "25985978", "26599576", "25348645", "25748775"], "label": "1"}

These promising results provide support for further studies of tomoxetine over an extended period of treatment.", "outbound_citations": ["8780417", "7771913", "3233245", "2868490", "3889968"], "inbound_citations": ["37166701", "36226261", "33085721", "33718894", "28974127", "30668425", "25876607", "29419345", "23966351", "30296883", "29674270", "29177453", "29557078", "29382960", "29172673", "28211596", "23475825", "27931908", "27496573", "26966012", "26730199", "26329980", "25761840", "23422237", "24942409", "25092688", "25035246", "24738746", "24202115", "24309869", "24102798", "23672818", "23813665", "23376704", "23397050", "22820275", "23083022", "22305866", "22721596", "22298359", "22266414", "22357846", "22017969", "14609347", "21955201", "21927630", "21645510", "21870887", "21833565", "20875636", "21488751", "21459735", "21396130", "21346736", "21265936", "21136299", "21041618", "20958842", "20521876", "20051220", "21432596", "19849892", "19458384", "20035588", "19703480", "19761781", "19716683", "19745649", "19689165", "19153040", "19026407", "19300997", "19218850", "19025777", "19430599", "18728815", "15639778", "14715439", "18775366", "18836579", "18456311", "18568443", "18615170", "18025250", "18094324", "18448861", "18094325", "18728812", "18824823", "18026719", "17644072", "17709815", "20532025", "17572882", "17137560", "17623385", "18000665", "17300859", "17425471", "17489712", "17464703", "16930863", "17607335", "17417746", "19412494", "17144785", "16896954", "16473440", "20963194", "16499880", "16699602", "16633145", "16389583", "16336224", "16321724", "16523251", "15700344", "16441891", "16379515", "16202140", "16197353", "16190797", "15817135", "18568102", "15717291", "15820237", "15526000", "15725968", "15737659", "15841682", "15665150", "15665154", "16282088", "15910008", "16097847", "15152632", "15514392", "15283948", "15322419", "15338851", "15853579", "15219466", "15231966", "15197048", "15064003", "15108182", "15115947", "15026486", "15046532", "15046533", "14709943", "14742801", "14717619", "14681910", "15303310", "15322961", "14749146", "14513926", "12874488", "12831341", "12842303", "12768267", "12751480", "12665410", "12679740", "12642429", "12547466", "12490769", "12804126", "12456942", "12431845", "12562061", "12392351", "12562062", "11833633", "12562059", "12351753", "12154153", "12233989", "12095664", "11920844", "12685525", "15985863", "11967475", "12625990", "11838625", "11707164", "11694667", "11772286", "11483144", "11336608", "11270920", "11282697", "11276407", "11156812", "11642475", "11436956", "11068899", "10913503", "11052411", "10674194", "10674191", "10857386", "11052410", "16049846", "10588407", "10560028", "10550499", "10445644", "10350032", "21227275", "9757857"], "label": "0"}

Also highlighted are facets of the design that predisposed the study in favour of a differentially positive outcome for pharmacological relative to behavioural treatment. Primary among these is the fact that outcome was measured 4\u20136 months after the intensive phase of behaviour treatment and after therapeutic contact with the behaviour therapist had ended but while medication treatment was active and in its most intensive phase. Finally, the outcome for the combined treatment condition in the MTA is discussed in the context of the extant literature and directions for future research.", "outbound_citations": ["11211364", "11104314", "10103335", "9648036", "9294378", "8885584", "8871362", "7665456", "8370857", "8326053", "1593027", "7380749", "16795561"], "inbound_citations": ["36971690", "32772881", "32429586", "31996571", "31411903", "30388029", "29744873", "28532324", "28532329", "27449186", "26882332"], "label": "0"}

Although within the child\u2010psychiatry literature earlier investigations were inconsistent regarding such a link, recent prospective studies that followed hyperactive children and normal controls into adulthood have found that hyperactive adults with a history of ADHD are more likely than controls to have substance\u2010use disorders. The substance\u2010abuse literature is less consistent regarding the potential association between ADHD and substance abuse. However, recent studies suggest that persons with a substance\u2010use disorder, and particularly those with a cocaine\u2010use disorder, may be more likely than the general population to have a childhood history of ADHD. Some of the inconsistency regarding this association Is due to differences in diagnostic criteria, type of assessments used, and reliability of information obtained. Each of the potential relationships that may exist between ADHD and substance abuse has treatment implications for the clinician. Pharmacological as well as nonpharmacological approaches deserve further investigation. Because pharmacotherapy is a central component in the treatment of childhood ADHD, clinicians designing a strategy to treat both a substance\u2010use disorder and ADHD need to consider pharmacological interventions. At present, the literature on pharmacological treatment for childhood ADHD is extensive and that for adult ADHD is growing; information regarding the treatment of cocaine abuse and concomitant ADHD symptoms remains limited.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31783089", "31228508", "25416463", "28590363", "28368271", "28475500"], "label": "0"}

MP was given on a twice\u2010daily schedule (mean dose: 25 mg/day) in 40% of patients and three times daily (mean dose: 39.3 mg/day) in 60%. A nonlinear regression model was applied to estimate overall population values of MP clearance and elimination half\u2010life (t1/2), assuming a one\u2010component model with first\u2010order absorption and elimination, and further assuming that clearance is linearly related to body weight. The model incorporated each patient's dosage size and schedule, body weight, and time of the plasma sample. Iterated solutions of best fit were: t1/2, 4.5 hours (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.1\u20138.1 hours), and apparent clearance, 90.7 ml/min/kg (95% CI: 74.6\u2013106.7 ml/min/kg).

Behavior was evaluated by parent, teacher, and clinician reports and by direct classroom observations.

Partialling out severity of ADHD did not alter the significant superiority of methylphenidate on CD ratings specifically (P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMethylphenidate has short-term positive effects on children and adolescents with CD.

Supersensitivity psychosis (SSP) has emerged as a potential side effect of long-term neuroleptic therapy similar to tardive dyskinesia (TD). 2. Six schizophrenic patients with SSP, considered to be drug-resistant, were treated with risperidone, while another 5 were treated with clozapine. 3. The 6 risperidone-treated patients (all women) were rated on the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale as at least very much improved. Among the 5 clozapine-treated patients, all 4 men were found to have a marked response to clozapine, while the female patient was judged to be minimally improved. 4. It is hypothesized that not only TD but also SSP arise from destruction of cholinergic interneurons in the striatum as a consequence of prolonged neuroleptic administration. Thus, the drug-induced parkinsonism, which was proposed as mediating the antipsychotic effect of dopamine D2 blocking drugs, depends on the integrity of these cholinergic neurons. If these neurons are destroyed, drugs such as haloperidol lose their therapeutic effect. 5. In contrast, atypical neuroleptics like clozapine and risperidone reduce dopamine release in the striatum independently of prior production of extrapyramidal symptoms and, in this way, may be effective in psychotic illnesses unresponsive to classical anti-D2 neuroleptics. 6. In the present sample of patients, it is worth noting that schizophrenic men were good responders to clozapine.

Since there is no information on the neuroendocrine effects of sequential combined treatment with 17 beta-estradiol and a progestin, the present study evaluated the neuroendocrine, clinical vasomotor and psychological changes before and after different sequential combined HRT regimens (17 beta-estradiol plus nomegestrol acetate, or cyproterone acetate, or vaginal progesterone). Vasomotor and behavioral effects were evaluated by using the Kupperman score, while changes in plasma endorphin (beta-END) levels were used as marker of neuroendocrine effects. Postmenopausal women (n = 30) were randomly divided into three groups (ten women for each group); all women received continuous 17 beta-estradiol (50 mg, transdermal) and each group was sequentially treated with different progestins for 12 days/month: group A, cyproterone acetate (5 mg p.o.); group B, nomegestrol acetate (5 mg p.o.); and group C, progesterone (100 mg, vaginal cream). A group of healthy fertile women (n = 8) served as control. Before and after 6 months of HRT, postmenopausal women underwent an evaluation of subjective Kupperman score and two neuroendocrine tests: (a) naloxone (4 mg i.v.) and (b) clonidine (1.25 mg i.v.). Plasma beta-END levels were measured before and at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min after drug injection. Control women were studied by administering the two neuroendocrine tests only once. Postmenopausal women before HRT showed a pathological Kupperman and no changes of plasma beta-END levels in response to the clonidine and naloxone tests score. On the contrary the increase was significant in healthy women. In each of the three groups of treated women both naloxone and clonidine tests induced a significant increase in plasma beta-END levels (P < 0.01). After 6 months of HRT, an improvement of vasomotor and psychological symptoms was shown by a decrease of Kupperman score. The present study indicates that sequential treatment with transdermal 17 beta-estradiol and progestin, no matter which progestin was used, restores the beta-END release, improves vasomotor and psychological symptoms.", "outbound_citations": ["7626478", "8486201", "8508135", "12318226", "1508061", "1681744", "18411167", "2114281", "2139451", "2533055", "2725335", "2851506", "3792576", "3517595", "2934609", "4063234", "6095154", "6087664", "6091195", "6289277", "7312007", "6791684", "6997020", "6243095", "755961", "174899", "171569", "4859320"], "inbound_citations": ["34432008", "30454602", "28284896"], "label": "0"}

The efficacy and tolerability of topiramate, a novel anticonvulsant, and bupropion SR when added to mood stabilizer therapy were compared under single-blind conditions (rater-blinded) in patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I/II depression.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 36 out-patients with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) scores > or = 16 were randomized to receive escalating doses of either topiramate (50-300 mg/day) or bupropion SR (100-400 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis using the last observation carried forward method.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe percentage of patients meeting a priori response criteria (> or = 50% decrease from baseline in mean HDRS-17 total score) was significant for both topiramate (56%) and bupropion SR (59%) [t(17) = 2.542, p = 0.04 and t(17) = 2.661, p = 0.03, respectively]. Baseline demographic and clinical parameters were comparable between the two treatment groups. The mean doses of study medication were 176 mg/day (SD = 102 mg/day) for the topiramate-treated group and 250 mg/day (SD = 133 mg/day) for the bupropion SR-treated group. A significant and comparable reduction in depressive symptoms was observed from baseline to endpoint following topiramate and bupropion SR treatment, according to a > or = 50% reduction in the HDRS-17. Total mean HDRS-17 scores significantly decreased from baseline to endpoint in both groups (p = 0.001), however, differences between the topiramate-treated group and the bupropion SR-treated group were not significant [t(36) = 1.754, p = 0.097]. Both topiramate and bupropion SR were generally well tolerated. Thirteen patients discontinued the study: 2 because of lack of efficacy, 1 due to withdrawal of consent and 10 following side-effects (six in the topiramate and four in the bupropion SR-treated group). There were no cases of affective switch in either arm. Weight loss was experienced by patients in both groups (mean weight loss at endpoint was 1.2 kg in bupropion SR and 5.8 kg in topiramate) [t(17) = 2.325, p = 0.061 and t(17) = 2.481, p = 0.043, respectively].\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese preliminary data suggest that adjunctive topiramate may reduce depressive symptom severity in acute bipolar depression.

Therefore, we studied the equipotency ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing maxillo-facial surgery.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter approval of the local ethics committee and informed consent 40 patients (age > 18 year, ASA I-III) were studied. Following randomization, the patients each received a PCA device containing either clonidine (bolus 30 micrograms), or piritramide (bolus 1.5 mg) for treatment of postoperative pain (lockout interval 5 min in both groups). During the postoperative period, pain was determined using a visual analogue scale, while analgesic consumption, sedation, haemodynamic parameters, respiration rate, and the occurrence of undesired side effects were documented additionally.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe groups had comparable distributions of biometric data, duration of anaesthesia, and ASA classification. Pain level decreased significantly (P < 0.0001) in both groups during the first 2 h of PCA. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were lower (P < 0.05) in the clonidine group 4 and 6 h after PCA onset, while the degree of sedation after 2 (P < 0.01) and 6 (P < 0.05) h was higher than in the piritramide group. Nausea and vomiting were more frequent (P < 0.05) in the piritramide group. Both groups showed a wide interpatient variation in analgesic requirement. The equipotency ratio clonidine/piritramid was 1:63.7.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIntravenous clonidine is a potent analgesic and is suitable or the treatment of postoperative pain following maxillo-facial surgery. The analgesic potency of 150 micrograms clonidine i.v. was equivalent to that of 9.56 mg piritramide i.v. Nausea and vomiting occurred more rarely in the clonidine group, while deeper sedation was observed more frequently than in the piritramide group. Owing to the wide interindividual variation of analgesic consumption, clonidine dosages have to be adjusted to the actual requirements.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["28928573", "28781453"], "label": "0"}

This paper describes the results of the first placebo-controlled comparison of the efficacy, safety, and effects on sexual functioning of sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline. This randomized, double-masked, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicenter trial enrolled 360 patients with moderate-to-severe recurrent major depression. Patients were treated with bupropion SR 150 to 400 mg/d, sertraline 50 to 200 mg/d, or placebo for up to 8 weeks. Patients' depression and sexual functioning were assessed at weekly or biweekly clinic visits; safety was assessed by regular monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, and body weight. Treatment groups were similar at baseline in terms of age, sex, and race, and most patients had a diagnosis of moderate uncomplicated depression. Patients treated with bupropion SR or sertraline showed similar improvements on all efficacy measures; both active treatments were superior to placebo in improving scores on all rating scales for depression at various time points. Significantly more patients treated with sertraline experienced orgasmic dysfunction throughout the study than did patients treated with bupropion SR or placebo (P < 0.001). Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event in all 3 treatment groups and occurred with similar frequency in each group (30% to 40%). Nausea (31%), diarrhea (26%), insomnia (18%), and somnolence (17%) occurred in significantly more patients in the sertraline group than in the bupropion SR group (18%, 7%, 13%, and 3%, respectively) and the placebo group (10%, 11%, 4%, and 6%, respectively). Dry mouth occurred more frequently with bupropion SR (19%) than with sertraline (14%) or placebo (12%), although the differences were not significant. Changes in vital signs were similar in all groups. Similar (small, but not statistically significant) decreases in mean body weight were seen in both the bupropion SR (-1.06 kg) and sertraline (-0.79 kg) groups, whereas the placebo group experienced a minor increase (0.21 kg). Although bupropion SR and sertraline were similarly well tolerated and effective in the treatment of depression, sertraline treatment was more often associated with sexual dysfunction and certain other adverse events compared with bupropion SR and placebo.

The authors postulated that using clonidine as a component of intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) would enhance postoperative analgesia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nForty-five patients undergoing ambulatory hand surgery received IVRA with lidocaine, 0.5%, and were assigned randomly and blindly to three groups. The control group received intravenous saline, the intravenous clonidine group received 1 microg/kg clonidine intravenously, and the IVRA clonidine group received 1 microg/kg clonidine as part of the IVRA solution. After their operations, the patients' pain and sedation scores and analgesic use were recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients in the IVRA clonidine group had a significantly longer period of subjective comfort when they required no analgesics (median [range]) for 460 min (215-1,440 min), compared with 115 min (14-390 min) for the control group and 125 min (17-295 min) for the intravenous clonidine group (P<0.0001). The patients who received IVRA with clonidine reported significantly lower pain scores 1 and 2 h after tourniquet deflation compared with the other groups, and they required no fentanyl in the postanesthesia care unit. They also required fewer analgesic tablets (325 mg acetaminophen with 30 mg codeine) in the first 24 h (2+/-1, mean +/- SD) compared with the other two groups, 5+/-1 tablets (control) and 4+/-2 tablets (intravenous clonidine) (P<0.0001). No significant postoperative sedation, hypotension, or bradycardia developed in any of the patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe addition of 1 microg/kg clonidine to lidocaine, 0.5%, for IVRA in patients undergoing ambulatory hand surgery improves postoperative analgesia without causing significant side effects during the first postoperative day.", "outbound_citations": ["9710416", "9539603", "9049557", "9259870", "8853097", "7653819", "7598236", "7596627", "7978444", "8093828", "8398960", "1567041", "1664508", "1928767", "2024745", "2011742", "2780066", "3163552", "2580126", "2417042"], "inbound_citations": ["35624418", "35250317", "33043691", "31570204", "29109641"], "label": "0"}

A retrospective analysis was performed on Positive and Negative Syndrome Symptoms (PANSS) data obtained from the published Canadian multicenter risperidone trial (part of the North American trial). Cluster analysis applied to endpoint PANSS scores, including all patients (N = 135), identified three clusters representing 130 patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptomatology. A narrative health state profile was written for each cluster, and 100 psychiatric nurses from Washington, DC, were asked to assign preference ratings to each one using linear analog and standard gamble (SG) methods. Mean utility values (confidence interval 95%) obtained from the SG ratings for the three health state profiles were 0.61 +/- 0.069 (mild); 0.36 +/- 0.073 (moderate); and 0.29 +/- 0.071 (severe). The mild health state (including the majority of risperidone 6 mg-treated patients) was rated by nurses to have a 0.25 +/- 0.0501 greater utility than the moderate health state (composed of the majority of haloperidol-treated patients). The results of these utility evaluations (SG) by the nurses were related to the clinical outcome for three of the six drug treatment groups (N = 65) by multiplying the percentage of patients in each of the three clusters, both at baseline and end-point, who were receiving risperidone 6 mg/day, haloperidol, or placebo, by the utility value for the health state assigned to that cluster. The gain in utility for risperidone-treated patients was 2.6 times higher (0.125) compared with haloperidol-treated patients (0.049), and 7 times higher compared with placebo (-0.021). After multiplying the gain in utility of each treatment by the remaining expected life span for men and women, it was found that risperidone-treated patients obtained more than twice as many quality-adjusted years as haloperidol patients.

One of the defining criteria for an atypical antipsychotic is the relative lack of persistent prolactinemia. A double-blind, placebo- (N = 68) and haloperidol- (Hal: 15 +/- 5 mg/day, N = 69) controlled trial of three dose ranges of olanzapine (Olz-L: 5 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N = 65; Olz-M: 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N = 64; Olz-H: 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day, N = 69) in the treatment of schizophrenia afforded the opportunity to assess the temporal course of the influence of olanzapine and haloperidol on serum prolactin concentration. Consistent with its potent D2 antagonism, haloperidol was associated with a statistically significantly higher incidence of treatment-emergent prolactin elevation (72%) than seen with placebo (8%; p < 0.001) at week 2 of therapy. Expectedly, this elevation was also persistent at weeks 4 and 6. In contrast, olanzapine-associated treatment-emergent prolactin elevations were both lower in magnitude and transient. At week 2, 38% of the Olz-H, 24% of the Olz-M, and 13% of the Olz-L treatment groups exhibited a treatment-emergent prolactin elevation, with a mean increase of 0.35, 0.52, and 0.61 nmol/l, respectively; for haloperidol the mean increase was 1.23 nmol/l. For only the Olz-M and the Olz-H treatment groups did the week 2 incidence of treatment-emergent prolactin elevations differ statistically significantly from placebo. Both the incidence of elevations and the mean increase, in prolactin concentration were less than that seen with haloperidol. Furthermore, by treatment week 6, all three olanzapine groups exhibited incidences of treatment-emergent prolactin elevation that were comparable to placebo and were statistically significantly less than observed with haloperidol. Rapid adaptation was observed in the temporal course of prolactin elevations associated with olanzapine based on both the categorical analysis of treatment-emergent high values and the analyses of temporal change in mean concentrations. In contrast to haloperidol, the magnitudes of the treatment-emergent elevations associated with olanzapine were minimal. The rates of elevation were approximately one-half to one-third those observed with haloperidol and were significantly more transient.

Before and after each trial, subjects completed handgrip strength testing, spirometry, and quality-of-life measures (RAND). On days 7 and 14, each subject completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Results: ESS scores were lower while taking modafinil (mean 248 mm; 95% confidence limit 220 to 276 mm) as compared with placebo (309 mm; 281 to 336 mm) (p < 0.001).

The treatment effect size (0.71) was similar to those observed in previous atomoxetine studies that used twice-daily dosing. Parent diary ratings suggested that drug-specific effects were sustained late in the day.

The study group comprised a cohort of 65 children who had suffered intrauterine exposure to amphetamine due to maternal drug abuse. This group has been followed since birth and examined at regular intervals. Information regarding the academic performance of the children was gathered from the school authorities. The psychosocial environment of the children was determined through interviews and through information obtained from the social authorities. Of the 64 children who attended a school within the state school system, 10 (15%) were a year behind for their age. The mean grades were significantly lower than those of their classmates. Behavioural problems were mentioned in the social authority documentation of one-third of the children, regardless of whether the child was placed in a foster home or was residing with the biological mother. A positive significant correlation was found between maternal age and the outcome of the children, as well as between therapy during pregnancy and outcome, whilst several environmental factors, particularly during the child's first four years, correlate negatively to outcome. Psychosocial factors early in life influence the outcome at 14 years. The positive effect of intervention during pregnancy illustrates the importance of early identification preferable during pregnancy.", "outbound_citations": ["8878368", "8640051", "7531039", "7936850", "8115209", "7510063", "8233743", "7507470", "7681518", "7504891", "1518686", "1377199", "1719469", "1865534", "2681639", "7270093", "517149", "1212022", "1130581", "4683866"], "inbound_citations": ["35082702", "32977207", "32934591", "31402049", "29185821", "28950153"], "label": "0"}

Quetiapine (ICI 204,636, \u2018Seroquel\u2019) is a new atypical antipsychotic agent with a similar binding profile to the original atypical antipsychotic, clozapine. Its clinical efficacy has already been demonstrated at multiple fixed doses (150\u2013750 mg/day) and has been suggested to be comparable with haloperidol (12 mg/day). Methods. This international, 6-week, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial compared quetiapine with haloperidol (455 mg and 8 mg mean total daily doses, respectively) in 448 hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of chronic or subchronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R), in order to establish their equivalence in terms of efficacy, and the nature of their tolerability profiles, especially in terms of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and serum prolactin levels. Results. Both quetiapine and haloperidol produced a clear reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity of Illness and Global Improvement scores. At day 42, the PANSS total score was reduced by \u221218\u00b77\u00b11\u00b763 in the quetiapine group, and \u221222\u00b71\u00b11\u00b763 in the haloperidol group (P = 0\u00b713, between-treatment). Quetiapine was better tolerated than haloperidol in terms of EPS as demonstrated by the significant differences in the Simpson Scale and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores (P<0\u00b705). Although patients in both groups had elevated serum prolactin concentrations at baseline, mean serum prolactin concentration decreased (by 16\u00b75 \u03bcg/l) in quetiapine-treated patients, yet increased (by 5\u00b79 \u03bcg/l) in patients treated with haloperidol. Conclusion. Quetiapine is an effective and well tolerated antipsychotic of comparable efficacy to haloperidol and lacks the latter compound's effect on prolactin and EPS.", "outbound_citations": ["9270900", "9193196", "9090331", "24946189", "8860193", "8733823", "8690831", "8873295", "8822534", "7585841", "1341991", "1358125", "1680296", "1979045", "3616518", "6124580", "4917967"], "inbound_citations": ["32012278", "31303314", "31006114", "29040947", "28109665"], "label": "0"}

Additional objectives of this trial were comparing the antipsychotic effectiveness of the two treatments and the use of antiparkinsonian medication. Effects of flexible doses of risperidone and haloperidol were compared in 77 psychotic patients (83% with chronic schizophrenia) with disturbing neuroleptic-induced EPS (risperidone 40 patients, haloperidol 37). The trial was completed by 47 patients: 25 in the risperidone group (12 women, 13 men), and 22 in the haloperidol group (10 women, 12 men). An adequate antipsychotic effect was obtained in most patients by both treatments. The primary aim of this trial was comparing parkinsonism measured with the extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS) during treatment with risperidone and haloperidol. Two primary parameters were selected: the change from baseline to the worst score during treatment of ESRS II (parkinsonism) and ESRS VI (clinical global impression of severity of parkinsonism). The CGI of severity of parkinsonism was better with risperidone (P=0.025), while the parkinsonism total score tended to be better with risperidone (P<0. 10). Before the double-blind treatment, 34 (of the 77) had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 18, haloperidol 16). During the double-blind treatment phase, 21 patients had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 11, haloperidol 10). The larger reduction of parkinsonism in the risperidone group was not due to a difference in the use of anti-parkinsonian medication.

Response was defined as a 20% decrease of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) psychosis factor score sustained over 2 consecutive ratings. Differences between responders and nonresponders with regard to selected baseline variables were analyzed with t tests and chi2 tests. In addition, Cox regression analyses were performed to identify variables that best predicted a response to clozapine treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClozapine responders were rated as less severely ill, showed a lesser degree of negative symptoms, and demonstrated fewer extrapyramidal side effects at baseline as compared with nonresponders.

Two underlying cognitive processes (response inhibition and response reengagement) were assessed by measuring the probability and speed with which subjects could inhibit responses to a primary task (forced-choice letter discrimination) and immediately execute a response to a secondary task (simple reaction time) when given a signal to do so. Results indicated that MPH enhanced cognitive flexibility, although the high dose was less effective than lower doses in enhancing response inhibition. Dissociations of dose effects on cognitive function and behavior were demonstrated: Dose-response functions for changes in behavior were linear, whereas the function for response inhibition was U-shaped.

Although 8 of the 25 patients could not perform the RT tasks when taking placebo, there were no effects of clozapine on simple or choice RT compared to placebo or fluphenazine. Subjects on all 3 treatments showed visual dominance: faster RT to lights than to tones on choice and double-stimulus trials. However, clozapine reduced this by means of a selective increase in RT to lights. Clozapine reduced failures to respond to the tone on double-stimulus trials. This was shown to be due to reductions in hallucinations. Clozapine does not generally improve attention, but it may increase the ability of schizophrenic persons to process nondominant or unattended stimuli possibly by increasing the efficiency of resource allocation. This may be partially mediated by a reduction in hallucinations.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31836933", "31770500", "28809649", "25859763"], "label": "0"}

Cardiovascular events were reviewed and followed up to identify cases of prolongation of QTc interval. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality rates between sertindole and the comparator cohort, although confidence intervals (CI) were wide due to small numbers in the sertindole cohort.

To investigate a possible mechanism, we measured hemodynamic responses to isoflurane administered via mask; we also administered clonidine for premedication, lidocaine topically to the nasal mucosa, or lidocaine intravenously to evaluate the effect of these drugs on the hemodynamic responses. Methods:Forty ASA physical status 1 patients (aged 20-30 yr) scheduled for elective oral surgery participated in the study. Thirty patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups: a control group, a group receiving 3-4 \u00b5g \u00b7 kg-1 of oral clonidine for premedicatlon, and a group receiving 2 ml of 4% lidocaine spray to the nasal mucosa. Ten patients were assigned nonrandomly to a group receiving intravenous lidocaine continuously (0.4 mg \u00b7 kg-1 bolus followed by 30 \u00b5g \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 min-1 ) after the initial randomized experiments were done to test whether systemic lidocaine blunts the responses to inhaled isoflurane. Anesthesia was induced with thlamylal, after which inhalation of 1% isoflurane in 100% oxygen via mask was begun. The inspired concentration of isoflurane was increased by 1% every 5 min to a maximum of 4%. During normocapnia and without surgical stimulation, heart rate and systolic blood pressure were measured every minute for 20 min before and during isoflurane inhalation. Plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured before and at each isoflurane concentration. Results:In the control and Intravenous lidocaine groups, an increase in isoflurane concentration from 2% to 3% significantly increased systolic blood pressure (peak changes of 16 \u00b1 5 and 15 \u00b1 6 mmHg, respectively) and heart rate (peak changes of 23 \u00b1 3 and 13 \u00b1 4 beats \u00b7 min -1, respectively). A change in concentration to 4%, however, did not significantly alter hemodynamics. Blood pressure and heart rate responses to a change to 3% Isoflurane were significantly blunted in the groups receiving clonidine (peak changes of 4 \u00b1 4 mmHg and 8 \u00b1 3 beats \u00b7 min-1, respectively) or nasal lidocaine (peak changes of 2 \u00b1 1 mmHg and 4 \u00b1 2 beats \u00b7 min-1, respectively) compared with the control group. In all groups, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrlne concentrations increased after administration of 2% and 1% Isoflurane, respectively. Plasma lidocaine concentrations were 0.3-1.3 \u00b5g \u00b7 kg-1 in the nasal lidocaine group and 0.6-1.5 \u00b5g \u00b7 kg-1 in the intravenous lidocaine group. Conclusions:Stepwise increases in isoflurane concentration elicited hypertension and tachycardia as well as increments in plasma catecholamine concentrations during mask anesthesia. Nasal administration of lidocaine and clonidine premedicatlon significantly blunted the circulatory responses to isoflurane. intravenous lidocaine did not significantly weaken the responses to changes in isoflurane concentration.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["25635137"], "label": "0"}

Because this association has not been confirmed in controlled studies, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in Tennessee Medicaid enrollees, which included many antipsychotic users; there were also computer files describing medication use and comorbidity. The study was conducted before the introduction of risperidone and, thus, did not include the newer atypical agents.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe cohort included 481,744 persons with 1,282,996 person-years of follow-up. This included 26,749 person-years for current moderate-dose antipsychotic use (>100-mg thioridazine equivalents), 31,864 person-years for current low-dose antipsychotic use, 37,881 person-years for use in the past year only, and 1 186,501 person-years for no use. The cohort had 1487 confirmed sudden cardiac deaths; from these, we calculated multivariate rate ratios adjusted for potential confounding factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhen current moderate-dose antipsychotic use was compared with nonuse, the multivariate rate ratio was 2.39 (95% confidence interval, 1.77-3.22; P<.001). This was greater than that for current low-dose (rate ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.72; P=.003) and former (rate ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.58; P<.001) use. Among cohort members with severe cardiovascular disease, current moderate-dose users had a 3.53-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.66-7.51) increased rate relative to comparable nonusers ( P<.001), resulting in 367 additional deaths per 10,000 person-years of follow-up.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients prescribed moderate doses of antipsychotics had large relative and absolute increases in the risk of sudden cardiac death. Although the study data cannot demonstrate causality, they suggest that the potential adverse cardiac effects of antipsychotics should be considered in clinical practice, particularly for patients with cardiovascular disease.", "outbound_citations": ["12745306", "11276025", "10744090", "10763090", "10659877", "10391652", "9845790", "9656728", "9864072", "9864081", "9778547", "9694935", "9603539", "9308514", "9220048", "9269252", "9229210", "9138706", "9079253", "9345668", "7497760", "7485055", "8536153", "7882483", "7837861", "8196728", "7918900", "8037998", "1304415", "1370216", "1753045", "1681681", "2064251", "1868416", "2214099", "2202203", "2376181", "2188483", "2286228", "2646920", "3337021", "3718167", "3946396", "6145728", "7055867", "7266115", "123182"], "inbound_citations": ["37155984", "36399950", "36786118", "36271347", "35873271", "35625713", "35331005", "33995146", "33905638", "34018956", "32614955", "32402075", "32346603", "32189527", "32142077", "33304987", "31622875", "31390681", "31536102", "31439658", "31175270", "30707117", "30540347", "30715539", "30292087", "30192094", "30416734", "28339816", "29274734", "29128324", "28004385", "29181788", "28556266", "27727006", "28071178", "25917167", "27400984", "27061849", "27216904", "27222142", "26921160", "26837728", "26957335", "26705121", "25923490", "23625911", "26210551", "26403992", "25745835", "26174524", "25713294", "25520374", "25449032", "25305001", "25234794", "24981132", "24960522", "24915260", "24704220", "23986353", "23896958", "23112292", "23560596", "23859938", "23553446", "23220685", "23276816", "23172692", "23295003", "22748401", "23069370", "21920969", "22410947", "21441006", "12109926", "22270810", "22126992", "20952453", "21796719", "21872442", "21961030", "23051122", "21749976", "21923607", "20826552", "21565711", "20838345", "21103142", "21165329", "28770795", "20394793", "20648676", "20547231", "20087851", "20079791", "20053540", "20194404", "20029823", "19144938", "20514211", "19647079", "19637402", "19828952", "19524406", "19109802", "18562398", "19033525", "18977443", "19761280", "19929028", "18693297", "18662288", "18691283", "18711951", "18499875", "19305792", "18666802", "18324881", "18004143", "17974865", "17982510", "17646130", "17687661", "17611010", "17548409", "17489713", "17477877", "16863665", "17036366", "17295199", "16869820", "17444079", "17944000", "17074284", "17040251", "16735649", "16684946", "16449697", "16970508", "16389124", "15963244", "16327872", "16227057", "16096514", "16014647", "16135861", "15933484", "15701099", "15705456", "16194791", "15541322", "15226162", "15260906", "15013027", "15065743", "14687852", "15484154", "15259536", "14623502", "24944403", "12833303", "12812006", "12729864", "12745049", "12709470", "12697001", "12424166", "12503836", "12042224", "12162273", "12503253", "11735846", "11691681"], "label": "0"}

The overall cost effectiveness of managing spasticity using baclofen and tizanidine was very similar ( pound 10.50 and pound 10.49 per STD respectively). The incremental cost effectiveness (ICE) of using tinzanidine as an alternative to baclofen for first-line treatment was pound 10.47 per STD.

Secondary assessments of efficacy included the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Clinical Global Impression Scale. Safety and tolerability evaluations included neurologic ratings, vital signs, and assessment of treatment-emergent side effects. Eighteen of 20 patients enrolled in the study completed 6 weeks of open-label treatment. The dose range of quetiapine was 25 to 300 mg daily, with an average of 100\u00b170 mg/d.

The present study examined sensitivity to reinforcement in 2 boys diagnosed with ADHD using the matching law to provide more precise and quantitative measurement of this construct. This experiment also evaluated the effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on sensitivity to reinforcement of children with ADHD. Subjects completed math problems to earn tokens under four different variable-interval (VI) schedules of reinforcement presented in random order under both medicated and nonmedicated conditions. Results showed that, in the medicated condition, the matching functions for both subjects resulted in higher asymptotic values, indicating an overall elevation of behavior rate under these conditions. The variance accounted for by the matching law was also higher under the medicated conditions, suggesting that their behavior more closely tracked the changing rates of reinforcement while taking MPH compared to placebo. Under medicated conditions, the reinforcing efficacy of response-contingent tokens decreased. Results are discussed with respect to quantifying behavioral changes and the extent to which the drug interacts with prevailing contingencies (i.e., schedule values) to influence behavioral variability.", "outbound_citations": ["9708839", "9708840", "9433787", "21331827", "9093895", "9000892", "8995834", "7706155", "16795839", "7844054", "16795838", "16812734", "1582963", "2056161", "2373655", "2921585", "2971034", "3597291", "3805493", "4034622", "6511702", "6619440", "6619441", "22478577", "7137695", "501274", "474732", "16811935", "16811440", "13945507", "13785321", "13713775", "1365648"], "inbound_citations": ["36002446", "35098025", "32509138", "31412279", "31976951", "28423911"], "label": "1"}

Patients were randomly assigned to 8 weeks' treatment with placebo, one of four doses of risperidone (2, 6, 10, or 16 mg), or 20 mg of haloperidol daily.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClinical improvement (20% reduction in total scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia) at the study end point was shown by 35% of the patients receiving 2 mg of risperidone, 57% receiving 6 mg, 40% receiving 10 mg, and 51% receiving 16 mg; and by 30% receiving haloperidol and 22% receiving placebo. Statistically significant differences in clinical improvement were found between 6 and 16 mg of risperidone versus placebo and versus haloperidol. Positive symptom scores were significantly lower after 6, 10, and 16 mg of risperidone and 20 mg of haloperidol than placebo; negative symptom scores, however, were reduced significantly, compared with placebo, only after 6 and 16 mg of risperidone. The incidence of extra-pyramidal side effects (measured by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale) was significantly higher in patients treated with 16 mg of risperidone or 20 mg of haloperidol than placebo. The results indicate that the optimal daily dose of risperidone for most schizophrenic patients in this study was 6 mg; this dose was as effective as 16 mg, and the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms in patients receiving 6 mg of risperidone was no higher than that in patients receiving placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRisperidone is a safe antipsychotic that is effective against both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.", "outbound_citations": ["7683702", "1375801", "1379882", "1381102", "2125857", "2378546", "2571717", "2484825", "2460616", "3046553", "2466393",

The present study was performed to discover how far it is possible to combine the benefits of sevoflurane (fast modulation of depth of anaesthesia, rapid emergence and recovery) and clonidine (reduction of perioperative stress response, prophylaxis of postoperative shivering, analgetic, antiemetic and anaesthetic-saving effect) without compromising the pharmacokinetic of sevoflurane. Twenty-eight patients were included in the present double-blinded prospective study. These patients were randomly treated with an infusion of 4 micrograms kg-1 clonidine (group 1) or a placebo (group 2) preoperatively. For anaesthesia a standardized procedure with fentanyl, propofol, rocuronium, N2O/O2/sevoflurane and an antiemetic prophylaxis with DHB was performed. The depth of anaesthesia was controlled by using spectral edge frequency (target--SEF90 = 10 Hz). Perioperative stress response was assessed by noting the effects on haemodynamic parameters (MAP, heart rate), and emergence and recovery were assessed by using established standardized tests. We confirmed the anaesthetic-saving property of clonidine only for fentanyl (-20%). On the other hand, there was no difference in MAC-sevoflurane values between the groups in keeping a steady target--SEF90 (1.62 +/- 0.26 versus 1.65 +/- 0.24 vol.%). The time until emergence and recovery was not significantly different. Even the occurrence of PONV, the VAS level or the postoperative analgesic requirement did not differ in the two groups. However, the incidence of postoperative shivering was significantly higher in the placebo group. The stress response to intubation or extubation was lower in the clonidine group. The haemodynamic parameters in the clonidine group were intraoperatively always below the baseline, in some cases by more than 20%, making therapy for hypotension or bradycardia frequently necessary. Postoperatively, the majority of the patients showed similar changes in these parameters, but did not reach the 20% mark. Preoperative clonidine comedication seems to complicate the management of anaesthesia. On the other hand, it is beneficial during the early postoperative period (e.g. stability in haemodynamics, prophylaxis of shivering) without compromising emergence and recovery. Our results show that therapy with clonidine should be better placed at the end of anaesthesia.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["26256531"], "label": "0"}

The aim of the current study was to provide a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that tested the efficacy of clonidine in this regard. Methods Data was collected from a MEDLINE search of English-language studies published from 1980 to 1999 and a manual search of bibliographies from retrieved articles. A total of 28 studies were assessed. According to the selection criteria (study design, population, intervention, and outcome) and a quality scoring system, seven studies were finally included in the meta-analysis. After homogeneity was established by &OV0422; value, the data were then combined using the fixed-effects model. The pooled odds ratio was calculated. A subgroup analysis based on the types of surgery and administration route was also performed to qualify the results. The results were expressed as odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Results Heterogeneity of outcome data was negative in the trials. The pooled odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.34\u20130.71). In the subgroup analysis, clonidine reduced the incidence of myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing cardiac and noncardiac surgery. Rates of bradycardia were similar in clonidine and placebo groups. Conclusion The meta-analysis suggests that perioperative clonidine reduces cardiac ischemic episodes in patients with known, or at risk of, coronary arterial disease without increasing the incidence of bradycardia. Therefore, these findings strongly justify planning and execution of a definitive study seeking the benefits of clonidine.", "outbound_citations": ["10584742", "11441269", "10212709", "10195508", "8873539", "8868976", "8825545", "7634816", "7978438", "8400091", "8395129", "8102063", "8431573", "1351752", "1672060", "2001026", "3285731", "3259409", "2908485", "3434164", "3942335", "3901740", "7081725"], "inbound_citations": ["34742542", "33802308", "33186162", "31998026", "31623842", "31606306", "29739539", "28420580", "27396805", "29444390", "26256531"], "label": "0"}

Olanzapine has a multireceptorial binding profile including a greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT(2A) than for dopamine D(2) receptors. Olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day demonstrated significantly greater antimanic efficacy than placebo in two double-blind, randomised 3- or 4-week trials of patients with bipolar I disorder of either manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features. Additionally, in one of these trials, improvements in cognitive function and hostility were superior with olanzapine. In cohorts of severely depressed and rapid cycling patients, improvements in manic and depressive symptoms and in manic symptoms only, were superior with olanzapine compared with placebo. Significant improvements from baseline in symptoms of mania, depression, cognitive functioning and hostility were seen with olanzapine in a 49-week extension phase study. In double-blind trials, olanzapine 10 mg/day appeared to have similar antimanic efficacy to oral lithium 400mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with pure mania (4-week small study). In patients with acute manic or mixed episodes olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day appeared to be more effective than oral valproate semisodium (divalproex sodium) 500 to 2500 mg/day (3-week study) and at least as effective as oral haloperidol 3 to 15 mg/day (12-week study). Preliminary results from a large 6-week placebo-controlled study suggest that olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day in combination with mood stabilisers (lithium or valproate semisodium) provides effective augmentation of antimanic treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder, with benefits seen in the first week. Adverse events reported significantly more often with olanzapine than with placebo were somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness and bodyweight gain, and in comparison with valproate semisodium were somnolence, dry mouth, increased appetite and bodyweight gain. Olanzapine was generally well tolerated with no clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory tests, vital signs or electrocardiogram results. Olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy compared with placebo in the short-term treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features, and was generally well tolerated. According to preliminary data the antimanic efficacy of olanzapine appears similar to that of haloperidol and better than that of valproate semisodium in patients with bipolar I disorder experiencing a manic or mixed episode; among nonpsychotic patients with manic or mixed episodes olanzapine appears to be superior to haloperidol. Available data support the choice of olanzapine as an option in the short-term management of mania in patients with bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features.", "outbound_citations": ["11483480", "11476123", "11488360", "11388949", "11379842", "11302568", "11305706", "11199953", "11226809", "11164757", "11235936", "11217867", "11232738", "11219487", "11112937", "11073289", "11057521", "11030483", "11018214", "11018219", "11030485", "11048906", "10986547", "10910807", "10917399", "10982206", "10868465", "10811244", "10912212", "10773184", "10770461", "10895797", "10708730", "10704958", "10761825", "10653223", "10817103", "10933124", "10755582", "10372605", "10622184", "10565800", "10340682", "10511917", "10499158", "10366691", "10404715", "10350035", "10350036", "10227113", "10475721", "10211140", "10051059", "10074872", "9987206", "10192405", "10192407", "9825080", "10327902", "9860152", "9721035", "9659858", "9609675", "9532349", "9510228", "9534021", "9551772", "9501894", "9730076", "9559756", "9803767", "9481807", "9432516", "9505989", "9265915", "9833015", "9184614", "9028746", "9122367", "9010634", "8822532", "8822533", "11224268", "1354253", "728692", "6080235", "9855322", "9401315", "7883737", "10350045", "10497709", "9781473", "11642474", "11465308", "8882376", "9989565", "10884900", "7480537", "9674940", "9448668", "9511951", "10584170", "8848537", "7544900", "9491062", "11558830", "10843459", "11769820", "9000791", "9288440", "8935797", "10739329", "9265914"], "inbound_citations": ["36198767", "36124550", "35458749", "35326094", "30543891", "29414012", "20155998"], "label": "0"}

We compared the effectiveness of epidural and i.v. clonidine in the prevention of this postanaesthetic agitation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighty children aged 3-8 yr (ASA I-II) received standardized general anaesthesia with inhaled sevoflurane and caudal epidural block with 0.175% bupivacaine 1 ml kg-1 for minor surgery. The children were assigned randomly to four groups: (I) clonidine 1 microgram kg-1 added to caudal bupivacaine; (II) clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 added to caudal bupivacaine; (III) clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v. and caudal bupivacaine; and (IV) caudal block with bupivacaine, no clonidine (control). A blinded observer assessed the behaviour of the children during the first postoperative hour. Secondary end-points were the time to fitness for discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit, and haemodynamic and respiratory variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of agitation was 22, 0, 5 and 39% in groups I, II, III and IV respectively (P < 0.05 for groups II and III compared with group IV). During the first hour after surgery, patients in groups II and III had significantly lower scores for agitation than group IV patients. Time to fitness for discharge did not differ between the four groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nClonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 prevented agitation after sevoflurane anaesthesia, independently of the route of administration.

Group B required significantly less supplementary analgesia after operation (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects between the two groups. The longer duration of sedation in group B (9.1 (2.5) h) resulted partly from the sedative effect of clonidine and partly from the longer duration of analgesia provided by clonidine.

Eighty-four of them failed to respond to that trial and agreed to be randomly assigned to an 8-week fixed-dose trial of either 25 mg/day of olanzapine alone or 1200 mg/day of chlorpromazine plus 4 mg/day of benztropine mesylate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-nine (70%) of the 84 subjects completed the trial. The primary outcome measures were Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score and positive symptom score, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms global score, and Clinical Global Impression score. An analysis of variance for the subjects who completed the study showed no difference in efficacy between the two drugs. Seven percent of the olanzapine-treated patients responded according to a priori criteria; no chlorpromazine-treated patients responded. The olanzapine-treated patients had fewer motor and cardiovascular side effects than the chlorpromazine-treated patients. Extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia were similar in the two groups, although no antiparkinsonian drugs were used in the olanzapine group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOlanzapine and chlorpromazine showed similar efficacy, and the total amount of improvement with either drug was modest.

Pediatric studies have suggested that a mixed amphetamine salt product (Adderall) is safe and effective in the treatment of childhood forms of ADHD. Presently, there are no reports in the scientific literature concerning the safety and efficacy of Adderall in adults with ADHD, which is the focus of this study.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTwenty-four outpatients (mean age = 33.3 years) with DSM-IV ADHD were administered Adderall in an open-label fashion, starting at 5 mg p.o. b.i.d., with titration according to clinical response, across a 16-week period. Relatives or spouses of each patient completed serial checklists (including the Copeland Symptom Checklist and the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scales). Prospectively collected data were analyzed retrospectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirteen patients (54%) responded in a positive manner to Adderall, based on Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale scores. The mean end dose for responders was 10.77 mg/day (0.14 mg/kg/day). An intent-to-treat analysis revealed a decrease in the mean Copeland score from 99.05 to 63.3 (p < .001), while the mean Brown score dropped from 76.75 to 50.85 (p < .0001). Nine patients (38%) were poor responders or nonresponders to Adderall. Acute anxiety symptoms occurred in 4 of 7 patients with a comorbid anxiety diagnosis.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAdderall may be an effective agent for the treatment of adult forms of ADHD, with positive responses occurring at relatively low doses, at least for some individuals. However, Adderall may precipitate anxiety in vulnerable individuals. Further study is required.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31112441", "29382960", "29152677", "27830625"], "label": "0"}

Abstinent subjects at the end of treatment and eligible to proceed (N= 429) were randomized to active bupropion or placebo through Week 52 and then followed for an additional year. The best overall predictor of less relapse to smoking was assignment to active bupropion. In aggregate, the results indicate that bupropion can be prescribed to diverse populations of smokers with expected comparable results. There was a medication effect that was independent of any predictor except older age and those who gained no or minimal weight during the open-label phase. Predictors of successful relapse prevention included lower baseline smoking rates, a Fagerstr\u00f6m Tolerance Questionnaire score of < 6, and initiation of smoking at an older age.

Where present, it has been associated with greater overall morbidity and mortality. Monotherapy with conventional dopamine antagonists may either worsen or bestow a limited therapeutic benefit. Accordingly the use of adjunctive thymoleptics has been explored. In contrast, olanzapine (OLZ), an atypical antipsychotic agent, offers a distinctive and pleotropic pharmacology suggestive of a broader efficacy profile than conventional neuroleptic agents. In a 6-week placebo- and haloperidol (HAL)-controlled trial with 335 randomized subjects with chronic schizophrenia in an acute exacerbation, three fixed dose ranges of OLZ (5, 10, or 15 +/- 2.5 mg) were evaluated versus HAL (10-20 mg) or placebo. Baseline to endpoint change in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale including the anxiety-depression cluster (items 1, 2, 5, 9) was analyzed. Two dose ranges of OLZ (10 +/- 2.5, 15 +/- 2.5) were superior to placebo (p < 05) in improving mood status, whereas HAL was not. Contributions from a more selective mesolimbic dopaminergic profile, D1 or D4 activity, the release of dopamine/norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, and/or serotonin 5-HT2A,C antagonism may explain the differential benefit seen with OLZ in the treatment of comorbid anxious and depressive symptoms in schizophrenia.", "outbound_citations": ["9510219", "9551772", "9247978", "9090331", "9090332", "8822531", "8866762", "7811160", "11224268", "8085135", "7868850", "8104554", "8332655", "1375019", "1674882", "1679253", "2077636", "2679483", "2665688", "2690890", "2574607", "3068116", "3270832", "3167364", "3154502", "3731764", "2865255", "4061685", "4055720", "6474100", "6136307", "6113822", "6105762", "400999", "28711", "78321", "345313", "4917967", "6080235"], "inbound_citations": ["36917730", "36263635", "36286707", "34744818", "33677821", "33229894", "30015109", "27977041", "27099073"], "label": "0"}

Aripiprazole was well tolerated, with similar AE incidence rates to placebo, and lower rates than haloperidol for akathisia, extrapyramidal syndrome and somnolence. Objective EPS assessments demonstrated no significant differences between aripiprazole and placebo on Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) scores, no dose-dependent effects on Barnes Akathisia scores, and significant reductions in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores from baseline vs. placebo (p</=0.01). Haloperidol showed increased SAS and Barnes Akathisia scores over placebo (p</=0.01). There was minimal mean weight change with aripiprazole (+0.71 kg) and haloperidol (+0.56 kg), and a lack of QT(c) prolongation. Serum prolactin increased with haloperidol, but not aripiprazole. In conclusion, aripiprazole shows a favorable safety and tolerability profile with low potential for EPS, weight gain, prolactin elevation, QT(c) prolongation, and sedation.

METHOD: The setting consisted of a large, state-operated, public psychiatric system. The protocol called for the treating psychiatrist to provide symptom- and adverse-effect ratings at four times following the start of drug therapy. The outcome criteria included the Sandoz study outcome measure of symptom improvement as well as discharge status for one year of follow-up. To assess the validity of the ratings, several measures of internal consistency were determined. Clozapine therapy was started in 227 patients, and symptom data are available for 202. RESULTS: Overall, 33 percent (n=66) of the patients were improved at the end of one year of treatment; 12 percent (n=24) maintained symptom improvement at all three evaluation times. Modest, statistically significant improvement after 12 weeks compared with baseline Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores was observed for the patients continuing medication (n=152); the emergence of a previously unimproved group (n=26) explains this modest improvement. However, in the analysis of all patients (n=202), (including dropouts), there was no significant symptom improvement after 12 weeks. Lower baseline BPRS scores predicted significant symptom improvement after 12 weeks of treatment. Among those medicated for one year, the pattern of symptom improvement showed that the probability of late improvement was 0.26 for those previously unimproved, and the probability of a 12-week responder losing improvement was 0.23, resulting in a net group gain of 3 cases in 100. By the end of one year, 8 percent (n=17) of the cohort was discharged, and 3 percent (n=7) was transferred to another facility while continuing to receive clozapine. Of the 227 original patients started on clozapine therapy, medication was discontinued for adverse effects in 11 percent (n=25): white blood cell count (WBC) decrease (but no agranulocytosis) in 5 percent (n=12), seizures in 1 percent (n=3), one patient with seizures and decreased WBC count, and other events (e.g., cardiovascular changes, fever, or possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome) in 4 percent (n=9). Patient refusal was reported for 6 percent (n=13) of those starting treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although only 19 percent of the patients exhibited improvement at 6 weeks, the response rate at 12 weeks (29 percent) for this naturalistic study cohort was similar to that in the major, double-blind, six-week, controlled, clinical trial of clozapine. The impersistence of response as symptoms were followed for up to one year is a finding that deserves rigorous evaluation.", "outbound_citations": ["1418888", "1671793", "1670979", "2222133", "2571612", "2602519", "3046553", "2901253", "3391979", "3407421", "2885310", "2860202", "3883696", "4582360"], "inbound_citations": ["34496316", "34452082", "31982601", "30093869", "26046338", "10178649", "22000940", "22187729", "20648219", "19160174", "12691772", "12131603", "11875287", "11743944", "11384902", "11276406", "10369628", "10368852", "10667741", "9551496", "9474440", "9286183", "9260069", "9366002", "8829743", "7755110"], "label": "0"}

Careful clinical assessment of insomnia in children may include the use of symptom rating scales, laboratory testing, or other medical assessment. Short- and long-term treatment of insomnia in children involves management of etiological factors and associated syndromes. Controlled treatment studies of pediatric insomnia are limited to <10 published studies of psychosocial and/or psychopharmacological treatment in young children. Directive parent education and behavior modification techniques have been effective in short-term treatment of insomnia in young children, and may be the preferred treatment of extrinsic insomnia, as well as an important adjunctive treatment of any insomnia symptoms. Two benzodiazepines [flurazepam and delorazepam (chlordesmethyldiazepam)], one antihistamine (niaprazine) and one phenothiazine [alimemazine (trimeprazine)] have been shown to be effective in the short-term treatment of insomnia in young children, although none of these agents have US Food and Drug Administration approval for pediatric insomnia. Short-acting benzodiazepines may have a role in the brief treatment of pediatric insomnia associated with an anxiety or mood disorder, psychosis, aggression, medication- induced activation, or anticipatory anxiety associated with a medical procedure. However, tachyphylaxis and risk of misuse preclude the long-term use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of insomnia in children. Newer hypnotics, which appear better tolerated than the benzodiazepines in studies of adults, may have a role when combined with psychosocial treatments of pediatric insomnia. Treatment of intrinsic pediatric insomnia may additionally involve chronotherapy or medical management.", "outbound_citations": ["11589530", "11510929", "11437014", "22033588", "11323729", "11313161", "11211371", "11160467", "11322738", "11145319", "11192136", "11051408", "10846305", "10808035", "10804040", "10761353", "10832774", "10734247", "10706346", "10733617", "10903288", "10730329", "10646619", "10674197", "10598057", "10608111", "10517055", "10487068", "10485636", "10087689", "10087688", "10521009", "9859856", "9813955", "10215009", "9633975", "9473913", "9730074", "9488928", "9391769", "9366660", "9291725", "9247389", "9204677", "9183141", "9158439", "9100431", "9279301", "9334895", "8956674", "9065877", "8885585", "8641538", "7775360", "11537903", "8169182", "8296898", "1354861", "1537780", "1738759", "1727200", "1939687", "2009034", "1916651", "2243152", "2365760", "2797970", "2687306", "2768151", "3670967", "3597306", "3551850", "3899048", "3894396", "4089116", "6537391", "7046699", "7388454", "22214", "812671", "10944659", "3340471", "8545530", "9868572"], "inbound_citations": ["33223070", "31638842", "28921528", "29658502", "28300806"], "label": "0"}

Many of these tests have previously been shown to be sensitive to cortical damage (including selective lesions of the temporal or frontal lobes) and to cognitive deficits in dementia, basal ganglia disease, and neuropsychiatric disorder. Qualitative differences, as well as some commonalities, were found in the profile of cognitive impairment between the two groups. The chronic amphetamine abusers were significantly impaired in performance on the extra-dimensional shift task (a core component of the Wisconsin Card Sort Test) whereas in contrast, the heroin abusers were impaired in learning the normally easier intra-dimensional shift component. Both groups were impaired in some of tests of spatial working memory. However, the amphetamine group, unlike the heroin group, were not deficient in an index of strategic performance on this test. The heroin group failed to show significant improvement between two blocks of a sequence generation task after training and additionally exhibited more perseverative behavior on this task. The two groups were profoundly, but equivalently impaired on a test of pattern recognition memory sensitive to temporal lobe dysfunction.

'Reaction time' and 'motor speed' were measured using a computer-aided system and striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was assessed using [I-123]IBZM SPECT. Psychomotor reaction time, parkinsonism, affective flattening and avolition were increased in treated patients relative to the untreated cohort and were negatively correlated with dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability. Significant positive correlations were found between parkinsonism and affective flattening and between psychomotor slowing and avolition. Positive symptoms were not significantly associated with striatal IBZM binding.

The present study was designed to test whether clonidine altered the response to a small intravenous dose of epinephrine, such as that which might be used in an epidural test dose. Methods: In 18 healthy volunteers, four series of determinations were performed in random order and were separated by a minimum 72 h: (1) no premedication followed by intravenous saline 3 ml, (2) no premedication followed by intravenous test dose containing 3 ml of 1.5% lidocaine + 15 micro gram epinephrine, (3) oral clonidine (5 micro gram/kg 1.5 h before hemodynamic determinations) followed by intravenous saline, and (4) oral clonidine followed by intravenous epinephrine\u2010containing test dose. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously, and symptoms associated with central nervous system toxicity were noted. Results: After the test dose injections, HR and SBP increased with or without clonidine premedication. The 95% confidence intervals for the maximum HR increases with and without clonidine were 49\u201361 and 44\u201354 beats/min, respectively, indicating that one could not be absolutely certain that everyone would develop a positive HR response. The HR increase was >or= to 20 beats/min in 18 of 18 volunteers given epinephrine with or without clonidine and in 0 of 18 volunteers given saline. Calculated sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values were all 100% based on the conventional HR criterion and were unaltered by clonidine.

It is thus conceivable that the levels of SIL-2R may in fact return to baseline with continuing clozapine treatment; however, they did not measure SIL-2R levels beyond 6 weeks of treatment. In view of these interesting results, we examined the relationship between SIL-2R levels in groups of patients who were being treated with different antipsychotic drugs to see whether patients treated on a long-term basis with clozapine had higher SIL-2R levels than did patients receiving long-term treatment with other antipsychotics.

Efficacy with aripiprazole was maintained during the study with numerical improvements compared with baseline in all three groups. The overall incidence of AEs was broadly comparable across all groups, and AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity and time-limited. Discontinuations due to AEs were comparable across the groups. No deterioration in EPS occurred in any group.

The mean daily doses of risperidone and zuclopenthixol at the end of the trial were 8 mg and 38 mg respectively. Efficacy was assessed throughout by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia and Clinical Global Impression. Safety assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, UKU Side\u2010Effect Rating Scale, vital signs, body weight and laboratory screening. The results indicate that risperidone is at least as effective as zuclopenthixol for the treatment of acute schizophrenic episodes, with a trend towards greater improvement in the overall severity of symptoms. The onset of action was significantly shorter with risperidone than with zuclopenthixol.

Data supporting this assumption are scarce. The aim of this study was to study attrition rates in randomised controlled trials of oral administration of conventional antipsychotic drugs, atypical antipsychotic drugs and placebo. The database of the Schizophrenia Module of the Cochrane Library was utilised for the present study. The data in the Cochrane Module are collected by identifying relevant randomised controlled trials from several electronic databases and other sources. Number of dropouts was defined as patients leaving the study preterm due to any reason. Data from 328 treatment groups, consisting of 18,585 randomised subjects from 163 drug trials, were entered in the analysis. One-third of the subjects had dropped out of the trials. The dropout rates significantly increased for each calendar year. Year of trial publication, type of drug and trial length remained statistically significant contributors to dropout rates. In a model incorporating year of publication and trial length, placebo groups and groups treated with conventional antipsychotics had significantly higher attrition rates than groups treated with atypical drugs. When clozapine-treated groups were excluded from the analysis, no statistically significant advantage for atypical drugs over conventional drugs remained. Trial data implicate that a better compliance can be achieved by favouring atypical drugs rather than conventional alternatives in the treatment of schizophrenia. However, this effect is found only when groups treated with the atypical antipsychotic clozapine are included in the analysis. Our study did not find evidence for a statistically significant superiority in acceptability of novel atypical drugs when compared to conventional antipsychotics.", "outbound_citations": ["12084413", "10761820", "10663413", "10663410", "10663409", "10647137", "10796543", "10401441", "10360124", "9541337", "9575004", "7891486", "1530133", "419267"], "inbound_citations": ["35059036", "34601449", "33938520", "33402159", "33192929", "32522386", "32547244", "31995411", "31625485", "31422583", "31145432", "31664765", "31625485", "31250403", "31156432", "30300676", "30347460", "29505859", "29950314", "29866212", "29769554", "26265765", "27917593", "27413387", "26696325", "26905887"], "label": "0"}

Psychomotor performance and cognition were assessed using both an extensive battery of validated psychometric tests (which evaluated attention and vigilance, body sway and memory) and an EEG profile. Cardiovascular parameters measured were blood pressure and heart rate. No detrimental effects of nicardipine were found on attention, vigilance, body sway or memory. Nicardipine produced a significant increase in alpha EEG energies, which may indicate possible alerting effects. In contrast, clonidine induced well\u2010known deleterious sedative effects in psychometric tests and in EEG analysis (decrease in alpha and increase in delta and theta waves). The two drugs produced equivalent decreases in blood pressure at steady state. In conclusion, clonidine induced well\u2010known sedative effects, while nicardipine did not impair central nervous system activity and may have had some short\u2010term alerting effects in elderly hypertensive patients with memory complaints.

Six case reports are identified in the literature of pregnant patients who received clozapine. Novartis at Basle, Switzerland, through its pharmacovigilance and epidemiology, service, has data on nearly 200 cases summarized in this article. We also describe the case of a patient with paranoid schizophrenia who was hospitalized 10 times between the age of 22 to 32. She received clozapine when she was 29 years old and, with a daily dosage of 350 mg, she became asymptomatic. At the age of 33 and 37, she became pregnant and continued clozapine during her 2 pregnancies. During her first pregnancy, she received insulin due to gestational diabetes associated with a body weight mass (BWM) of 30.4 (N = 20 to 25). During her second pregnancy, the BWM was 23.7 and she did not develop diabetes. She delivered at term 2 daughters who are at the time of this report 5 and 3 years old. The two girls are doing well and have no developmental delay. Psychotic symptoms exacerbation: the plasma concentration of clozapine diminishes during pregnancy due to a higher hepatic metabolism and distribution volume. Monitoring plasma concentration of clozapine can help to adjust its dosage. In case of psychotic symptoms exacerbation, the following can be recommended: 1) Increase the clozapine dosage; 2) Add a classic antipsychotic like perphenazine, trifluoperazine or haloperidol. Diabetes: obesity, glucose intolerance or a family history of diabetes are risk factors to develop gestational diabetes. The follow-up of patients, who take an atypical antipsychotic, should include constant monitoring of the blood glucose or Hb1A and lipid dosages. Complications at labor: Clozapine increases the secretion of oxytocine and the contraction of the uterine muscle. But, no studies can explain how clozapine affects the labor exactly. Some case studies report use of forceps, vacuum or cesarean.\n\n\nCONVULSIONS\nStoner (1997) described neonatal convulsions 8 days after birth. The mother was receiving 350 mg of clozapine, but also lorazepam and haloperidol during her pregnancy. The newborn withdrawal of lorazepam can increase the risk of convulsions and also haloperidol can diminish the convulsion threshold. Floppy infant syndrome: in the case described by Dimichele (1996), the mother received a daily dosage of 300 mg of clozapine and 2.5 mg of lorazepam 3 to 5 times a day. This can explain hypotonia. Stoner (1997) reports a second case where a mother, who received 600 mg of clozapine during pregnancy, gave birth to a child who had no convulsions neither hypotonia.\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe cases described concerning studies of children until age 2 to 3 years by Stoner (1997) and Dickson (1998) and until 6 years old by Barnas (1994), do not mention any developmental problem, similar to the two daughters of our patient. The pharmacovigilance service of Novarits reports 6% of malformations. But these reports must be considered with caution since they represent only the pregnancies reported spontaneously to the pharmaceutical company. This is only a portion of all pregnancies associated with clozapine.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNo specific risks for the mother and children can be attributed to the use of clozapine during pregnancy. However, the plasma concentration of clozapine is higher in the fetus compared to the mother (Barnas, 1994); therefore, a minimal dosage should be used. Since clozapine is present in the maternal milk, breast feeding should be avoided. The advantages to use clozapine during pregnancy must exceed the risks. It is justified to continue the use of this medication even if data on classic antipsychotics (e.g.: haloperidol) are more extensive. Because the risk of psychotic exacerbation is higher, the substitution of clozapine is not recommended. The psychosocial support and the obstetrical follow-up must be intensive too. An institutional pharmacovigilance service should complement the one provided by the industry. Also, further case-control and cohort studies are essential to better estimate the long-term risks.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33187329", "31090482", "29636684"], "label": "0"}

The sensory and motor function were determined at defined time intervals for 30 minutes. Heart rate and blood pressure were controlled and sedation score was judged. The postoperative 2-segment-regression of pin-prick and the onset of pain were recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe six groups were comparable in demographic data and in term of onset time. The prolongation of analgesia reached 513 +/- 92 min (p = 0.002) for 150 micrograms clonidine, 460 +/- 148 min (p = 0.073) for 100 micrograms clonidine, 440 +/- 86 min (p = 0.057) for 75 micrograms clonidine compared with 347 +/- 114 min for saline. In an equal manner, 2-segment-regression for pin-prick was extended to 251 +/- 47 min (p = 0.018) for 150 micrograms clonidine, 238 +/- 33 min (p = 0.034) for 100 micrograms clonidine, 229 +/- 29 min (p = 0.027) for 75 micrograms clonidine and 178 +/- 43 min for saline. Heart rate dropped down in all groups. Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly in the groups with 75, 100 and 150 micrograms clonidine. Sedation score increased continuously from 0.6 +/- 0.5 (saline) to 1.8 +/- 0.8 (150 micrograms clonidine).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe conclude that 150 micrograms clonidine significantly enhances the duration of analgesia of epidurally administered ropivacaine in a mean of 171 mg. This time interval is longer than the one with 200 mg ropivacaine alone. But, there are side effects in form of decrease of arterial pressure. Cardiovascular monitoring seems to be essential. Because of the enhanced analgesia duration, the time interval for reloading epidural anaesthesia are increased.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Families (n = 50) with a child eligible for the MPT were given 3 bottles of identical capsules. The capsules contained, in random order: placebo of the prescribed dose of methylphenidate (Ritalin) hydrochloride (0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg). Families gave the child 1 capsule at 8 AM and 1 capsule at noon. The family, teacher, and physician were blinded for the order of medication. Conners questionnaires (Conners Parent Questionnaire and Conners Teacher Questionnaire) and written comments were completed by parents and teachers at baseline and at the end of each week. Once MPT results were known and following discussion with the physician, families decided whether to continue methylphenidate therapy. Families were interviewed by telephone 14 to 21 months after the MPT.\n\n\nRESULTS\nForty-three (86%) of the 50 eligible children (mean age, 129 months) were contacted. No family found the MPT difficult, but 6 trials were incomplete, usually because of side effects. All families used the MPT to decide if methylphenidate was the correct treatment choice for their child and 68% (34 of 50 families) used the results exclusively. The remaining 16 families believed the MPT was helpful. Overall, 31 (72%) of the 43 children had a good response to methylphenidate treatment--20 (47%) continued to use it for longer than 12 months and 8 (26%) for 2 to 12 months; 3 responders chose not to use it after the MPT. Nine of the 43 families chose not to use methylphenidate treatment; however, all indicated that participating in the MPT helped them to make that decision. In follow-up interviews, the same proportion of methylphenidate users and nonusers reported improvement in many areas of function including significantly less time spent doing homework. Users reported reduced aggression (P<.001) and fewer discipline problems (P<.01) compared with nonusers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn \"N of 1\" MPT was easily performed and permitted families to decide whether to use methylphenidate for long-term treatment of attention-deficit disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

The present study was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of risperidone in a 6-week double-blind, randomized, parallel-group design in the treatment of aggression in adolescents with a primary diagnosis of DSM-IV disruptive behavior disorders and with subaverage intelligence.\n\n\nMETHOD\nWe randomly assigned 38 adolescents (33 boys; 10 subjects with slightly subaverage IQ, 14 with borderline IQ, and 14 with mild mental retardation), who were hospitalized for treatment of psychiatric disorders associated with severe aggression, to receive risperidone or placebo. The main efficacy measures were the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S), the modified Overt Aggression Scale (OAS-M), and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). Side effects were measured using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean daily dose of risperidone at the end of treatment was 2.9 mg (range, 1.5-4 mg). Risperidone, compared with placebo, was associated with significant improvements on the CGI-S (p < .001) and the at-school ABC overall and hyperactivity scales (p < .05). During a 2-week washout following the 6-week trial, a statistically significant worsening was found in the risperidone group on the CGI-S scale, the OAS-M. and the ABC. Extrapyramidal symptoms were absent or very mild during risperidone treatment. Transient tiredness was present in 11 (58%) of 19 drug-treated subjects. Other untoward effects included sialorrhea, nausea, and slight weight gain (mean = 3.5% of body weight in the risperidone group). No clinically relevant changes were found in laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram, heart rate, or blood pressure.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggest that risperidone may be effective for severe aggression in adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders and subaverage intelligence, and these results are consistent with reports suggesting its effectiveness for treating severe aggression in adolescents in general.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37117632", "36074098", "35894550", "35781194", "34053685", "33928910", "32977887", "32852736", "30797946", "30365289", "30102079", "29865900", "28137460", "28847182", "28791693", "28758203", "26779966", "26779860", "25918843"], "label": "0"}

Recreational use of MDMA generally includes repeated drug consumption, often in association with other drugs, such as alcohol and cannabis. In the laboratory setting, repeated MDMA administration to healthy MDMA consumers produced a time-dependent immune dysfunction similar to that observed with the ingestion of a single dose, and the first of the two administrations paralleled the time-course of MDMA-induced cortisol stimulation kinetics and MDMA plasma concentrations. A significant decrease in CD4 T-helper cells with simultaneous increase in natural killer (NK) cell and a decrease in functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation was observed. Response to the second dose was either long-lasting compared with the first dose or disproportionate and did not show any parallelism with cortisol and MDMA plasma concentrations. This circumstance extended the critical period during which immunocompetence is highly impaired as a result of MDMA use. Accumulation of MDMA in the body of a poor metabolizer induced higher immunomodulatory effects with statistically significant differences in NK cell function compared with extensive metabolizers. When basal values of lymphocyte subsets were examined in a population of recreational MDMA users participating in different clinical trials, alterations in several immunological parameters were observed. The absolute number of lymphocytes, in particular T lymphocytes and CD4 T-helper cell subsets, showed a trend toward reduced values, although cell counts were within normal limits. By contrast, NK cells in MDMA consumers were reduced to one-third of those from healthy persons. A statistically significant decrease in affected immune parameters was recorded during a 2-year observation period in a subgroup of recreational MDMA users. These permanent alterations in immunologic homeostasis may result in impairment of general health and subsequent increased susceptibility to infection and immune-related disorders.", "outbound_citations": ["11720096", "11522159", "11470336", "11710737", "11710739", "11472399", "11340207", "11565625", "11244029", "12404604", "11071707", "10975831", "11085323", "10873928", "10694580", "10852105", "10622275", "10580803", "10659718", "10402155", "9892855", "9610678", "9610682", "9570860", "9506825", "9336014", "8874836", "8788532", "7730652", "4064464"], "inbound_citations": ["35943523", "32306799"], "label": "0"}

Ability to function in activities of daily living and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were also documented. Patients were assessed on 10, 20, and 30 mg of methylphenidate twice daily.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSignificant improvements in cognitive function were observed on the 10-mg twice-daily dose. Functional improvements included improved gait, increased stamina and motivation to perform activities, and in one case, increased bladder control. Adverse effects were minimal and immediately resolved when treatment was discontinued. There was no increase in seizure frequency and the majority of patients on glucocorticoid therapy were able to decrease their dose. Gains in cognitive function and ability to perform activities were observed in the setting of progressive neurologic injury documented by MRI in half of the subjects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study demonstrated improved patient function in the setting of a progressive neurologic illness.

This article describes 5 cases of severe depression that occurred during 2 multicenter trials using bupropion for smoking cessation.\n\n\nMETHOD\nSubjects were participants in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion for smoking cessation. Data from both trials were restricted to subjects at the Rochester, Minn., site in order to have access to the medical records for information on depression diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. The first trial involved 205 smokers who received active bupropion or placebo for 7 weeks. In the second trial, 252 smokers received open-label bupropion therapy for 7 weeks. Those abstinent from smoking at the end of week 7 (N = 148) were randomly assigned to a 45-week, double-blind, relapse-prevention phase.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the first trial, 1 of the 205 participants (0.49%) experienced major depression during the 7-week treatment phase. In the second trial, none of the 252 subjects developed major depression during the 7-week, open-label phase. When results of both trials across the 7-week treatment phase (study 1, N = 205; study 2, N = 252) are combined, the rate of developing major depression was 0.22% (1 of 457). Of the 457 subjects, none of the 51 who received placebo and 1 (0.25%) of the 406 who received active bupropion developed major depression. In the second trial, 4 (2.7%) of the 148 subjects randomly assigned to the 45-week, relapse-prevention phase developed depression. Overall, 4 of the 5 cases from the 2 trials had a past history of major depression prior to study entry, but none had current major depression.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMajor depression may occur in some individuals during smoking cessation treatment with bupropion.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["27830625"], "label": "0"}

The overall efficacy for each of the two drugs was similar; although improvement in the trazodone treatment group was significantly greater on day 7 because of the effects on sleep. At the end of treatment, 58% of the bupropion-treated patients and 46% of the trazodone-treated patients were considered much or very much improved.

The adverse experience profiles for bupropion and trazodone were consistent with their known pharmacologic profiles (i.e., activating versus sedating).

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Negative Symptom Rating Scale (NSRS) and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were used to measure psychopathology and extrapyramidal side-effects. Five patients dropped out of the study. Two patients became very agitated and potentially aggressive, one patient became very restless and did not respond to benzodiazepines, and one dropped out because of restlessness that did not respond to clonazepam. Of the 10 patients who completed the study, 50 per cent reduction on BPRS and NSRS was achieved by five and six patients respectively. There was a marginally significant trend towards a greater reduction in the magnitude of negative symptoms. Four patients required treatment with anticholinergic drugs.

Methods Two groups of pregnant healthy women were allocated randomly to receive either 10 mL 0.125% bupivacaine plain solution (group B, n = 10) or with 75 \u03bcg clonidine (group B+C, n = 12). Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were measured over 30 minutes after each epidural injection. Patients were monitored with an automated blood pressure device (Dinamap and a pulse oximeter), and fetal heart rate was measured with a cardiotocograph. Plasma clonidine concentrations were measured at birth in mothers and in the umbilical cord by radioimmunoassay. Results Visual analog scale scores were significantly lower in patients who received clonidine. Patients required a second epidural injection after 55 \u00b1 9 minutes in group B and 127 \u00b1 11 minutes in group B+C (P < .05). Visual analog scale scores were also significantly lower in group B+C than in group B, after the second injection. Decreases in arterial blood pressure were comparable in the two groups, and no patient experienced arterial oxygen desaturation or bradycardia. Fetal heart rate was decreased in group B+C at the time of the second injection. The duration of labor after epidural administration was prolonged in group B+C patients compared to group B (282 \u00b1 43 minutes and 169 \u00b1 26 minutes, respectively, P < .05). Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were similar in both groups. Plasma clonidine concentrations were, respectively, 0.31 \u00b1 0.16 ng/mL 60 minutes after the first injection and 0.62 \u00b1 0.13 ng/mL at birth in mothers while plasma umbilical cord concentrations were 0.56 \u00b1 0.12 ng/mL. Conclusions The study documents that clonidine improves epidural bupivacaine analgesia during labor and demonstrates transfer of the drug across the placenta. Therefore, a more extensive study is required to determine the incidence of possible side effects of clonidine in neonates.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35659958", "31787454", "29486974", "26426577"], "label": "0"}

Spinal anesthesia was performed at either the L2-3 or the L3-4 interspace using 0.5% hyperbaric tetracaine solution 1.4-3.0 mL. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and the upper dermatomal level of analgesia were determined at 1-min intervals with the patient in the supine position after tetracaine injections. When systolic BP decreased to <80% of the prespinal value or <100 mm Hg, IV ephedrine 0.2 mg/kg was administered as a bolus. There were no differences in the duration until the first dose of ephedrine after tetracaine injections, and the upper level of analgesia between groups (control group 8.5 +/- 3.7 min, T5; clonidine group 7.7 +/- 2.7 min, T6). Although prespinal and preephedrine BP values were higher in the control group, the magnitude of increases in mean BP after ephedrine was significantly greater in the clonidine group (P < 0.05). We conclude that oral clonidine premedication augments the pressor response to IV ephedrine during spinal anesthesia. Implications: The pressor effect of ephedrine is enhanced in patients given oral clonidine premedication during spinal anesthesia.

Individuals with dominating disturbance of perception, thinking and cognition were basically diagnosed having schizophrenic. Individuals with mood disturbance were basically diagnosed having affective disorders. However, there were patients who did not fit neatly into either category. In 1933 Jocob Kasanin introduced the term \"schizoaffective psychosis\". Scientific discussions involved the possibility that schizoaffective disorder was conceptualized most accurately as following: a type of schizophrenia, a type of affective disorder, a unique disorder that was separate from both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an arbitrary categorization of clinical symptoms that marked a continuum between schizophrenia and affective illness, a heterogeneous collection of \"interforms\" between schizophrenia and affective disorders. However, diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is included both in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10. Schizoaffective disorder is listed in the category \"schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders\". The differential diagnosis includes basically either schizophrenia or affective disorder. The epidemiological status of schizoaffective disorder is somewhat uncertain compared with schizophrenia because of dilemmas related to diagnosis and classification of the disorder. Treatment of schizoaffective disorder comprises psychotropic medication, supportive psychotherapy, social care, rehabilitation. The most important groups of psychotropic medications are: antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizers. Atypical antipsychotics are the first-line medication for schizoaffective disorder due to their pharmacological properties. In the case of schizoaffective disorders combination of atypical antipsychotics with antidepressants seems to be useful. Novel antidepressants have priority for the combination mentioned above. Peculiarities of mechanism of action of antidepressant are important for combinations. Mood stabilizers seem to be useful for treatment of certain type of schizoaffective disorder as well.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31898212", "28613395", "26750639"], "label": "0"}

Laboratory studies indicate that all local anesthetics are neurotoxic in high concentrations and that lidocaine and tetracaine have neurotoxic potential in clinically used concentrations. However, spinal anesthesia (including lidocaine and tetracaine) has a long and enviable history of safety. Spinal analgesics such as morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil, clonidine, and neostigmine seem to have a low potential for neurotoxicity based on laboratory and extensive clinical use. Most antioxidants, preservatives, and excipients used in commercial formulations seem to have a low potential for neurotoxicity. In addition to summarizing current information, we hope that this review stimulates future research on spinal drugs to follow a systematic approach to determining potential neurotoxicity.

Methods.: Ten patients with probable AD, 10 healthy old controls, and 15 young controls performed a covert orienting of spatial attention task. Young controls performed the task an additional time after ingestion of diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg. Reaction times were obtained following valid, neutral, and invalid cues. Results.: In all groups, the reaction times were shortest for the validly cued stimuli and longest for the invalidly cued stimuli. Additionally, the AD patients performed disproportionately worse following the invalid cue than did the control groups. Young controls given diphenhydramine had decreased subjective alertness, performed worse than they did before drug but better than the old controls or AD patients, and had no disproportionate impairment with the invalid cue. Conclusions.: AD patients have disproportionate problems shifting spatial attention compared with age-matched controls.

Ratings of behavior, including ADHD symptoms, pertaining to the period from dose administration until sleep onset, were supplied nightly by hospital staff. Sleep latency and sleep adequacy were also assessed for each night.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMPH resulted in markedly improved behavioral control compared with placebo; there was no difference between 15-mg and 10-mg MPH doses. MPH did not alter sleep latencies observed with the placebo. Children were more often rated as less tired on awakening after nights that they received 10 mg of MPH compared with 15 mg of MPH and the placebo. Weight loss was apparent among 83% of the patients, but dinner intake did not vary with third-dose condition.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMorning and noon administration of stimulants to children with ADHD is a near-universal practice, but many clinicians avoid a third, late-afternoon administration for fear of inducing insomnia. This study's findings show that children with ADHD derive substantial symptom reduction from MPH administered in late afternoon, with no untoward effects on sleep. Therefore, three-times-a-day dosing should be considered for those children exhibiting ADHD symptoms in the evening. Adverse effects on sleep latency were not apparent in the sample overall. Nonetheless, monitoring for possible aggravation of sleep problems and weight loss remains sound treatment practice.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37043095", "36971690", "35313258", "33003117", "30709574", "30709577", "30382936", "30030127", "28400722", "27754700", "27521251", "25774652"], "label": "1"}

These findings might have been biased by the use of the high-potency antipsychotic haloperidol as a comparator in most of the trials. We aimed to establish whether the new drugs induce fewer EPS than low-potency conventional antipsychotics. We did a meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials in which new generation antipsychotics had been compared with low-potency (equivalent or less potent than chlorpromazine) conventional drugs. We included studies that met quality criteria A or B in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, and assessed quality with the Jadad scale. The primary outcome of interest was the number of patients who had at least one EPS. We used risk differences and 95% CIs as measures of effect size. We identified 31 studies with a total of 2320 participants. Of the new generation drugs, only clozapine was associated with significantly fewer EPS (RD=-0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.4, p=0.008) and higher efficacy than low-potency conventional drugs. Reduced frequency of EPS seen with olanzapine was of borderline significance (-0.15, -0.31 to -0.01, p=0.07). Only one inconclusive trial of amisulpride, quetiapine, and risperidone and no investigations of ziprasidone and sertindole were identified, but some evidence indicates that zotepine and remoxipride do not lead to fewer EPS than low-potency antipsychotics. Mean doses less than 600 mg/day of chlorpromazine or its equivalent had no higher risk of EPS than new generation drugs. As a group, new generation drugs were moderately more efficacious than low-potency antipsychotics, largely irrespective of the comparator doses used. Optimum doses of low-potency conventional antipsychotics might not induce more EPS than new generation drugs. Potential advantages in efficacy of the new generation drugs should be a factor in clinical treatment decisions to use these rather than conventional drugs.", "outbound_citations": ["15000267", "2550989", "2682733", "12832232", "11823257", "11099280", "10721870", "10796543", "10074877", "9794850", "9659857", "9350955", "9310563", "8834417", "8721797", "18245059", "7872041", "7916157", "1981869", "1978469", "1978481", "3046553", "2972165", "2892478", "3323261", "3308412", "3802833", "375865", "374401", "616197", "798582", "1145194", "4154763"], "inbound_citations": ["37207437", "37061079", "36573102", "36628029", "36386987", "35966480", "35910343", "35792918", "34955759", "34652577", "34552059", "34460879", "32540496", "32926285", "32922732", "32404212", "31933179", "31773921", "31296417", "31672699", "31405623", "31444566", "30907448", "31084636", "31040678", "30873052", "31179423", "30615021", "31356294", "30149102", "30560764", "29953902", "30384768", "29983268", "29982313", "29794090", "28734907", "28412910", "28994360", "28477503", "28775195", "28852259", "28059928", "28407198", "28248104", "28109665", "27090803", "27842943", "27615033", "27886063", "27514296", "27540314", "27300250", "27048752", "27209172", "26169975", "27106681", "26831314", "26589388", "26409573", "25829142", "25503261", "25384847", "25482499", "25107588", "25413553", "25211094", "25179095", "25162472", "24766970", "24927744", "24884590", "24818571", "24612386", "25028943", "24564639", "24716500", "24374277", "24414883", "24107597", "24301645", "24236794", "24016726", "23896810", "23810019", "24049446", "23887211", "23757185", "28920199", "23702802", "22282455", "23494934", "22565547", "23313462", "23241613", "23388168", "23305478", "23308071", "22124274", "23157623", "23809174", "28083277", "22954905", "22890247", "22954754", "22942652", "21999805", "22830044", "22534420", "22574973", "22387855", "22364675", "22442101", "22383771", "22383768", "22383767", "22832855", "21463651", "21989253", "21709684", "21266946", "15250749", "22132707", "22212844", "21945084", "21218454", "21508854", "20937506", "21569448", "21334853", "22204194", "21491361", "21552316", "21394633", "21208500", "21271749", "21039418", "21192134", "21172575", "21328719", "20868275", "21496609", "20868641", "21496610", "21110742", "20923620", "20513851", "20482409", "20304506", "20085554", "20207106", "20672521", "20415632", "20370961", "19814949", "20187598", "20855038", "20152550", "19900963", "19838763", "19941000", "19428811", "19910716", "20135898", "19831836", "19594194", "19629799", "19644682", "19641900", "19558339", "19469696", "19290975", "25384566", "21352176", "19015230", "19058842", "18977443", "19011430", "18489517", "18848360", "18708991", "18797397", "18929939", "18827289", "18763218", "18786218", "18764724", "18502616", "18664891", "18461495", "18566801", "18505352", "18515977", "18513127", "18378227", "18451005", "18451004", "18374841", "18243663", "18055180", "18332662", "18310570", "18458771", "18187211", "17933497", "18098217", "17634413", "18234700", "18509216", "18772034", "18533756", "18772030", "18660566", "18060498", "17868197", "18032663", "17974927", "17919153", "17909124", "17786406", "17767708", "17851245", "17521890", "17766765", "17617664", "18019047", "17632215", "17583355", "18019038", "18019041", "17629731", "17667738", "17562697", "17412473", "17259207", "17502771", "17375087", "17453175", "17420195", "17235331", "20528436", "17123682", "17279374", "17224721", "17224722", "16903799", "17242588", "17454730", "17927296", "17650972", "17952424", "17151158", "17109710", "16388932", "17075361", "17054266", "17015810", "16288681", "17015808", "17107261", "16647772", "16585435", "16925501", "16925508", "16925502", "16697427", "16825203", "16816799", "16816797", "16763227", "16763228", "16865937", "16432547", "16863012", "16688482", "16648324", "16675766", "16532448", "16574710", "16528470", "16402076", "16640122", "16504026", "16380237", "16466312", "24940957", "16720514", "16509050", "16696579", "16599647", "16465454", "16341062", "16382375", "15882132", "16126372", "16283277", "16170236", "16055308", "16175107", "16172203", "16157833", "16143728", "15948179", "15994065", "15933479", "15967975", "15953491", "15937262", "15972615", "15693052", "15701108", "15701107", "15647752", "15278098", "16194791", "15642438", "16194784", "15893121", "15637198", "15660702", "15733025", "15608544", "15765260", "15589715", "15584867", "15541064", "15563356", "15140279", "15365209", "15516062", "15260944", "15310154", "15258717", "15201570", "15085089", "15517067", "15043765", "15060530", "15146342", "14992963", "15076013", "14751424", "22034144", "15018839", "15205874", "23570195", "12907021", "12023568"], "label": "0"}

In both groups of children, reaction times (RTs) to arrow stimuli incongruent with the target were longer than those to neutral stimuli (response interference), which were again slower than RTs to target-alone stimuli (perceptual interference).

Demographic information collected was as follows: age, sex, measures of socioeconomic status, and region of residence.\n\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nCommon types of childhood injury in BC: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision N-codes (fractures, open wounds, poisoning/toxic effect, concussion, intracranial, burns) and E-codes (falls, postoperative complications, motor vehicle accidents, struck by object, adverse effects of drugs, suffocation, drowning).\n\n\nDATA SOURCE\nBC Linked Health Data Set and the BC Triplicate Prescription Program.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter controlling for known demographic correlates, odds for injury was greater among those treated with MPH and presumed to have a behavioral disorder, when injury was characterized either by type (1.67; 99% confidence interval: 1.54-1.81) or cause (1.52; 99% confidence interval: 1.40-1.66) of injury. This increased risk extended to unexpected categories of injury such as postoperative complications and adverse effects of drugs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChildren with CBDs have >1.5 times the odds of sustaining injuries of a variety of types from a variety of causes, even after controlling for known demographic correlates, than those without behavioral disorders. The risks for these children extend beyond those that might be directly associated with impulsivity and overactivity.

In contrast with comparison subjects (n = 17). ADHD boys aged 6-12 (n = 27) showed both slower reaction times overall and within-condition (lateral) asymmetries in reaction times. Specifically, boys with ADHD reacted more slowly to uncued targets in the left visual field than in the right visual field. Responses to stimuli in the two visual fields were differentially affected by methylphenidate for the ADHD group. Medication equalized visual field responses to the uncued targets, resulting in a significant cue x dose x visual field interaction. Further, medication altered the relative cue responsivity in the two visual fields, resulting in a significant dose x visual field interaction for the Validity Effect. Biological parents of ADHD boys (n = 16) also showed slower reaction times to uncued left visual field targets than to right visual field targets; in addition they showed slower response to invalidity cued targets in the right visual field.

The goal of this retrospective study was to examine the changes in weight parameters, fasting glucose, and fasting lipids in long-term inpatients treated with either risperidone or olanzapine.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA retrospective study was performed by reviewing charts of patients at Oregon State Hospital, Salem, who were treated during July and August 1999, comparing metabolic outcomes during the first year of therapy with either risperidone or olanzapine. Data were analyzed also by age, sex, and concurrent use of lithium or valproate. Included for analysis were patients at least 18 years old with baseline weights obtained within 3 weeks of drug initiation, and baseline fasting triglycerides, cholesterol, and glucose obtained within 3 months prior to drug initiation and at 1 year of treatment (+/- 4 weeks). The patients meeting these criteria in each drug cohort (risperidone, N = 47; olanzapine, N = 47) included 1 patient with diagnosed diabetes mellitus prior to onset of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong those patients under 60 years old, olanzapine patients (N = 37) experienced significantly greater increases at 1 year in all metabolic parameters than the risperidone group (N = 39), except for weight variables: triglycerides +104.8 mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +31.7 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .037); cholesterol +30.7 mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +7.2 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .004); glucose +10.8 mg/dL (olanzapine) versus +0.74 mg/dL (risperidone) (p = .030). Patients under 60 years of age with concurrent use of lithium or valproate were associated with greater weight gain in both drug groups, but this difference was statistically significant only for the olanzapine cohort. Neither weight change nor use of lithium or valproate was associated with increases in glucose or lipids among those under 60 years old for either drug.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOlanzapine therapy is associated with significantly greater increases in fasting glucose and lipid levels for nongeriatric adult patients than risperidone, and the increases are not correlated with changes in weight parameters. Appropriate monitoring of fasting glucose and serum lipid levels should be considered during extended treatment with atypical antipsychotics.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37236340", "36386987", "35910343", "34683084", "34693191", "34144444", "33307516", "31708047", "31413575", "32010353", "29637739", "29090191", "28315932", "27699909", "27123797", "26378122", "26001933", "25866526"], "label": "0"}

Although they share some in vitro properties, they differ by virtue of their chemical structure, spectrum of receptor binding affinities, animal neuropharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo neuroimaging profile. Based on such differences, it was hypothesized that the two compounds would show distinct safety and/or efficacy characteristics. To test this hypothesis, an international, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, 28-week prospective study was conducted with 339 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. Results of the study indicated that both olanzapine and risperidone were safe and effective in the management of psychotic symptoms. However, olanzapine demonstrated significantly greater efficacy in negative symptoms (Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms summary score), as well as overall response rate (> or = 40% decrease in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score). Furthermore, a statistically significantly greater proportion of the olanzapine-treated than risperidone-treated patients maintained their response at 28 weeks based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects, hyperprolactinemia, and sexual dysfunction was statistically significantly lower in olanzapine-treated than risperidone-treated patients. In addition, statistically significantly fewer adverse events were reported by olanzapine-treated patients than by their risperidone-treated counterparts. Thus, the differential preclinical profiles of these two drugs were also evident in a controlled, clinical investigation.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of sustained-release bupropion (244 subjects), a nicotine patch (244 subjects), bupropion and a nicotine patch (245 subjects), and placebo (160 subjects) for smoking cessation. Smokers with clinical depression were excluded. Treatment consisted of nine weeks of bupropion (150 mg a day for the first three days, and then 150 mg twice daily) or placebo, as well as eight weeks of nicotine-patch therapy (21 mg per day during weeks 2 through 7, 14 mg per day during week 8, and 7 mg per day during week 9) or placebo. The target day for quitting smoking was usually day 8.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe abstinence rates at 12 months were 15.6 percent in the placebo group, as compared with 16.4 percent in the nicotine-patch group, 30.3 percent in the bupropion group (P<0.001), and 35.5 percent in the group given bupropion and the nicotine patch (P<0.001). By week 7, subjects in the placebo group had gained an average of 2.1 kg, as compared with a gain of 1.6 kg in the nicotine-patch group, a gain of 1.7 kg in the bupropion group, and a gain of 1.1 kg in the combined-treatment group (P<0.05). Weight gain at seven weeks was significantly less in the combined-treatment group than in the bupropion group and the placebo group (P<0.05 for both comparisons). A total of 311 subjects (34.8 percent) discontinued one or both medications. Seventy-nine subjects stopped treatment because of adverse events: 6 in the placebo group (3.8 percent), 16 in the nicotine-patch group (6.6 percent), 29 in the bupropion group (11.9 percent), and 28 in the combined-treatment group (11.4 percent). The most common adverse events were insomnia and headache.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with sustained-release bupropion alone or in combination with a nicotine patch resulted in significantly higher long-term rates of smoking cessation than use of either the nicotine patch alone or placebo. Abstinence rates were higher with combination therapy than with bupropion alone, but the difference was not statistically significant.", "outbound_citations": ["11723080", "11270671", "11063954", "10926597", "10950214", "10775202", "10775216", "10796582", "10086962", "9888919", "9921852", "9752895", "9652667", "9554323", "8956374", "8916629", "8773818", "8799657", "8601960", "8602220", "7586342", "7665537", "7957014", "8201739", "8020458", "7904003", "8518571", "8515740", "1341599", "1401384", "2395193", "2738215", "3671317", "3954551", "3954545", "3627296", "6434084", "519268", "735910"], "inbound_citations": ["37216808", "37176513", "36898367", "36820570", "36550610", "36387983", "36293800", "36280333", "34736890", "34885905", "34938850", "34686260", "34611902", "34668482", "34505368", "34265007", "34322158", "34128281", "33903947", "33888006", "33549729", "33322962", "33257092", "32949521", "32892651", "32734299", "32684065", "32868609", "32319681", "32220607", "31866054", "31622593", "35540679", "31757519", "31578114", "31103674", "31538372", "31533544", "30816006", "31211153", "30578565", "30920255", "30614586", "30597657", "30300476", "29069464", "30092681", "29912798", "28921548", "29852054", "30018679", "29752250", "30622753", "29523670", "29382348", "29581958", "28925882", "29065193", "30296484", "28391535", "29038512", "28976393", "28848000", "28890910", "28605678", "27733658", "28150285", "28481369", "28040373", "27956009", "28255755", "28158558", "27729398", "27918881", "27928047", "27613893", "27613888", "27876411", "27839954", "27617367", "27213949", "27678347", "27539168", "26949003", "25600466", "27255113", "27467642", "27091301", "27099216", "27318988", "27181397", "27166253", "26802129", "26715118", "26704812", "27647086", "27007975", "27830625", "17874469", "27556258", "27055616", "26873019", "27799513", "25744958", "25589680", "26303184", "26507831", "26293443", "26169448", "26389650", "26330087", "26268268", "26238637", "26655050", "25970009", "25530426", "26006117", "25908730", "25866497", "24529072", "25616031"], "label": "0"}

The only other psychoactive medication allowed was lorazepam for agitation. The primary efficacy instrument was the Young Mania Rating Scale; a priori protocol-defined threshold scores were > or =20 for inclusion, < or =12 for remission, and > or = 15 for relapse.

Tyrosine 150 mg/kg, caffeine 300 mg/70 kg, phentermine 37.5 mg, d-amphetamine 20 mg and placebo were administered in a double-blind, randomized fashion to compare their effects on the time it took to fall asleep, on endocrine responses during sleep deprivation, and on sleep quantity, quality and architecture as measured by polysomnography during recovery sleep. When given after 36 h without sleep, tyrosine had no significant effect on any parameter of sleep. d-amphetamine produced marked decrease in sleep drive but caused deleterious effects on many aspects of recovery sleep. Still, d-amphetamine was associated with increased alertness on the first recovery day. Phentermine and caffeine both decreased sleep drive during sleep deprivation, but phentermine impaired rapid-eye-movement (REM) recovery sleep.

Because the stimulant medication magnesium pemoline (Cylert, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) has been found effective in treating ADHD in pediatric groups, we tested its efficacy in adults with ADHD using higher daily doses than those previously studied. We conducted a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study of pemoline at a target daily dose of 3 mg/kg per day in 35 adult patients with DSM-III-R and -IV ADHD. We used standardized structured psychiatric instruments for diagnosis. To measure improvement, we used separate assessments of ADHD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms at baseline and at each biweekly visit. ADHD outcome was determined using the ADHD symptom checklist and Clinical Global Impression scales of Severity and Improvement. Of the 35 adults with ADHD who were randomized in the trial, 27 (77%) completed the protocol. Treatment with pemoline in the final week of the 4-week active phase was best tolerated at doses substantially lower than the target dose of 3 mg/kg per day (mean dose, 2.2 mg/kg per day; mean+/-SD, 148+/-95 mg). Pemoline was significantly better at reducing ADHD symptoms compared with placebo (z = 2.4,p < 0.02). Using a predefined 30% reduction in symptoms as an indication of improvement, 50% of pemoline-treated subjects and 17% of subjects in the placebo group were considered positive responders (chi2 = 7.1, p = 0.008). These results indicate that pemoline is moderately effective in the treatment of ADHD in adults. Although robust doses were targeted, most adults preferred more moderate dosing (120-160 mg/day). Given the limited efficacy, tolerability, and concerns of hepatic dysfunction, pemoline should be considered as second-line medication for treating ADHD in adults.", "outbound_citations": ["9715357", "9585725", "8780417", "8780416", "8804131", "8626348", "9118321", "8714323", "9384944", "7616253", "7649959", "7771913", "9384909", "9384867", "8238632", "8357299", "8494063", "1564025", "2210262", "2196522", "2196146", "2303976", "2551071", "2889717", "3743405", "4037987", "4017880", "4017397", "3989165", "4089105", "6303137", "7011250", "7406656", "793563", "772696", "13688369", "14399272"], "inbound_citations": ["36794845", "35470549"], "label": "1"}

Oral guanfacine at 0.5 or 1 mg or a placebo (control) 3 hours before induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with thiamylal 5 mg/kg and vecuronium 0.2 mg/kg, and maintained with isoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide (N2O) in oxygen. The inspired isoflurane concentration was maintained at 1% during the first 5 minutes following induction of anesthesia and titrated to the concentration required to maintain hemodynamic stability [defined as +/- 10% of systolic blood pressure (SBP)]. The end-tidal concentration of isoflurane was monitored throughout anesthesia. On completion of surgery, N2O and isoflurane were discontinued. Following confirmation of recovery from anesthesia and muscle relaxation, the endotracheal tube was removed. Patients in the control group showed significant increases in SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) associated with tracheal intubation 50 +/- 5, 57 +/- 6.3, and 45 +/- 4.6 (%, mean +/- SEM, p < 0.05 for any variables), respectively.

Based on the phenomenologic and pharmacologic similarities between these rat chewing movements and human tardive dyskinesia (TD), the animal movements are often used as a model of tardive dyskinesia (TD). Here we report results of the association of oral chewing movements in rats with chronic administration of two new antipsychotic drugs, olanzapine and sertindole. Because each of these antipsychotic drugs has a very low incidence of acute Parkinsonism in human studies, they are candidates for showing a low tardive dyskinesia risk. Neither new drug produced a significant incidence of haloperidol-like chewing in rats, nor did movement ratings after their chronic administration differ from placebo; whereas, haloperidol produced a 60% prevalence of purposeless chewing and a prevalence significantly increased from placebo.

Cholinergic stimulation of the hypothalamic\u2010pituitary\u2010adrenal axis and adrenal medulla by physostigmine enhances secretion of arginine vasopressin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Because the hypothalamus is the dominant thermoregulatory controller in mammals, and these neurotransmitters may be involved in body temperature control, physostigmine administration may influence the incidence of shivering. Accordingly, the authors tested the hypothesis that physostigmine administration inhibits postanesthetic shivering. Its efficacy was compared with that of saline (negative control) and meperidine and clonidine (positive controls). Methods Sixty patients having surgery of the ear or nose were tested. General anesthesia was induced with 2 mg/kg propofol, 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, and 1.5 micro gram/kg fentanyl and maintained with isoflurane (1.5 +/\u2010 0.4%) in 70% nitrous oxide. At the end of surgery, the patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous bolus of 0.04 mg/kg physostigmine, isotonic saline, 0.5 mg/kg meperidine, or 1.5 micro gram/kg clonidine. Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, visual analog pain score, temperature, and postanesthetic shivering were measured during recovery. Results Postanesthetic shivering occurred in 6 of 15 (40%) patients given saline. In contrast, postanesthetic shivering was significantly reduced in physostigmine\u2010treated patients (1 of 15, or 7%) and was absent in patients given clonidine or meperidine. Conclusions Physostigmine inhibited shivering as well as did two established treatments, meperidine and clonidine. These data suggest that cholinergic systems contribute to the genesis and control of postanesthetic shivering.", "outbound_citations": ["9052312", "8764619", "8725470", "8684510", "7631951", "8267194", "8251281", "8363071", "8363079", "1610573", "1766097", "1785240", "1928769", "2139880", "2742149", "2675888", "3237736", "3377231", "2900756", "3110318", "3561772", "3018822", "3766092", "2939779", "3526790", "6730873", "7066140", "7094436", "7188667", "469725", "589507", "4840853", "5146824", "5485136", "5639802"], "inbound_citations": ["33682037", "29364538", "27856931", "27687359", "27632391", "27756210", "26775126", "27275057", "26256531"], "label": "0"}

Even single doses may have long-term harmful effects. To determine whether these medications have a similar negative impact in humans, we analyzed the recoveries of control patients who were enrolled in the Sygen in Acute Stroke Study, a multicenter study of the effects of GM1 ganglioside after ischemic stroke. Motor impairments were measured by the motor subscores of the Toronto Stroke Scale at baseline and 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 84 days after stroke. Using these data, we compared motor recovery between patients with initial motor deficits who received at least one of the drugs that interfere with recovery in laboratory studies (\u201cdetrimental\u201d drug group, n = 37) and patients who did not receive these drugs (\u201cneutral\u201d drug group, n = 59). The groups were well balanced with regard to the frequency of comorbid conditions and other prognostic factors. For upper-extremity motor function, repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant interaction between drug group and time after stroke [F(6,528) = 2.38; p = 0.031, with a significant (p < 0.001) difference between the groups beginning 7 days after the stroke. A similar trend was present for the lower extremity, but the overall difference between the groups was not significant [ANOVA F(6,498) = 1.22; p = 0.29]. Drug group did influence the degree of independence in activities of daily living as measured with the Barthel Index. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant interaction between drug group and time after stroke [F(5,420) = 3.35; p = 0.0061, with a significant (p 5 0.002) difference between the groups 56 and 84 days after stroke. Stepwise regression analyses incorporating other potential prognostic factors indicated that drug group independently influenced both the degree of upper-extremity motor impairment and independence in activities of daily living 84 days after stroke.

After surgery the incidence and severity of agitation was measured during an observation period of 2 h. Severe agitation was treated with midazolam. In 16 placebo and 2 clonidine-treated patients agitation was observed (P < 0.001). In 6 patients of the Placebo group, agitation was graded as severe, whereas none of the patients in the Clonidine group developed severe agitation (P = 0.02).

Two hypotheses were tested: (1) whether ADHD is associated with diminished prepulse inhibition during attended prestimuli, but not ignored prestimuli, and (2) whether methylphenidate selectively increases prepulse inhibition to attended prestimuli among boys with ADHD. Participants were 17 boys with ADHD and 14 controls. Participants completed a tone discrimination task in each of two sessions separated by 1 week. ADHD boys were administered methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg) in one session and placebo in the other session in a randomized, double-blind fashion. During each series of 72 tones (75 dB; half 1200-Hz, half 400-Hz), participants were paid to attend to one pitch and ignore the other. Bilateral eyeblink electromyogram startle responses were recorded in response to acoustic probes (50-ms, 102-dB white noise) presented following the onset of two-thirds of tones, and during one-third of intertrial intervals. Relative to controls, boys with ADHD exhibited diminished prepulse inhibition 120 ms after onset of attended but not ignored prestimuli following placebo administration. Methylphenidate selectively increased prepulse inhibition to attended prestimuli at 120 ms among boys with ADHD to a level comparable to that of controls, who did not receive methylphenidate. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that ADHD involves diminished selective attention and suggest that methylphenidate ameliorates the symptoms of ADHD, at least in part, by altering an early attentional mechanism.", "outbound_citations": ["3131796", "12236335", "12212652", "11952190", "11764019", "11431228", "11389303", "11518092", "11160455", "11099759", "11084215", "10934899", "10860411", "10830463", "10638065", "10705762", "10450262", "10367557", "10066996", "9766762", "9700516", "9671677", "9648036", "9608351", "9529945", "9505132", "9093895", "9234034", "9009815", "9000892", "8851242", "8719124", "7784535", "8040490", "8282934", "8218613", "1410175", "1564021", "2405807", "3597291", "7433993", "7406657", "670589", "1153628"], "inbound_citations": ["37014483", "35757214", "34534624", "32126243", "32158972", "30873927", "30940478", "30873927", "29733106", "29744873", "29853848", "28578923", "28579490", "28406942", "28401360", "27440761", "26852138"], "label": "0"}

In 36 of 51 patients who accepted the procedure, an epidural catheter was inserted (L 1 -L 2 level). General anesthesia was induced with propofol and sufentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane in O 2 /N 2 O. After emergence from anesthesia, epidural analgesia was initiated according to two randomly assigned protocols: 1 mg of morphine with 75 &mgr;g of clonidine (Group M) or 12.5 mg of bupivacaine with 75 &mgr;g of clonidine (Group B), in 10 mL saline. Piritramide was administered during the first postoperative 24 hours using a patient-controlled analgesia device (PCA). The following parameters were recorded: piritramide consumption during the first 24 hours; pain at rest during the first postoperative hours (D0), during the first night (D1), and during the first mobilization; [visual analogue scale (VAS)]; and the occurrence of drowsiness, motor blockade, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, itching, micturition problems, and bladder catheterization during D0 and D1. Epidural administration of morphine-clonidine significantly improved postoperative pain relief and reduced piritramide consumption as compared to epidural bupivacaine-clonidine. Side effects did not differ between groups except for a higher incidence of micturition problems in Group M during D1. The occurrence of bladder catheterization was not significantly higher in that group. We conclude that a low dose of epidural morphine combined with clonidine offers a better postoperative analgesia than does bupivacaine-clonidine. The excellent analgesic conditions were obtained at the expense of a higher incidence of difficulties in initiating micturition.", "outbound_citations": ["9007884", "10910855", "10691217", "10515023", "9212136", "7643992", "7479660", "8485789", "8433138", "3345002", "7200737", "6779255"], "inbound_citations": ["31308262", "28913452", "25680636"], "label": "0"}

Therefore, other treatments need to be considered. Subtle changes in cholinergic function in schizophrenic patients provide the rationale to test the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors in treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Given this, a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil (5 mg and 10 mg) as adjunctive treatment to risperidone was conducted in a total of 36 schizophrenic patients. Neither the 5-mg nor 10-mg dose of donepezil produced significant improvements in any cognitive measure compared with placebo. It is possible that nicotinic receptor desensitization produced by chronic tobacco use in these patients rendered their nicotinic receptors refractory to the effects of increased agonist activity produced by donepezil.

Further, our data suggest that clozapine should not be reserved for the most chronically ill patients, but rather be utilized in patients with less chronic courses of schizophrenia.

The study was designed to investigate the effects of the combined subarachnoid administration of clonidine and prilocaine on spinal block and postoperative analgesia for the transurethral resection of tumours in the urinary bladder.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe controlled, prospective, double-blind study enrolled 40 patients scheduled for elective transurethral resection of bladder tumours under spinal anaesthesia with prilocaine. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an intrathecal injection of prilocaine 75 mg alone (control group) or in combination with clonidine 75 micrograms. We assessed haemodynamic changes (non-invasive arterial pressure, heart rate), pulse oximetry, the upper level of block, the onset and duration of sensory and motor block, postoperative analgesia and any adverse effects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no statistically significant differences in demographic data, heart rate, onset time or the levels of sensory or motor block. Analgesia lasted significantly longer in the clonidine group (498.4 +/- 226.9 versus 187.2 +/- 103.1 min; P < 0.05). The duration of motor block was longer in the clonidine group (165.5 +/- 30.6 min) than in the control group (139.7 +/- 40.4 min; P < 0.05) and the duration of sensory block was also longer in the clonidine group (157.3 +/- 24.5 min) than in the control group (137.2 +/- 31.2 min; P < 0.05). Fewer patients in the recovery room needed metamizol (dipyrone) in the clonidine group (5%) than in the control group (50%). Arterial pressure decreased significantly in the clonidine group 75-135 min after the block.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe addition of clonidine 75 micrograms to prilocaine 75 mg for subarachnoid anaesthesia increased the duration of sensory and motor block and reduced the need for additional postoperative analgesics by providing excellent analgesia for about 8 h during recovery from transurethral resection of bladder tumours.", "outbound_citations": ["1371023", "11388543", "10757577", "10342005", "9380285", "9059110", "8853097", "8712447", "8679366", "7793648", "7856901", "7818120", "7978435", "8067231", "1642346", "2059129", "2765348"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Participants also completed daily and weekly questionnaires concerning sexual functioning, and a team of investigators rated various dimensions of sexual function every 2 weeks. In addition, a variety of physiologic measures, relevant either to erectile function or to neural/vascular systems that underlie sexual response, were assessed during baseline and bupropion treatment. Results indicated that neither subjective nor objective measures of erectile and overall sexual functioning worsened during bupropion. In fact, several measures suggested a trend toward improved sexual functioning. Furthermore, diabetic control was unaffected by bupropion administration. Given the lack of adverse effects on sexual function, along with the potential for improved erectile response, bupropion may provide an attractive choice for the treatment of depression in diabetic men or others for whom sexual dysfunction is a concern.", "outbound_citations": ["9015579", "7500370", "7929021", "7951639", "8276736", "8285844", "1564046", "1869603", "2390706", "2927481", "2712681", "2904224", "3122698", "2883173", "3121861", "2951205", "3919069", "3908695", "7139997", "7036493", "7356227", "729829", "1247127", "1127805", "5558648", "5903579"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

In the risperidone group, reductions from baseline in scores for the percentage of syllables stuttered, time stuttering as a percentage of total time speaking, and overall stuttering severity were significant (p < 0.01); changes in scores on the fourth measure of stuttering, duration, were not significant. No significant decreases occurred in the placebo group. Among the eight patients in the risperidone group, five responded best to 0.5 mg/day, with stuttering recurring at higher doses. The remaining three patients responded better with increasing doses of risperidone. Risperidone was generally well tolerated.

Sixty consenting patients, scheduled for total abdominal hysterectomy, were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 20 each); the clonidine-morphine group received oral clonidine 5 microg/kg 90 min before arriving in the operating room and epidural morphine 2 mg before induction of general anesthesia, the clonidine-placebo group received oral clonidine 5 microg/kg and no epidural morphine, and the placebo-morphine group received no clonidine and epidural morphine 2 mg. An epidural catheter was placed at the L1-2 or L2-3 interspace, and 1.5% lidocaine was used for surgical anesthesia in all patients. General anesthesia was then induced with propofol, and maintained with a continuous infusion of propofol and 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen during surgery. Four patients were subsequently withdrawn from the study. After surgery, patient-controlled analgesia using IV morphine was used to assess analgesic requirement. Morphine consumptions determined every 6 h after surgery in the clonidine-morphine and placebo-morphine groups were significantly less than the clonidine-placebo group until 12 h after surgery, whereas those of the clonidine-morphine group were significantly less than the placebo-morphine group from 13 to 42 h after surgery. Visual analog (pain) scale (VAS) scores in the clonidine-morphine group were significantly lower than the placebo-morphine group at 48 h at rest, and at 1, 24, 36, and 48 h with movement. Similarly, VAS scores in the clonidine-morphine group were significantly lower than the clonidine-placebo group at 1 and 6 h both at rest and with movement, whereas VAS scores in the clonidine-placebo group were significantly lower than the placebo-morphine group at 24, 36, and 48 h at rest and with movement. The incidence of nausea and pruritus was similar between groups. We conclude that the combination of oral clonidine and epidural morphine produces more potent and longer lasting postoperative analgesia than either drug alone without increasing the incidence of adverse effects after major gynecologic surgeries.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nA small dose of epidural morphine is often used for postoperative analgesia. We found that oral clonidine premedication 5 microg/kg improves the analgesic efficacy of epidural morphine without increasing the incidence of adverse side effects.", "outbound_citations": ["10215710", "8874906", "8853097", "8638790", "7788826", "7802307", "7916547", "7639361", "8198904", "7727330", "8102063", "1672060", "1990896", "2262895", "1978990", "3293868", "418952", "1245090"], "inbound_citations": ["35694199", "35215326", "31107108", "28973650", "29596102", "28715610"], "label": "0"}

Efficacy was assessed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Change Version (which contains the Mania Rating Scale), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity scale, CGI improvement scale, and Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. Primary efficacy variables were differences from baseline to endpoint (last observation carried forward) in mean Mania Rating Scale and CGI severity scale scores between the ziprasidone and placebo groups. Safety evaluations included monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram results, and clinical laboratory values and assessment of movement disorders and akathisia.\n\n\nRESULTS\nZiprasidone produced rapid, sustained improvements relative to baseline and placebo on all primary and most secondary efficacy measures at endpoint. Significant improvements were typically observed within 2 days after treatment commenced and were maintained throughout the 3 weeks.

A total of 197 alcohol-dependent patients, diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (third revised edition) with a daily ethanol intake of 60 g, were allocated randomly to one of the following regimens which were commenced on admission to the ICU: flunitrazepam-clonidine, chlormethiazole-haloperidol, flunitrazepam-haloperidol or ethanol. The duration of ICU stay, prevention of AWS, incidence of tracheobronchitis and major intercurrent complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, cardiac disorders, bleeding disorders and death were documented. On admission, patients did not differ significantly in age, APACHE II and multiple organ failure scores. ICU stay, incidence of AWS, severity of AWS (revised clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol scale > 20) and major intercurrent complication rate did not differ significantly between groups.

We assessed striatal DA D2 receptor occupancy by olanzapine and risperidone in 36 young patients [31 males, 5 females; mean age 21.1 years (16-28)] with first episode schizophrenia, using [123I]iodobenzamide (IBZM) SPECT. The occupancy of DA D2 receptors was not significantly different between olanzapine and risperidone. However, in subgroups of most prescribed doses, DA D2 occupancy was higher in the risperidone 4-mg group (79%) compared to the olanzapine 15-mg group (62%). [123I]IBZM binding ratios decreased with olanzapine dose (r = -0.551; P < 0.01), indicating higher DA D2 receptor occupancy with higher olanzapine dose. Akathisia and positive symptoms were correlated with [123I]IBZM binding ratio (r = -0.442; P < 0.01; and r = -0.360; P < 0.05, respectively). Prolactin (PRL) levels were elevated in the risperidone, but not in the olanzapine group, at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels. In the olanzapine group, PRL levels were correlated with [123I]IBZM binding ratio (r = -0.551; P < 0.01). In conclusion, both olanzapine and risperidone induce a high striatal D2 receptor occupancy, dependent on dose and group formation. The lower incidence of prolactin elevation with olanzapine, compared to risperidone, may not be attributed to a lower D2 receptor occupancy.", "outbound_citations": ["9989565", "9952042", "9734543", "9926100", "9667606", "9659858", "9669383", "9619147", "9510228", "9577837", "9326746", "9351491", "9298513", "9184614", "9122236", "9061054", "9000645", "8981383", "9027930", "8799184", "8822531", "8822534", "7543969", "7545060", "7514366", "7973452", "8254390", "1352677", "1381102", "1838141", "1839302", "1968328", "2574607", "3249784", "3616518", "444788", "4917967", "13667431"], "inbound_citations": ["30281999", "28486094", "27810775"], "label": "0"}

A dose-response relationship for IM olanzapine in the reduction of agitation was assessed by measuring the reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC) scores 2 hours after the first injection. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events and with extrapyramidal symptom scales and electrocardiograms at 24 hours after the first injection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOlanzapine exhibited a dose-response relationship for reduction in agitation (F(1,179)= 14.4; P<.001). Mean PANSS-EC reductions 2 hours after the first injection of olanzapine (2.5 mg = -5.5; 5.0 mg = -8.1; 7.5 mg = -8.7; 10.0 mg = -9.4) were superior to those with placebo (-2.9; P =.01 vs olanzapine at 2.5 mg; P<.001 for each other olanzapine dose) but not with haloperidol (-7.5). A dose of 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 mg of olanzapine caused a greater reduction in agitation than placebo 30 minutes after the first injection. There were no differences between treatment groups for hypotension, the most frequently reported adverse event, or for clinically relevant changes in the QTc interval. There was a greater incidence of treatment-emergent parkinsonism during treatment with IM haloperidol (16.7%) than with 2.5 (P =.03), 5.0 (P =.03), or 7.5 mg (P =.01) of IM olanzapine (0%) or with placebo (0%) (P =.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIntramuscular olanzapine at a dose of 2.5 to 10.0 mg per injection exhibits a dose-response relationship in the rapid treatment of acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia and demonstrates a favorable safety profile.", "outbound_citations": ["12558541", "11005704", "10744090", "10372605", "10622686", "10623971", "10577870", "10440006", "9754846", "9202880", "9184614", "9169300", "9265911", "8947998", "8947999", "8712033", "8778684", "8941170", "8540577", "8866772", "7656507", "7916523", "1352166", "1864567", "2287938", "2572206", "2611552", "2574607", "3389986", "2892478", "2887552", "3597810", "3805340", "7011249", "7216345", "7457966", "961933", "17894080", "4917967", "13685365", "13655060"], "inbound_citations": ["37031523", "36594857", "35913401", "35833454", "35774721", "34825897", "34950067", "34824958", "34390232", "34338130", "34408419", "33607608", "33505819", "33424498", "32690072", "32336335", "32059065", "32031021", "30721802", "30843960", "30540028", "30293014", "30282677", "29885904", "29915922", "30175524", "29719399", "29862236", "29395692", "29433934", "29361326", "29391799", "29308601", "28758203", "28807142", "28335913", "28638198", "27461399", "27151529", "27307984", "27284637", "26912127", "26749342", "26228420", "26118921", "26090227", "25808074", "25500684", "25791540", "25395689"], "label": "0"}

Multiple open-label studies have reported that treatment with clozapine at low doses ameliorates psychosis without worsening parkinsonism.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low doses of clozapine (6.25 to 50 mg per day) in 60 patients at six sites over a period of 14 months. The patients (mean age, 72 years) had idiopathic Parkinson's disease and drug-induced psychosis of at least four weeks' duration. All the patients continued to receive fixed doses of antiparkinsonian drugs during the four weeks of the trial. Blood counts were monitored weekly in all the patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean dose of clozapine was 24.7 mg per day. The patients in the clozapine group had significantly more improvement than those in the placebo group in all three of the measures used to determine the severity of psychosis. The mean (+/-SE) scores on the Clinical Global Impression Scale improved by 1.6+/-0.3 points for the patients receiving clozapine, as compared with 0.5+/-0.2 point for those receiving placebo (P<0.001). The score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale improved by 9.3+/-1.5 points for the patients receiving clozapine, as compared with 2.6+/-1.3 points for those receiving placebo (P=0.002). The score on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms improved by 11.8+/-2.0 points for the patients receiving clozapine, as compared with 3.8+/-1.9 points for those receiving placebo (P=0.01). Seven patients treated with clozapine had an improvement of at least three on the seven-point Clinical Global Impression Scale, as compared with only one patient given placebo. Clozapine treatment improved tremor and had no deleterious effect on the severity of parkinsonism. In one patient, clozapine was discontinued because of leukopenia.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nClozapine, at daily doses of 50 mg or less, is safe and significantly improves drug-induced psychosis without worsening parkinsonism.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37274140", "36847017", "36280256", "36339313", "36184862", "36186499", "36211804", "35879841", "35906500", "35786651", "35696620", "35694936", "35574992", "35466847", "35479873", "35029864", "35087470", "35010624", "34480885", "34291590", "34356654", "34219522", "34073269", "33392826", "33183105", "33048274", "32755800", "32662076", "32514891", "32439027", "32480308", "32498499", "32213570", "31733691", "32004527", "33681781", "31603988", "31759870", "31351976", "31006550", "31551655", "31241368", "30794329", "31159608", "30924099", "30848989", "30725186", "30398127", "31753136", "31727232", "30848989", "30588905", "29953902", "30443669", "30387904", "30004964", "29969592", "30076270", "30065280", "30054321", "30027401", "30155398", "30072306", "29523699", "29452684", "29494265", "28882428", "29497575", "29374325", "29047301", "29090594", "28831734", "29247391", "29305656", "29098976", "29955532", "29093347", "28817967", "28622212", "28416136", "28636480", "28482941", "28385039", "28272787", "29185542", "27719624", "28087061", "28375643", "28106066", "28130646", "28802934", "27830568", "27800022", "27609312", "27629356", "27591014", "30363521", "27502301", "27504054", "27312429", "26908168", "27056066", "26949843", "30363578", "26377851", "26646536"], "label": "0"}

Twenty-nine patients (8.0 \u00b1 4.0 years old) with cerebral palsy and ADHD completed the study. In a prospective, crossover, double-blind paradigm, patients were treated with methylphenidate or placebo, each for 4 weeks. Parents and teachers completed a modified Abbreviated Conners' Rating Scale at the beginning of the study and the end of the first and second months of treatment with methylphenidate or placebo. Parents were contacted weekly to report side effects. Methylphenidate treatment, as assessed by teachers' ratings, resulted in a significant improvement in ADHD symptomatology ( t = 2.29, df = 27, P < .05); however, a trend for improvement was noted only on the parents' ratings. After the conclusion of the study, 12 patients continued methylphenidate for 20 \u00b1 10 months. Side effects were minimal, with the exception of transient hallucinations in one patient. In children with cerebral palsy and ADHD, methylphenidate is effective, rendering it a valuable adjunct to their overall medical therapy.

The segmental distribution of clonidine epidural analgesia and its effects on temporal summation and different types of noxious stimuli are unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify these issues. Methods: Fifteen healthy volunteers received epidurally (L2\u2010L3 or L3\u2010L4) 20 ml of either epinephrine, 100 micro gram, in saline; clonidine, 8 micro gram/kg, in saline; or saline, 0.9%, alone, on three different days in a randomized, double\u2010blind, cross\u2010over fashion. Pain rating after electrical stimulation, pinprick, and cold perception were recorded on the dermatomes S1, L4, L1, T9, T6, T1, and forehead. Pressure pain tolerance threshold was recorded at S1, T6, and ear. Pain thresholds to single and repeated (temporal summation) electrical stimulation of the sural nerve were determined. Results: Epinephrine significantly reduced sensitivity to pinprick at L1\u2010L4\u2010S1. Clonidine significantly decreased pain rating after electrical stimulation at L1\u2010L4 and sensitivity to pinprick and cold at L1\u2010L4\u2010S1, increased pressure pain tolerance threshold at S1, and increased thresholds after single and repeated stimulation of the sural nerve. Conclusions: Epidural epinephrine and clonidine produce segmental hypoalgesia. Clonidine bolus should be administered at a spinal level corresponding to the painful area. Clonidine inhibits temporal summation elicited by repeated electrical stimulation and may therefore attenuate spinal cord hyperexcitability.", "outbound_citations": ["9059212", "8881619", "8694379", "8740605", "8740612", "7486097", "7486158", "7577294", "7573998", "7547042", "7598284", "7726426", "7854795", "7547655", "7816492", "7681556", "8093828", "8439023", "1466216", "1768538", "1672060", "2817456", "2780075", "2487934", "3354801", "3037026", "2878134", "2861606", "3995339", "6146793", "6322616", "6829960", "6110767", "4637957", "15414611"], "inbound_citations": ["35836037", "35659953", "35027171", "33964196", "34178522", "33240944", "28818462"], "label": "0"}

In preclinical studies, ziprasidone was predicted to have efficacy against positive, negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia with a favourable tolerability profile, including a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal adverse effects. The drug has been administered orally to >300 patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in published 4- to 6-week randomised, double-blind trials. When given twice daily at dosages of between 80 and 160 mg/day, ziprasidone produced significantly greater improvements in overall symptomatology than placebo. In the largest study, ziprasidone 80 or 160 mg/day was also significantly more effective than placebo in reducing negative symptoms and, at 160 mg/day, was significantly more effective than placebo in improving depressive symptoms in patients with associated clinically significant depression. Data from a 4-week trial indicate that ziprasidone 160 mg/day has similar efficacy to haloperidol 15 mg/day. Ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day was more effective than placebo with respect to prevention of impending relapse and improvement of negative symptoms in 294 stable patients with chronic schizophrenia who were treated for up to 1 year. In addition, significantly more ziprasidone than haloperidol recipients achieved a negative symptom response in a 28-week study involving 301 stable patients with chronic or subchronic schizophrenia. In general, oral ziprasidone is well tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. Importantly, the drug has a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a negligible effect on bodyweight. Ziprasidone is associated with slight prolongation of the QTc interval; the clinical significance of this is not yet clear. The drug does not appear to be associated with sustained elevation of plasma prolactin levels. Preliminary data indicate that long-term oral ziprasidone treatment is well tolerated. Ziprasidone is the only novel antipsychotic currently available in a rapid-acting intramuscular formulation. Short-term treatment with intramuscular ziprasidone was effective and well tolerated in patients with acute agitation associated with psychosis. In addition, intramuscular ziprasidone reduced agitation scores by a significantly greater extent than haloperidol in a study involving patients with acute agitation associated with psychosis. Ziprasidone is a promising new antipsychotic that has shown significant efficacy in the oral treatment of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The drug is well tolerated with a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a negligible effect on bodyweight. In addition, intramuscular ziprasidone shows efficacy and good tolerability in the treatment of acute agitation associated with psychotic disorders.", "outbound_citations": ["11691681", "11401000", "11235922", "11160792", "11206599", "12847582", "10771448", "10771449", "10771453", "10771458", "10771457", "10771452", "10771454", "10771455", "10771451", "10192829", "9860108", "9690695", "9430133", "9469675", "8930203", "10771456", "7562537", "1679253", "2571717", "2576319", "2872945", "8935809", "7530377", "7871035", "10771450"], "inbound_citations": ["29915922", "26417330", "21861822", "21177241", "18004132", "17143078", "17465637", "16965192", "16816018", "16167302", "15933479", "15726858", "15538989", "15228634", "15103698"], "label": "0"}

Such patients are more likely to have a greater resistance or intolerance to treatment, thus restricting our interpretation of the impact a new treatment might have on the course of schizophrenia and possibly biasing the results. The present study examines the relative effectiveness of risperidone and typical antipsychotics in patients being treated for their first episode of schizophrenia.\n\n\nMETHOD\nFrom a cohort of 126 patients, 2 groups of 19 first-episode DSM-III-R/DSM-IV schizophrenia patients matched for age, gender, length of illness, and length of treatment and treated with either a typical antipsychotic or risperidone for a minimum of 1 year were compared on a number of outcome dimensions during their course of treatment and at follow-up. Treatment allocation was not random, and patients were judged to be compliant with medication. Patients treated with typical antipsychotics were followed up for a statistically nonsignificantly longer time (mean = 2.7 vs. 1.9 years).\n\n\nRESULTS\nSix patients (31.6%) from the typical antipsychotic group were admitted to the hospital within the first year following the index admission compared with 1 patient (5.3%) in the risperidone group (admitted at month 14). Patients in the risperidone group showed a statistically significantly lower length of first hospitalization (p < .01), utilization of inpatient beds during the course of treatment (p < .001), and use of anticholinergic medication (p < .05). There were no statistically significant differences in symptom levels, either during the course of treatment or at follow-up; in the use of antidepressant, antianxiety, or mood-stabilizing drugs; or in changes in living circumstances or employment.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese findings confirm at least equal long-term efficacy of typical antipsychotics and risperidone, but a possible advantage for risperidone in decreased service utilization and decreased use of anticholinergic drugs.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Hemodynamic variables, oxygen saturation, and levels of sedation, as well as the time required to achieve surgical block and time to first analgesic request, were recorded by a blinded observer. Time to surgical blockade required 10 min in both groups. Patients in the Ropivacaine-Clonidine group were more sedated than patients in the Ropivacaine group only 10 min after block placement. No differences in oxygen saturation and hemodynamic variables, degree of pain measured at first analgesic request, and consumption of postoperative analgesics were observed between the two groups. The mean time from block placement to first request for pain medication was shorter in group Ropivacaine (13.7 h; 25th\u201375th percentiles: 11.8\u201314.5 h) than in group Ropivacaine-Clonidine (16.8 h; 25th\u201375th percentiles: 13.5\u201317.8 h) (P = 0.038).

The study consisted of 35 females diagnosed with schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4(th) ed. (DSM-IV). Thirty-five patients in a drug-free period for at least 2 weeks were included to randomized quetiapine (n = 18) and haloperidol (n = 17) treatment group. All patients were assessed by Brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), Positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), and Extrapyramidal symptoms rating scale (ESRS). PRL levels were measured both at the beginning and at the sixth week of the study. Both treatment groups exhibited significant improvements in clinical signs as evaluated by BPRS and PANSS. While there was no significant difference in PRL level between groups at the beginning of the study, control prolactin (PRL) levels were significantly lower in quetiapine compared to haloperidol group. While no quetiapine group patients exhibited galactorrhea, we observed that two patients from the haloperidol group had galactorrhea related to hyperprolactinemia.

Before anesthesia, an epidural catheter was inserted at the L1-L2 interspace. At induction of anesthesia, the patients received epidurally either clonidine (4 micro gram/kg in 10 mL) infused in 20 min followed by a 2-micro gram centered dot kg-1 centered dot h-1 infusion (5 mL/h) during 12 h (Group 1) or sufentanil (0.5 micro gram/kg in 10 mL) in 20 min followed by a 0.25-micro gram centered dot kg-1 centered dot h-1 infusion (5 mL/h) during 12 h (Group 2). Intraoperatively, increases in arterial blood pressure and heart rate not responding to propofol bolus (0.5 mg/kg) were treated with a bolus of intravenous (IV) sufentanil 0.035 micro gram/kg. Postoperatively, IV sufentanil boluses (5 micro gram) were given through a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device. Postoperative analgesia was assessed by recording the IV PCA sufentanil requirements and the patients' visual analog scale (VAS) at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 h. Sedation analog scales and side effects were also recorded. Plasma clonidine and sufentanil concentrations were measured after 20 min and 6, 12, and 24 h. The number of reinjections of propofol (n = 1.6 +/- 1.6 in Group 1 vs 6.5 +/- 4.0 in Group 2) and of IV sufentanil (n = 0.6 +/- 0.8 in Group 1 vs 3.8 +/- 3.7 in Group 2) was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) in the epidural clonidine group. In the early post-operative period, pain scores and rescue analgesic requirements were very low in both groups. After discontinuation of the epidural infusions, reduced PCA requirements and the better VAS scores were still noted in Group 1 (80.5 +/- 55.7 micro gram IV sufentanil in Group 1 vs 142 +/- 87 micro gram in Group 2; P < 0.05). There was no difference in sedation scores. Epidural clonidine and sufentanil only moderately affected heart rate and blood pressure. Two instances of awareness in Group 1 and one episode of respiratory depression in Group 2 were reported. Epidural clonidine improved intraoperative hemodynamic stability when compared with epidural sufentanil. Both substances provided reliable postoperative analgesia. A longer lasting residual analgesic effect was demonstrated after the use of epidural clonidine. Both substances showed different but potentially worrying side effects.

The ability of alpha2 \u2010adrenoceptor agonists to inhibit central sympathetic outflow may benefit patients with coronary artery disease by increasing the myocardial oxygen supply\u2010and\u2010demand ratio. Methods A randomized double\u2010blind study design was used in 297 patients scheduled to have elective vascular surgical procedures to evaluate the effects of 2 micro gram/kg sup \u20101 oral clonidine (n = 145) or placebo (n = 152) on the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemic episodes, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death. Continuous real\u2010time S\u2010T segment trend analysis (lead II and V5) was performed during anesthesia and surgery and correlated with arterial blood pressure and heart rate before and during ischemic events. Dose requirements for vasoactive and antiischemic drugs to control blood pressure and heart rate as well as episodes of myocardial ischemia (i.e., catecholamines, beta\u2010adrenoceptor antagonists, nitrates, and systemic vasodilators) and fluid volume load were recorded. Results Administration of clonidine reduced the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemic episodes from 39% (59 of 152) to 24% (35 of 145) (P < 0.01). Hemodynamic patterns, percentage of ischemic time, and the number of ischemic episodes per patient did not differ. Nonfatal myocardial infarction developed after operation in four patients receiving placebo compared with none receiving clonidine (day 2 to 21; P = 0.07). The incidence of fatal cardiac events (1 vs. 2) was not different. Dose requirements for vasoactive and antiischemic drugs did not differ between the groups, but the amount of presurgical fluid volume was slightly greater in patients receiving clonidine (951 +/\u2010 388 vs. 867 +/\u2010 381 ml; P < 0.03).

We describe the results of the open-label extension from one of these trials.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIn a 3-week, double-blind study of patients with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder, olanzapine was superior to placebo for the treatment of acute manic symptoms. Of the 139 patients who entered the double-blind phase of the 3-week study, 113 patients continued into the 49-week open-label extension. Efficacy measurements including the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21), the Clinical Global Impressions scale-Bipolar Version, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and safety measurements including the Simpson-Angus scale, the Barnes Akathisia Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were completed throughout. The analysis considered all treatment results, starting with the first olanzapine dose. Adjunctive lithium and fluoxetine were allowed during the open-label extension.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean length of olanzapine treatment was 6.6 months, with a mean modal dose of 13.9 mg/day. A significant mean improvement in the YMRS total score, baseline to endpoint (-18.01, p < .001), was observed. During treatment, 88.3% of patients experienced a remission of manic symptoms (YMRS total score < or =12), and only 25.5% subsequently relapsed (YMRS total score > or = 15). Significant improvement in HAM-D-21 scores was observed (p < .001). Forty-one percent of patients were maintained on olanzapine monotherapy. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events reported were somnolence (46.0%), depression (38.9%), and weight gain (36.3%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDuring up to 1 year of olanzapine therapy, either as monotherapy or in combination with lithium and/or fluoxetine, patients with bipolar disorder demonstrated significant improvement in mania and depression symptoms with a favorable safety profile.

We were therefore interested in assessing whether modafinil, with its unique pharmacological mode of action, might offer similar potential as a cognitive enhancer, without the side effects commonly experienced with amphetamine-like drugs. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the cognitive enhancing potential of this novel agent using a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Sixty healthy young adult male volunteers received either a single oral dose of placebo, or 100 mg or 200 mg modafinil prior to performing a variety of tasks designed to test memory and attention. A randomised double-blind, between-subjects design was used. Modafinil significantly enhanced performance on tests of digit span, visual pattern recognition memory, spatial planning and stop-signal reaction time. These performance improvements were complemented by a slowing in latency on three tests: delayed matching to sample, a decision-making task and the spatial planning task. Subjects reported feeling more alert, attentive and energetic on drug. The effects were not clearly dose dependent, except for those seen with the stop-signal paradigm. In contrast to previous findings with methylphenidate, there were no significant effects of drug on spatial memory span, spatial working memory, rapid visual information processing or attentional set-shifting. Additionally, no effects on paired associates learning were identified. These data indicate that modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance. This improvement may be attributable to an enhanced ability to inhibit pre-potent responses. This effect appears to reduce impulsive responding, suggesting that modafinil may be of benefit in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.", "outbound_citations": ["11981223", "11390298", "11222668", "11325419", "11211372", "11862356", "10923755", "11106312", "10767651", "10757254", "11191692", "10550499", "10550486", "10525751", "10430832", "9708845", "9549666", "9377538", "9426889", "9270575", "9201809", "9106280", "8977135", "8943072", "10607161", "7480441", "7731533", "7701191", "7951684", "7991954", "7916137", "7984295", "1359924", "1629849", "1676498", "2267054", "1973114", "2303798", "2681316", "3382917"], "inbound_citations": ["36993597", "36831818", "36436400", "36396622", "36211589", "35471613", "35366192", "35150243", "35081158", "35229937", "35054255", "34907284", "34632515", "34630182", "34455764", "34909030", "34102508", "34121988", "33963883", "33774366", "33617635", "33024436", "32709551", "32525422", "32360693", "31995813", "31951804", "31419329", "31425678", "31749654", "31433334", "31357524", "30556731", "31143939", "30710391", "31037409", "31103786", "30343822", "30429456", "30410536", "32934539", "29963873", "29904123", "29726022", "29649498", "29511808", "29406017", "29937945", "29126981", "29332255", "29230168", "28774856", "28629964", "28712363", "28525569", "28464963", "28529875", "27928893", "28119083", "28299368", "27649777", "27836708", "26468077", "27421894", "27094721", "26900651", "26520004", "27043232", "27025299", "26912213", "26925027", "26708317", "26654280", "25716122", "27646012"], "label": "0"}

Subjects were randomly divided into two groups (minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration [MAC]-Awake group, n = 40; MAC-Tetanus group, n = 40). Each patient received one dose of clonidine from 1 to 5 microg/kg orally, 100 min before arrival at the operating room. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen and air. Before tracheal intubation, end-tidal sevoflurane was decreased stepwise by 0.2% at the start of 1.2%, a verbal command was given to the patients, and MAC-awake was determined in each patient. We also investigated MAC-tetanus, determined with transcutaneous electric tetanic stimulations, after tracheal intubation in each patient by observing the motor response to a transcutaneous electric tetanic stimulus to the ulnar nerve at a sevoflurane concentration decreased stepwise by 0.25% at the start of 2.75%. The initial reduction in MAC-tetanus was not as steep as that in MAC-awake. Clonidine reduced MAC-tetanus by 40% at the maximal dose of 5 microg/kg, whereas MAC-awake was already reduced by 50% at 2 microg/kg.

We enrolled one eye each of 174 glaucoma patients with inadequate intraocular pressure control who were on maximally tolerated medical therapy. We continued to administer maximum medical therapy for glaucoma. Study medications were either apraclonidine hydrochloride 0.5% or placebo (apraclonidine's vehicle). Patients were instructed to take the study medication every eight hours. We measured intraocular pressure, change in intraocular pressure from baseline, and the number of eyes requiring surgery after the addition of study medication.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-two (60%) of 86 patients treated with apraclonidine maintained adequate intraocular pressure control throughout the study and avoided surgery, compared with 28 (32%) of 88 patients treated with placebo (P < .001). Apraclonidine treatment resulted in significantly more patients attaining an additional 20% reduction or more in intraocular pressure from baseline and an intraocular pressure less than or equal to 20 mm Hg (P < .05). The most common ocular complication was conjunctival hyperemia (11 of 86 patients, 12.8%). The most frequent nonocular problem was dry mouth (four patients, 4.7%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nApraclonidine appeared to be safe in all eyes and efficacious in some eyes. It significantly lowered intraocular pressure when used in combination with maximally tolerated medical therapy, which delayed or prevented further glaucoma surgery for at least 90 days in 52 (60%) of 86 treated patients.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Limited information is available on treatment safety. This study intended to investigate the safety and tolerability of dexamphetamine in patients with acute cerebral ischemia. Methods\u2014 Forty-five patients with cerebral ischemia were enrolled within 72 hours after onset of symptoms. Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 dose levels (2.5, 5, or 10 mg orally twice daily) or placebo for 5 consecutive days. Adverse events, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, consciousness level, and functional outcome measures were followed up daily during treatment. Follow-ups were made at day 7 and 1 and 3 months after stroke. Results\u2014 Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate increased 14 mm Hg, 8 mm Hg, and 9 bpm, respectively, with dexamphetamine treatment compared with placebo (P \u22640.01). There was no difference between dexamphetamine and placebo regarding adverse events, body temperature, or consciousness level. During treatment, there was a benefit of dexamphetamine in neurological and functional outcome (P <0.05), but differences were not maintained at follow-up. Conclusions\u2014 Overall, dexamphetamine was safe and well tolerated by patients with acute cerebral ischemia, but blood pressure and heart rate increased during treatment in comparison to placebo. These observations may be important in the future planning of amphetamine trials because changes in these variables have been observed to interfere with clinical outcome. The suggestions of improvement in outcome must be confirmed in further studies.", "outbound_citations": ["11641592", "11546902", "10835440", "10830340", "10589798", "9804653", "9271150", "7491646", "8148107", "21551648", "21551653", "1675378", "21551642", "2339141", "3187463", "3275894", "3345072", "3187462", "3101073", "3901425", "7100929", "7134917", "14258950"], "inbound_citations": ["34666786", "34152062", "31327133", "30167675", "30034335", "29124985", "26787096"], "label": "0"}

The most effective strategy for treatment is combined behavioral intervention and pharmacologic therapy (1). Effective pharmacologic interventions for smoking cessation include several types of nicotine replacement and use of the non-nicotine medication bupropion (2, 3). Despite treatment advances, smoking relapse after successful intervention for smoking cessation occurs in 70% to 80% of patients within 6 to 12 months (4). Studies of relapse prevention strategies suggest that teaching coping skills may reduce the risk for relapse, but other behavioral therapies have shown little benefit (5, 6). Because pharmacologic therapy for smoking cessation has been proven effective and behavioral relapse prevention strategies alone have shown no great benefit, pharmacologic therapy for relapse prevention should be evaluated. Bupropion has been proven an effective intervention for smoking cessation, both as a single therapy and in combination with nicotine-patch therapy (2, 3). Because bupropion is effective for initiating abstinence from smoking and is safe for long-term therapy, we hypothesized that prolonged bupropion treatment in recently abstinent smokers would decrease the relapse rate. We compared sustained-release bupropion treatment with placebo for 1 year in participants who achieved initial abstinence after 7 weeks of therapy with open-label, sustained-release bupropion. Methods Participants This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of relapse prevention was performed at five sites (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; the Palo Alto Center for Pulmonary Disease Prevention, Palo Alto, California; Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island; Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon; and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts) and was approved by the institutional review board at each site. We recruited participants through advertisements and press releases. After passing an initial screening interview by telephone, participants attended an informational meeting. At this meeting, the study was explained and the participants completed questionnaires and gave written, informed consent. The volunteers were eligible for study inclusion if they were 18 years of age or older, had smoked an average of at least 15 cigarettes or more per day for the past year, were motivated to stop smoking, and were in generally good health. Only one smoker per household was allowed in the study. Exclusion criteria included a personal or family history of a seizure disorder; history of severe head trauma; predisposition to seizures (such as history of brain tumor or stroke); history or current diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia; presence of an unstable medical or psychiatric condition; pregnancy; lactation; dependence on alcohol or other nonnicotine substance in the past year; current use of psychotropic medications; previous use of bupropion; current use of tobacco products other than cigarettes; or current use of any therapy for smoking cessation [such as nicotine replacement therapy; fluoxetine, clonidine, buspirone, or doxepin therapy; or behavioral therapy]. Persons with current major depression were also excluded. Potential participants were deemed to have current major depression if: 1) they met the criteria for this condition on the basis of their responses in a structured clinical interview [conducted by a trained study assistant], or 2) they were judged to have major depression by the physician performing the entrance history and physical examination (7). Treatment Beginning at the baseline visit and continuing through study week 7, all participants received open-label, sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR), 300 mg/d (150 mg/d for 3 days, followed by 150 mg twice daily). At the baseline visit, participants were instructed to set a target quitting date after 1 week of medication use [usually day 8 of therapy]. Each participant attended weekly follow-up visits during the 7-week open-label phase. Participants were eligible for random assignment to receive bupropion or placebo in the double-blind phase if they 1) reported not smoking [not even a puff] during week 7 of the open-label phase and 2) had their self-report confirmed by an expired carbon monoxide level of 10 parts per million (ppm) or less. The randomly assigned participants returned for 14 visits during the double-blind phase (at weeks 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52) and 5 visits during the follow-up year (at weeks 53, 56, 64, 78, and 104). Participants also received a telephone follow-up at 21 months after study enrollment. At the baseline physical examination, each participant received a brief personalized message from the examining physician to stop smoking, set a target quitting date, and received self-help material that was based on a smoking cessation program designed by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (8). At each visit during the open-label and double-blind study phases, study assistants counseled participants for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Randomization to the placebo or bupropion groups was computer generated at a central location; the investigators did not know the patient assignments. All bupropion and placebo pills were identical in shape, size, and color. Assessments At baseline, participants had a physical examination; underwent chest radiography, laboratory testing, and electrocardiography; and completed a Fagerstrm Tolerance Questionnaire and a Beck Depression Inventory. The Fagerstrm Tolerance Questionnaire is a widely used measure of nicotine dependence with scores that range from 0 to 11; scores of 6 or greater indicate higher levels of dependence (9, 10). At each visit through week 53, study assistants recorded adverse experiences, as well as use of study and concomitant medications. Participants maintained a daily diary of withdrawal symptoms (11) and daily cigarette use that was reviewed at each visit through week 12. The Beck Depression Inventory (administered at baseline and weeks 7, 8, 12, 52, 53, 56, 78, and 104) is a 21-item, self-administered questionnaire that assesses severity of depressive symptoms (12). Smoking status was self-reported at each visit; reports of abstinence were considered validated with a measurement of carbon monoxide level in expired air of no higher than 10 ppm. Outcome Measures The main outcomes of interest were 1) weekly point-prevalence abstinence during medication treatment, 2) continuous abstinence during medication treatment, and 3) time to first relapse. Secondary outcomes included weight change over time and point prevalence and continuous-abstinence rates after completion of drug therapy. The weekly point-prevalence smoking status was defined as 1) self-report of not smoking during the previous 7 days that was confirmed by an expired air carbon monoxide level of 10 ppm or lower and 2) two or fewer consecutive missed visits. Smoking relapse was defined as a self report of smoking or an expired air carbon monoxide level greater than 10 ppm. Participants were also considered to have smoking relapse if they missed more than two consecutive visits. All participants meeting the abstinence criteria at every visit were considered continuously abstinent. Self-report determined the date of smoking relapse. For participants who self-reported not smoking but who were classified as smoking because of an elevated carbon monoxide level or because of consecutive missed visits, the date of relapse was defined as the day after the most recent previous study visit at which smoking abstinence was biochemically confirmed. Statistical Analysis We determined that we needed a sample size of 170 participants in each randomly assigned treatment group to detect a significant between-group difference in end-of-treatment abstinence rates of 0.15 at a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80. Assuming an abstinence rate of 35% for week 7 of the open-label phase, we determined that up to 1000 enrollees were needed to ensure a minimum sample of 340 nonsmoking participants (170 per group) for randomization. The 1-week point prevalence for smoking status during week 7 of the open-label bupropion phase was used to determine eligibility for random assignment to receive placebo or active sustained-release bupropion, 300 mg/d. To compare the baseline characteristics of the bupropion and placebo recipients, we used the two-sample t-test and the chi-square test for analysis of continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The efficacy of bupropion for preventing smoking relapse during the double-blind medication phase and follow-up phase was assessed by analyzing time to first smoking relapse. We used KaplanMeier survival estimates and a proportional hazards regression model (13, 14) to analyze time to first smoking relapse. For this analysis, time to first relapse was defined as the date of first relapse minus the date of randomization. For participants without relapse, time to first relapse was censored by using the date of their final (week 104) study visit. For the proportional hazards regression analysis, the response variable was time to first smoking relapse, and the independent variable was treatment. Randomization was stratified according to study site to ensure that similar numbers of participants were assigned to the treatment groups at each site. We verified that the treatment effect was not dependent on study site by performing an initial analysis that included the interaction of treatment by study site. Subsequently, we used a proportional hazards regression analysis with study site as a stratification factor to assess differences between treatment groups. Rates of point prevalence and continuous smoking abstinence were compared between treatment groups by using a logistic regression analysis with smoking status as the dependent variable and treat", "outbound_citations": ["10866874", "10450627", "10371223", "10053177", "9170768", "9337378", "7957014", "1341599", "1353803", "1744061", "2057036", "1956099", "3954551", "6379002", "735910"], "inbound_citations": ["36898367", "36618776", "36353488", "36293800", "34611902", "34668482", "33706003", "33464316", "32663106", "32578165", "32319681", "32008628", "31684681", "31666811", "31663029", "30758045", "30597657", "29069464", "30527452", "29773262", "29523670", "28691271", "28239942", "30184406", "27467642", "27179823", "26332005", "26692579", "27007975", "17874469", "27799513", "26196657", "26284723", "26422864", "25419583", "26025035", "25866497", "25705872", "25840382"], "label": "0"}

DATA SOURCES: Information was selected from a MEDLINE search (July 2000\u2013October 2001) of English-language medical literature using ziprasidone as the search term. Manual searches of pertinent journal article references, request for medical information from Pfizer, and access of the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration were also performed. STUDY SELECTION: All available published information regarding the pertinent characteristics of ziprasidone were considered for selection. DATA EXTRACTION: Pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies were selected to provide a comprehensive description of these characteristics. Clinical investigations were evaluated for design, sample size, diagnosis, duration, and outcome. Data from all investigations were selected by 1 author and reviewed by both authors. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ziprasidone is a benzisothiazolyl piperazine\u2014type atypical antipsychotic that shares the serotonin2A/dopamine2 (5-HT2A/D2) profile of the available atypical antipsychotics. Ziprasidone has demonstrated in vitro activity as a 5-HT1A receptor agonist and as a very weak inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. These data do not support ziprasidone as being a clinically meaningful inhibitor of serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake. Oral bioavailability of ziprasidone taken with food is approximately 60%, half-life is approximately 6\u20137 hours, and protein binding is extensive at >99%. Twelve metabolites have been identified, yet only 4 of these are considered to be primary metabolites. Metabolism of ziprasidone by aldehyde oxidase produces its only metabolite with potential pharmacologic activity; CYP3A4 also contributes to the metabolism of ziprasidone. Clinical studies support ziprasidone as efficacious for the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Daily doses permitted in these clinical trials ranged from 40 to 160 mg, but only doses between 120 and 160 mg/d have been superior to placebo. Future research efforts should be directed toward refractory schizophrenia, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, affective and anxiety symptoms associated with schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. Adverse effect characteristics of ziprasidone commonly include headache, nausea, and somnolence; infrequent effects include extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain. Ziprasidone has been reported to cause an average QTc prolongation of approximately 20 msec; there have only been 2 patients (0.06%) reported by the manufacturer to have a measured QTc interval >500 msec. CONCLUSIONS: Ziprasidone is a safe and efficacious atypical antipsychotic for the acute management of schizophrenia. Efficacy data and most safety data for ziprasidone support its use as a first-line treatment for schizophrenia; however, its potential effects on ventricular repolarization relegate it to second-line status in patients with comorbid cardiovascular risks.", "outbound_citations": ["11226809", "11199944", "10771458", "10771457", "11206599", "10784487", "10584766", "10553730", "10450273", "10462127", "10401912", "10192829", "10385213", "10193665", "9860108", "9690695", "9469675", "9193196", "9029052", "9236732", "8822531", "8568801", "8941167", "8822534", "8117328", "7683702", "1973941", "3841000"], "inbound_citations": ["33763203", "32703410", "32606594", "29915922", "28828223", "27534434"], "label": "0"}

Patients scheduled for vascular surgery received either dexmedetomidine (n = 22) or placebo (n = 19) IV beginning 20 min before the induction of anesthesia and continuing until 48 h after the end of surgery. All patients received standardized anesthesia. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were kept within predetermined limits by varying anesthetic level and using vasoactive medications. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and inhaled anesthetic concentration were monitored continuously; additional measurements included plasma and urine catecholamines. During emergence from anesthesia, heart rate was slower with dexmedetomidine (73 +/- 11 bpm) than placebo (83 +/- 20 bpm) (P = 0.006), and the percentage of time the heart rate was within the predetermined hemodynamic limits was more frequent with dexmedetomidine (P < 0.05).

The Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effect Scale (SAS) and the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) were administered before and 7 and 24 hours after medication was given. Compared with placebo, total motor activity was decreased by 41% with olanzapine (p = 0.004) and by 12% with haloperidol (NS). There were significantly more epochs with zero movement with olanzapine than with haloperidol or placebo. For non-zero epochs, the mean activity count and the distribution of activity counts did not differ significantly among groups. There were no positive findings on the SAS or the BAS. Olanzapine decreased total motor activity by increasing the amount of time during which subjects were immobile, rather than by affecting the magnitude of movement during periods in which there was activity.

The dose of PPA for weight loss is 75 mg/day. PPA has the same chemical similarity to pseudoephedrine that amphetamine has to methamphetamine. Because benzocaine causes weight loss by altering taste and PPA by central appetite suppression, they may induce additional weight loss when combined. These studies explore the safety and efficacy of low-dose PPA, pseudoephedrine, and PPA with benzocaine in causing weight loss.\n\n\nRESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES\nStudy 1 compared PPA 12.5 mg tid with 25 mg tid and placebo in a 6-week trial in 108 obese subjects. Study 2 compared pseudoephedrine 120 mg/day and a placebo in a 12-week trial with 72 obese subjects. Study 3 compared 4 groups of 20 obese subjects using PPA 75 mg/day, benzocaine gum 96 mg/day, PPA with benzocaine gum, and a placebo over 12 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth doses of PPA gave twice the weight loss of placebo, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Pseudoephedrine was no different than placebo in inducing weight loss. The PPA with benzocaine group had more adverse events than the benzocaine group (p = 0.03), the placebo group (p = 0.03), or the PPA group (p = 0.09) without additional weight loss.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nWe conclude that further studies with low-dose PPA for weight loss are indicated, that pseudoephedrine is not effective for weight loss, and that adding benzocaine to phenylpropanolamine increases adverse effects without increasing weight loss.", "outbound_citations": ["1356275", "1587079", "1445528", "1530830", "2680083", "2716162", "3516509", "7098772", "6761288", "778504", "808376"], "inbound_citations": ["36479472", "34159755", "33945051", "30014268"], "label": "0"}

This study used an isobolographic method to determine whether epidurally administered fentanyl and clonidine interact in an additive or synergistic manner. Ninety women with moderate to severe pain after elective cesarean section under epidural anesthesia were studied. Using a randomized, double-blind protocol, we assigned each patient to receive a single epidural injection of one of three doses of fentanyl, clonidine, or a fixed ratio combination. Pain relief, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and sedation were measured 15 min after injection. Each drug alone and in combination produced analgesia, as measured by pain relief scores, and reduced need for intravenous morphine. Although the effective dose producing analgesia in 50% of patients (ED50) for the mixture was only 52% of that predicted by an additive interaction, this did not differ significantly from additivity, likely due to large variability. Clonidine, alone or in combination with fentanyl, produced a minor reduction in BP, but did not affect HR or cause more sedation than fentanyl. Unlike studies in rodents, this clinical study did not demonstrate synergy between fentanyl and clonidine. This could reflect a true species difference or differences in methodologies used.

(N = 90) or haloperidol i.m. (N = 42) followed by oral treatment to day 7. After an initial ziprasidone i.m. dose of 10 mg, subsequent i.m. doses of 5 to 20 mg could be given every 4 to 6 hours (maximum daily dose = 80 mg) if needed, followed by oral ziprasidone, 80-200 mg/day.

Further reductions in these scores also occurred in both groups following transition to oral treatment. Ziprasidone was associated with a lower incidence of movement disorders and a reduced requirement for anticholinergic medication during both i.m. and oral treatment compared with haloperidol. Movement disorder scale scores improved with ziprasidone i.m. and oral treatment, but deteriorated with haloperidol.

Data were taken from subsets of patients with schizoaffective disorder, derived from two separate double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter studies. A total of 115 hospitalized patients with an acute episode of schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to receive either fixed oral doses of ziprasidone 40 mg/day (N = 16), 80 mg/day (N = 18), 120 mg/day (N = 22), 160 mg/day (N = 25), or placebo (N = 34) for 4 to 6 weeks. Mean baseline-to-endpoint changes in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, BPRS Core, Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale (CGI-S), BPRS Depressive, BPRS Manic, and Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale total scores were compared between the placebo and ziprasidone groups. Neurological (Simpson-Angus, Barnes Akathisia, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale [AIMS]) and other side effects were also assessed. Significant dose-related improvements on all primary efficacy variables (BPRS total, BPRS Core, CGI-S) and for BPRS Manic items were observed with ziprasidone treatment in a combined analysis of data from both studies (p \u2264 0.01). Ziprasidone 160 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in improving mean BPRS total, BPRS Core, BPRS Manic, and CGI-S scores (p < 0.05). At 120 mg/day, ziprasidone was significantly more effective than placebo in improving mean CGI-S scores (p < 0.05). The incidence of individual adverse events was generally low in all treatment groups and was not dose-related. In addition, no significant differences were observed between baseline-to-endpoint mean changes in Simpson-Angus and AIMS scores with placebo or ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day. These results suggest that ziprasidone may have efficacy in the treatment of affective as well as psychotic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder, with a low side-effect burden.", "outbound_citations": ["10192829", "10211146", "9860108", "8568801", "7562537", "7559373", "7520110", "8071290", "8328561", "1384075", "1938976", "2574607", "3387514", "3059473", "6608737", "6142525", "6813888", "6110654", "7192495", "6255132", "373665", "444788", "34327", "369472", "354733", "5042825", "4942959", "4936131", "4917967"], "inbound_citations": ["34270506", "28539955", "26779966"], "label": "0"}

Data were collected on intraoperative effects (onset/offset and quality of block and tourniquet pain), postoperative effects (pain intensity and analgesic consumption) and side effects recorded. Statistical significance as indicated in the original report and likely clinical relevance were taken into account to arrive at a judgment of overall benefit. Twenty-nine studies met all inclusion criteria. Data on 1,217 study subjects are included. Adjuncts used were opioids (fentanyl, meperidine, morphine, sufentanil), tramadol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; ketorolac, tenoxicam, acetyl-salicylate), clonidine, muscle relaxants (atracurium, pancuronium, mivacurium), alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate, potassium and temperature. There is good evidence to recommend NSAIDs in general and ketorolac in particular, for improving postoperative analgesia. Clonidine 1 microg/kg also appears to improve postoperative analgesia and prolong tourniquet tolerance. Opioids are poor by this route; only meperidine 30 mg or more has substantial postoperative benefit but at the expense of postdeflation nausea, vomiting and dizziness. Muscle relaxants improve intraoperative motor block and aid fracture reduction. Using NSAIDs or clonidine as adjuncts to IVRA improves postoperative analgesia and muscle relaxant improves motor block.", "outbound_citations": ["12670806", "12401636", "11133629", "10781465", "11009236", "10485774", "10357339", "10195533", "9539603", "9398953", "9322470", "9313271", "9211471", "9211473", "9141935", "9085956", "9068344", "9049557", "9259870", "8853097", "8836267", "8694157", "8956394", "7488478", "7484046", "7598236", "7760870", "7793648", "7976142", "8317644", "8418714", "8398960", "1530172", "1567041", "1599062", "1515390", "1911495", "2064886", "2024745", "2011742", "2174652", "2156466", "2176097", "2742169", "2765348", "3415022", "3408537", "3400845", "6477794"], "inbound_citations": ["35277340", "35340973", "33593724", "33533982", "33778124", "34824169", "31570204", "31172108", "29881525", "29387317", "28682950", "29430498", "29696122", "29115948", "29109641", "28384962", "28298758", "27891424", "27313608"], "label": "0"}

Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic agent exhibiting regional mesolimbic dopaminergic selectivity and a broad-based pharmacology encompassing serotonin, dopamine, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptor binding affinities. The authors' goal was to compare the incidence of tardive dyskinesia among patients receiving olanzapine and those receiving the conventional dopamine 2 antagonist haloperidol. Data were analyzed from three actively controlled and blind long-term responder studies of subjects meeting DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder treated with olanzapine (N = 707, up to 20 mg/day, 237 median days of exposure) or haloperidol (N = 197, up to 20 mg/day, 203 median days of exposure) who did not have evidence of tardive dyskinesia at baseline. All of the subjects had a chronic disease course (mean greater than 10 years), and there were no significant between-treatment group differences in demographic or disease characteristics. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale and research diagnostic criteria for tardive dyskinesia were used to define the comparative incidence rates of long-term treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia. The incidence of newly emergent tardive dyskinesia at any visit after baseline, at the final visit, and at the final two clinical assessments was statistically significantly lower among olanzapine-treated patients than among haloperidol-treated patients. These findings support an atypical extrapyramidal symptom profile and the potential of a significantly lower risk of tardive dyskinesia with olanzapine than with haloperidol among patients requiring maintenance antipsychotic treatment.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29409162"], "label": "0"}

These patients were selected from a pool of 1,996 patients who had a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder and who also met the following criteria: 1) the length of their current psychotic episode had to be 5 or fewer years, and 2) patients had to be 45 years of age or younger at onset of first psychotic symptoms. Compared to haloperidol, olanzapine showed a statistically significantly greater reduction in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total and negative scores and in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total and positive scores. Clinical response (defined as 40% or greater improvement in BPRS total score from baseline) was also statistically significantly higher in olanzapine-treated patients (67.2%) than in haloperidol-treated patients (29.2%). Olanzapine-treated patients further showed statistically significant improvements in the Simpson-Angus scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale scores, while haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on both measures. Compared to olanzapine-treated multiple-episode patients in the parent study, olanzapine-treated first-episode patients achieved an even statistically significantly higher response. Haloperidol-treated first-episode patients experienced statistically significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol-treated multiple-episode patients. In patients experiencing first-episode psychosis, olanzapine had a risk-benefit profile significantly superior to that of haloperidol.

We were interested in assessing whether similar improvements could be conferred upon elderly volunteers in order to gain a more complete understanding of the effects of age on monoaminergic manipulations of working memory and attention, as well as to explore the potential for pharmacological intervention in attention and executive dysfunction disorders in this age group. The main aim of the study was to characterise the dose-related effects of methylphenidate on a range of neuropsychological functions in elderly healthy volunteers. Sixty healthy elderly adult male volunteers received either a single oral dose of placebo, 20 mg or 40 mg methylphenidate prior to performing a variety of tasks designed to assess memory, attention and executive function. A randomised double-blind, between-subjects design was used. Methylphenidate had significant cardiovascular and subjective effects. However, unlike in younger volunteers, no significant effects of drug on working memory (spatial span and spatial working memory), response inhibition (stop-signal) or sustained attention (rapid visual information processing) were seen. Subtle effects on latency similar to those in younger volunteers were identified: both doses of methylphenidate resulted in a slowing in response time during set-shifting and decision-making. The results of this study demonstrate that, in elderly subjects, the cognitive effects of methylphenidate are grossly attenuated and distinct from the profile previously described in younger volunteers. It is suggested that methylphenidate may not be appropriate as a pharmacological intervention in elderly patient groups, such as those reporting age-related cognitive decline.", "outbound_citations": ["7862943", "7870923", "1672461", "1826059", "11581118", "11479391", "11481139", "11390298", "11160455", "11071707", "11291999", "10907387", "10654655", "11004884", "10550499", "10457535", "10525751", "10401468", "9766762", "9708845", "9542895", "9334425", "9336323", "9201809", "23965011", "9144102", "8988958", "8831298", "8786705", "7751922", "7731533", "7951684", "10690913", "7984295", "8221053", "1629849", "2267054", "2085779", "2303798", "2681316", "2795141", "2569169", "3382917", "2999977", "6111765", "1202204", "5490287", "11797064"], "inbound_citations": ["32794136", "32323954", "31660835", "30094335", "28124223", "27454675", "27421894", "27256296", "27646012"], "label": "0"}

Finally, are there advantages to combining behavioural and pharmacological interventions for children with ADHD? In the absence of secondary analyses, the MTA's primary intent-to-treat analyses released to date are difficult to interpret. While behavioural interventions represented a viable option for many families, the doses achieved via systematic titration and follow-up medication-management protocols yielded larger effect sizes on unblinded primary symptom reports than did behavioural treatments or the medication management used by most families in the community control conditions.

Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the 14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21), respectively. Percentage reduction in baseline HAM-A total score for each treatment week was calculated to determine whether the time to onset of anxiolytic activity differed among antidepressant responders to each agent. Central nervous system (CNS) adverse events were tabulated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBupropion SR and sertraline were comparably effective, both were superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms. and they did not differ in their effect on anxiety symptoms. Antidepressant responders (> 50% reduction in baseline HAM-D-21 score) in both groups showed marked and comparable reductions in HAM-A scores (baseline to exit). There were no differences between bupropion SR and sertraline in the median time (4 weeks) to reach a clinically significant anxiolytic effect (> or = 50% reduction in baseline HAM-A score).

The authors reviewed data contained within peer-reviewed published reports of clinical trials of lofexidine compared with detoxification using reducing doses of the opiate agonist methadone or the alpha-adrenergic agonist clonidine. Five published reports of clinical trials of lofexidine have been identified from peer-reviewed journals in the eight years between 1990 and 1998--all published within the last three years. Three of the reports compare lofexidine with clonidine, while the remaining two compare it with methadone detoxification. The three comparisons with clonidine find lofexidine to be similar in its moderating effect on the withdrawal syndrome, but without the same extent of problems with hypotension. Comparisons with methadone show a more rapid resolution of withdrawal symptoms with lofexidine--particularly with the accelerated 5-day lofexidine protocol. Such problems of hypotension as were encountered with lofexidine were adequately managed with dose reduction. Acceptability of the treatment to the patient (as measured by retention in treatment) appears to be greater with lofexidine than clonidine, although possibly less than with methadone. Lofexidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that is increasingly used in the management of opiate withdrawal--notably in the UK. The available data indicate that it is a useful new addition to the armamentarium of the clinician. Future studies should explore its application with improved protocols and in new treatment settings. This article reviews the recent advances in the study of lofexidine as a new treatment for opiate detoxification. It examines the background of the development and introduction of lofexidine into the U.K., with data on the extent to which it is now used in the U.K. in the treatment of opiate addiction. A review is then provided of the published evidence on the use of lofexidine in the management of opiate detoxification, mainly concentrating on the data from recent double-blind randomised trials. Finally, the possible future role of lofexidine in this field is considered.", "outbound_citations": ["9649976", "9649979", "9584973", "9031821", "8957147", "7612327", "7994508", "1860023", "2075851", "1968773", "2688778", "2413818", "4028630", "3904410", "6355070", "7338185", "7351747", "80526"], "inbound_citations": ["36630319", "33860319", "28823835"], "label": "0"}

This was performed to give a more objective idea of the relative analgesic potency of epidural clonidine.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty patients undergoing intestinal surgery during propofol anesthesia were studied. At induction, the patients received epidurally a dose of 10 micrograms/kg [corrected] clonidine in 7 ml saline followed by an infusion of 6 micrograms [corrected] x kg(-1) x h(-1) (7 ml/h) (group 1, n = 20), a dose of 7 ml bupivacaine, 0.5%, followed by 7 ml/h bupivacaine, 0.25% (group 2, n = 20), or a dose of 7 ml bupivacaine, 0.25%, followed by 7 ml/h bupivacaine, 0.125% (group 3, n = 20). Intraoperatively, increases in arterial blood pressure or heart rate not responding to propofol (0.5 mg/kg) were treated with intravenous alfentanil (0.05 mg/kg). Additional doses of propofol were given to maintain an adequate bispectral index. The epidural infusions were maintained for 12 h. In cases of subjective visual analogue pain scores up to 5 cm at rest or up to 8 cm during coughing, the patients were given access to a patient-controlled analgesia device.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring anesthesia, patients in group 1 required less propofol than those in groups 2 and 3 (78 [36-142] mg vs. 229 [184-252] mg and 362 [295-458] mg; P < 0.05) and less alfentanil than patients in group 3 (0 [0-0] mg vs. 11 [6-20] mg; P < 0.05). Analgesia lasted 380 min (range, 180-645 min) in group 1 versus 30 min (range, 25-40 min) in group 2 and 22 min (range, 12.5-42 min) in group 3 (P < 0.05). There was no suggestion of a hemodynamic difference among the three groups except for heart rates that were significantly reduced in patients in group 1. Sedation scores were significantly higher in this group during the first 2 h postoperatively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results show that high doses of epidural clonidine potentiate general anesthetics and provide more efficient postoperative analgesia than the two bupivacaine dosage regimens investigated.", "outbound_citations": ["8853097", "7486097", "8638296", "7676792", "7916547", "8363078", "8439023", "1519783", "1672060", "2223330", "2335273", "2817456", "2774269", "2999977", "6604383", "901353"], "inbound_citations": ["30386021", "27419911"], "label": "0"}

Treatment effects were assessed using direct observations of child behavior in a simulated (clinic-based) classroom and behavior rating scales completed by parents and physician. Videotapes of the simulated classroom were scored by coders who were blind to treatment status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no evidence (group data) that motor tics or vocal tics changed in frequency or severity during maintenance therapy compared with diagnostic or initial double-blind placebo evaluations. Behavioral improvements demonstrated during the acute drug trial were maintained during follow-up. There was no evidence (group data) of clinically significant adverse drug effects on cardiovascular function or growth at the end of 2 years of treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLong-term treatment with methylphenidate seems to be safe and effective for the management of ADHD behaviors in many (but not necessarily all) children with mild to moderate tic disorder.

We examined the effects of MP on attentional function in individuals with TBI referred specifically for attentional assessment and treatment. Subjects were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeated crossover design, using five different tasks designed to measure various facets of attentional function. MP produced a significant improvement in the speed of mental processing. Orienting to distractions, most aspects of sustained attention, and measures of motor speed were unaffected.

Following the development of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, the patients were randomly allocated to the GHB or to the flunitrazepam group. In addition to this, clonidine was administered in order to treat autonomic signs of withdrawal. In cases were hallucinations occurred, haloperidol was administered. There was no significant difference in the efficacy of treatment used in the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay between groups. The patients in the GHB-group required significantly higher dosages of haloperidol and significantly lower dosages of clonidine. 14 out of 21 patients from the GHB-group developed hypernatriaemia and 15 out of 21 developed a metabolic alkalosis. Symptoms of the autonomic nervous system were more effectively prevented by GHB as evident in the lower dosage requirement of clonidine. However, GHB may not sufficiently block the hyperactivity of the dopaminergic system or may have an hallucinogenic effect itself. This may be evident from the higher dosages of haloperidol which were necessary. Due to the latter fact, the administration of GHB cannot be recommended in all patients suffering from AWS in ICU settings.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32775345"], "label": "0"}

Risperidone appeared to have a faster onset of action. In both groups extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse events were few, and their severity was generally mild. Neither group showed evidence of a relation between drug plasma concentrations and clinical effectiveness.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRisperidone was well tolerated and as effective as medium doses of clozapine in patients with chronic schizophrenia who had been resistant to or intolerant of conventional neuroleptics.", "outbound_citations": ["8807035", "8690833", "8732318", "8942454", "7485642", "7755110", "7545060", "7542829", "7542050", "7840349", "7537287", "7977880", "7531355", "7961580", "7961557", "7961573", "7527327", "7514366", "8267129", "8120151", "7508675", "7690693", "7683702", "1468842", "1375019", "1670979", "3046553", "3363019", "3323261", "2887090", "393312"], "inbound_citations": ["36669344", "34496316", "34390232", "32487466", "31977065", "31851035", "31766049", "30864459", "30407873", "29915922", "28762843", "28655284", "28258419", "27977041", "27650195", "27648956", "27388573", "27372312", "26784704", "26756090", "26842482", "27216902"], "label": "0"}

Four dosing conditions (placebo, titration [gradual increase to target dose], b.i.d., and t.i.d.) were used. Dependent measures obtained on a weekly basis included: parent and teacher ratings of child behavior, parent-child conflicts, parent report of stimulant side effects, child self-report of mood symptoms, a sleep log, laboratory measures of attention, and actigraphic recording of sleep activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll dosing conditions resulted in significant effects on ADHD symptoms when compared with baseline. Relative to placebo, t.i.d. dosing was characterized by improvement on the greatest number of behavioral measures, and both b.i.d. and t.i.d. were generally more effective than titration. Direct comparisons of b.i.d. and t.i.d. dosing revealed that t.i.d. was associated with greater improvement on the Conners Parent Rating Scale Impulsivity/Hyperactivity factor, with a similar marginally significant effect for the ADD-H Teacher Rating Scale Hyperactivity factor. The analysis of clinically significant change favored a three-times-a-day dosing schedule over placebo on both parent and teacher ratings of impulsivity/hyperactivity and attention. Compared with placebo, appetite suppression was rated, on average, as more severe in the t.i.d. and titration conditions, but not in the b.i.d. condition. However, the number of subjects who exhibited any or severe appetite suppression did not differ significantly between the b.i.d. and t.i.d. schedules. Although there was no difference in sleep duration for children on b.i.d. and t.i.d. schedules, total sleep time appeared to decrease slightly on t.i.d. relative to placebo according to both parent ratings and actigraphic assessment. There were no significant differences between b.i.d. and t.i.d. on any other side effects or sleep variables.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor many children with ADHD, t.i.d. dosing may be optimal. There are few differences in acute side effects between b.i.d. and t.i.d. MPH dosing.

A movement disorder typically is defined as dysfunction in the implementation of appropriate targeting and velocity of intended movements, dysfunction of posture, the presence of abnormal involuntary movements, or the performance of normal-appearing movements at inappropriate or unintended times. The movement abnormalities are not due to weakness or abnormal muscle tone, but may be accompanied by weakness or abnormal tone\n\nBy convention, movement disorders are divided into two major categories. The first is hyperkinetic movement disorders, sometimes referred to as dyskinesias. This term refers to abnormal, repetitive involuntary movements and encompasses most of the childhood movement disorders, including tics, chorea/ballismus, dystonia, myoclonus, stereotypies, and tremor. The second category is hypokinetic movement disorders, sometimes referred to as akinetic/rigid disorders. The primary movement disorder in this category is parkinsonism, manifested primarily in adulthood as Parkinson disease or one of many forms of secondary parkinsonism. Hypokinetic disorders are relatively uncommon in children. Although ataxia, weakness, and spasticity are characterized by motor dysfunction, by common convention these entities are not included among \u201cmovement disorders.\u201d This review focuses on dyskinesias because they represent the bulk of movement disorders in children\n\nThe components of the \u2026", "outbound_citations": ["11865128", "12462329", "11026181", "10686169", "7567345"], "inbound_citations": ["36891113", "36222774", "36118511", "35072530", "35040697", "34469400", "35274462", "33410106", "33150968", "32587895", "32606521", "32244155", "31126998", "30414398", "29405267", "29177618", "28972055", "28335910", "31435502", "28745663", "27158458", "27061943", "30713926"], "label": "0"}

We proposed that concomitant treatment with an appetite suppressant such as phenylpropanolamine (PPA) would lead to a decrease in appetite and therefore loss of weight.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PPA, 75 mg/day, in outpatients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia (DSM-IV) who were stable on clozapine treatment for at least 4 months and had gained > 10% of their baseline body weight since starting clozapine. Patients were evaluated for adverse effects and weighed weekly. A Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) assessment, a short dietary quiz, and blood indices were completed monthly.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixteen patients were equally randomly assigned to receive PPA or placebo. The groups did not differ in mean age, baseline weight, dose of clozapine, baseline PANSS scores, or the percent of weight gained since the start of clozapine. There was no significant effect of treatment on weight (t = 0.219, df = 10, p = .831). There was no significant change in either the total PANSS scores (t = -0.755, df = 10, p = .468), the positive or negative symptom cluster scores, or any of the remaining variables.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPhenylpropanolamine 75 mg/day was well tolerated but was not effective in reversing established weight gain associated with clozapine treatment in stable outpatients with schizophrenia.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36190739", "32871013", "30529195", "28056018", "27496573", "26221050"], "label": "0"}

The participants in this study were part of a longitudinal study of the life histories of 492 children, one third of whom were identified as hyperactive in 1974 and whose childhood symptom ratings and medical histories were used to establish Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., revised; DSM-III-R) ADHD diagnoses (American Psychiatric Association, 1987). The objectives of the study centered on describing (a) developmental history of tobacco use among ADHD and non-ADHD participants in a longitudinal sample, (b) the characteristic adult patterns of tobacco use from early adolescence through early adulthood, and (c) the relationship between ADHD status and tobacco and substance dependence outcomes. Adult data were obtained for 81% of the original 492 participants (77% of the ADHD and 86% of the controls). Lifetime and current tobacco use were assessed from child, adolescent, and adult data, yielding eight measures of smoking status. The study showed that participants with and without ADHD did not differ in age of initiation to smoking, but there was a significant difference in the age they began smoking regularly. By age 17, 46% of all participants with ADHD, as contrasted with 24% of the age-mate controls, reported smoking cigarettes daily. In adulthood, the proportion of participants with ADHD who were current smokers (42%) continued to exceed that of the age-mate controls (26%). Among current adult smokers, 35% with ADHD smoked daily as compared to 16% of the age-mate controls. There were significantly different lifetime tobacco dependence rates\u201440% compared to 19% for age-mate controls.

The dose required to produce this effect can be associated with maternal respiratory depression, hypotension, nausea, or pruritus. Because clonidine potentiates the analgesic effects of opioids without increasing their side effects, the authors wanted to determine the efficacy of low doses of intrathecal clonidine (15 and 30 micro gram) combined with sufentanil. Methods Ninety\u2010eight parturient requesting labor analgesia were studied. In a combined spinal\u2010epidural technique, patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following intrathecal solutions: either 15 micro gram clonidine (n = 10); 30 micro gram clonidine (n = 10); 2.5 micro gram sufentanil (n = 13); 5 micro gram sufentanil (n = 13); 2.5 micro gram sufentanil and 15 micro gram clonidine (n = 13); 2.5 micro gram sufentanil and 30 micro gram clonidine (n = 13); 5 micro gram sufentanil and 15 micro gram clonidine (n = 13); or 5 micro gram sufentanil and 30 micro gram clonidine (n = 13). Visual analog scores for pain, blood pressure, heart rate, sensory levels, incidence of nausea and pruritus, and motor blockade, and maternal and cord blood concentrations of clonidine were recorded. Results Patients receiving 30 micro gram intrathecal clonidine with 2.5 or 5 micro gram intrathecal sufentanil had significantly longer\u2010lasting analgesia (145 +/\u2010 36 and 145 +/\u2010 43 min vs. 104 +/\u2010 35 for those receiving 5 micro gram intrathecal sufentanil alone). Clonidine levels were undetectable in maternal serum. Conclusions Thirty micrograms of intrathecal clonidine combined with 2.5 or 5 micro gram intrathecal sufentanil significantly increased the duration of analgesia during the first stage of labor without adverse maternal or fetal effects.", "outbound_citations": ["9174303", "9089856", "8853097", "7486165", "7618720", "7676792", "8092504", "7916547", "8010467", "8250306", "8250307", "8489059", "2087327", "2824108", "3785964", "2937353", "7358813"], "inbound_citations": ["35659958", "32333825"], "label": "0"}

In addition, patients reacted faster on correct responses not preceded by an error than on errors (especially false alarms) or on correct responses following an error. The slowness during error reactions may reflect decreased confidence or confusion during stimulus classification. This uncertainty may also lead subjects to respond with greater caution, hence more slowly, on correct responses following errors. Notably, methylphenidate increased the slowing of reactions on error trials as well as on correct reactions following an error.

The Assessment of Cardioversion Using Transesophageal Echocardiography (ACUTE) Multicenter Study is a randomized clinical trial of patients undergoing electrical cardioversion of AF of >2 days' duration comparing a transesophageal-guided strategy (TEE) with brief anticoagulation to the conventional anticoagulation strategy. Patients randomly assigned to the TEE-guided strategy receive therapeutic anticoagulation before TEE and cardioversion, followed by 4 weeks of anticoagulation. Patients with thrombus imaged by TEE have postponement of cardioversion, continue anticoagulation for 3 weeks, and undergo a repeat TEE. Conventional strategy patients receive 3 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion, followed by 4 weeks of anticoagulation after cardioversion. The primary end point events are ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, and systemic embolization for an 8-week period from enrollment. Secondary end points are major and minor bleeding, all-cause mortality, successful return to and maintenance of sinus rhythm, and cost effectiveness. Analysis is based on the intention-to-treat principle. The anticipated rates of embolism of 2.9% for conventional strategy and 1.2% for the TEE-guided strategy are based on published research and the completed pilot study. The ACUTE Multicenter Study will randomize therapy and follow an estimated 3,000 patients from 65 study sites to determine the relative efficacy of the TEE-guided and conventional approaches to electrical cardioversion for patients in AF.

In a randomized double-blind design they were additionally infused with 150 micrograms clonidine or placebo from 1040 to 1110 hours. After CCK-4 all patients experienced symptom attacks. No effects of clonidine on panic psychopathology or blood gas parameters were observed. After CCK-4, in the clonidine condition the pituitary release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and prolactin was seemingly enhanced compared to placebo. Our results suggest that CCK-4-induced panic attacks are not suppressible by presynaptic alpha-2 receptor stimulation. Moreover, they point to a synergistic postsynaptic action of clonidine to CCK-4 upon pituitary hormone secretion.

Observed side effects include hypotension, bradycardia, sedation, and dryness of the mouth. A recent clinical study demonstrated that 150\u00b5g intrathecal clonidine administered postoperatively as the sole analgesic agent was effective but produced hypotension and sedation. Animal studies have provided evidence of a biphasic effect on blood pressure after intrathecal clonidine administration, but no data concerning this effect in humans currently exist. This study was performed to evaluate the dose-response hemodynamic and analgesic profiles of intrathecal clonidine administered after a standard surgical intervention, without perioperative administration of additional analgesics, local anesthetics, or tranquilizers. Methods:In a randomized prospective double-blind study, 30 women who underwent elective cesarean section during general anesthesia with thiopental, nitrous oxide, and halothane were studied. Forty-five minutes after tracheal extubation, a lumbar intrathecal puncture was performed, and the patients received 150 (group 1), 300 (group 2), or 450 (group 3) \u00b5g clonidine. Postoperative analgesia was assessed on a visual analog scale at rest and after deep cough at standard time points up to 24 h. At the same time points, blood pressure, heart rate, sedation, and respiratory rate also were recorded. Results:Intrathecal clonidine decreased pain in all three groups both at rest and with coughing very shortly after injection, in a dose-dependent fashion. Clonidine 450 and 300 \u00b5g reduced pain scores significantly earlier (3rd and 6th min after intrathecal injection respectively),compared with 150 \u00b5g clonidine. Pain relief, defined as the time to first request for supplemental analgesic by patients, lasted 402 \u00b1 75 min in group 1, 570 \u00b1 76 min in group 2, and 864 \u00b1 80 min in group 3; significant differences among all groups; P<0.01-0.001). Clonidine reduced mean arterial pressure compared with baseline only in group 1 (21 \u00b1 13%, P<0.05). Delayed hypotension or bradycardia were not encountered after any of the three dose studies. Sedation was evident in all groups, but group 3 patients were significantly more sedated than group 1 and 2 patients. Respiratory rate and motor activity of the lower extremities were unaffected in all three groups (differences not significant). Conclusions:These results demonstrate dose-dependent analgesia after intrathecal clonidine at doses as great as 450 \u00b5g. The nearly immediate analgesic effect observed after intrathecal injection of 300 and 450 \u00b5g clonidine strongly argues for a spinal rather than a systemic site of action of this \u03b12-adrenergic agonist. After 300 and 450 \u00b5g intrathecal clonidine a relative hemodynamic stability is observed, suggesting a pressor effect at peripheral sites.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37113260", "36431344", "36111378", "35782225", "35310422", "34717535", "33814584", "32260535", "32179953", "31435916", "30945105", "31198254", "30245586", "28627793", "29628568", "28823524", "28868303", "28781445", "28042914", "26893118", "27212750", "27190921", "26702205", "26130975", "25829901"], "label": "0"}

The goal of this study was to estimate the total expected costs for the treatment and management of school-age children with ADHD using 6 commonly prescribed pharmacotherapies: methylphenidate immediate-release/extended-release (MPH IR/ER), methylphenidate immediate-release (MPH IR), Metadate CD (branded MPH IR/ER), Concerta (branded MPH ER), Ritalin (branded MPH IR), and Adderall (a combination of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine salts). A literature review and clinical assessment using a 27-question survey instrument were used to capture information on the clinical characteristics of ADHD, including common treatment regimens, clinical management of patients, pathways of care, and components of care. A meta-analysis provided response rates for 3 commonly used pharmacotherapies: Metadate CD, MPH IR, and Adderall. Information from the clinical assessment and the meta-analysis were used to populate a decision-analytic model to compute total expected cost for each comparator. The average total annual expected cost per patient was $1,487 for Metadate CD, $1,631 for Concerta. $1,792 for MPH IR/ER, $1,845 for MPH IR, $2,080 for Ritalin, and $2,232 for Adderall.

Patients were randomly allocated to receive either placebo, 0.1 mg morphine or 0.1 mg morphine+50 microg clonidine in addition to 15 mg bupivacaine intrathecally. The primary outcome parameter was the time to first opioid request. Statistical differences were calculated with U-test or Fisher's exact test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClonidine did not result in a significant improvement of postoperative analgesia. The mean time until first opioid request was for placebo 10.3+/-7.9 h, for 0.1 mg morphine 23.0+/-3.9 h and for 0.1 mg morphine+ 50 microg clonidine 21+/-6.9 h, respectively. Clonidine significantly increased the rate of adverse effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur trial did not confirm an improved analgesia with the combination of intrathecal morphine and clonidine.

Eight subjects (six modafinil; two placebo) were randomized to each of the four dose groups. Modafinil or a placebo was administered once daily for 7 days.

In 39 patients participating in a double-blind clozapine study, the [3H]QNB assay was used to measure serum antimuscarinic activity: (1) on baseline medications; (2) after a 4-week haloperidol trial; (3) after a 16-week clozapine trial of either 100, 300, or 600 mg/d; and (4) after 1 or 2 consecutive 16-week clozapine trials with remaining doses in nonresponders.

Clozapine levels were good predictors of serum antimuscarinic activity only in patients taking 300 or 600 mg/d.

Fifteen of them were given olanzapine in a fixed dose of 10 mg/day PO and 14 of them were given haloperidol in a fixed dose of 10 mg/day PO for 6 weeks after a 2-week drug washout period. Fifteen age-matched healthy control subjects were used as control group. PRL levels were measured both before and after the 6-week treatment period in the patients. At the end of the 6th week, the PRL values observed with olanzapine treatment were significantly less than those observed with haloperidol, but not different from those of the controls. There was a significant positive correlation between the PRL values and the severity of extrapyramidal side effects in only the haloperidol group after the six week's treatment period. Our data indicate that short-term olanzapine treatment at doses of 10 mg/day PO causes minimal elevations in PRL secretion in male schizophrenic patients in contrast to haloperidol. This finding is consistent with the previous reports and may be attributed to olanzapine's differential effects on dopamine neurotransmission.", "outbound_citations": ["10511917", "9989565"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

The authors' goal was to assess the effects of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol on glucose and cholesterol levels in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder during a randomized double-blind 14-week trial.\n\n\nMETHOD\nOne hundred fifty-seven patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were inpatients at four hospitals were originally included in the study. The 14-week trial consisted of an 8-week fixed-dose period and a 6-week variable-dose period. Planned assessments included fasting glucose and cholesterol, which were collected at baseline and at the end of the 8-week period and the following 6-week period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred eight of the 157 patients provided blood samples at baseline and at least at one point after random assignment to clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol during the treatment trial. Seven of these patients had diabetes; their glucose levels were >125 mg/dl at baseline. Data from 101 patients were used for statistical analyses. During the initial 8-week period there was an overall significant increase in mean glucose levels. There were significant increases in glucose levels at the end of the 8-week fixed-dose period for patients given clozapine (N=27) and those given haloperidol (N=25). The olanzapine group showed a significant increase of glucose levels at the end of the 6-week variable-dose period (N=22). Fourteen of the 101 patients developed abnormal glucose levels (>125 mg/dl) during the trial (six with clozapine, four with olanzapine, three with risperidone, and one with haloperidol). Cholesterol levels were increased at the end of the 8-week fixed-dose period for the patients given clozapine (N=27) and those given olanzapine (N=26); cholesterol levels were also increased at the end of the 6-week variable-dose period for patients given olanzapine (N=22).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this prospective randomized trial, clozapine, olanzapine, and haloperidol were associated with an increase of plasma glucose level, and clozapine and olanzapine were associated with an increase in cholesterol levels. The mean changes in glucose and cholesterol levels remained within clinically normal ranges, but approximately 14% of the patients developed abnormally high glucose levels during the course of their participation in the study.", "outbound_citations": ["12654411", "12502614", "12006893", "11926934", "11823268", "11735847", "11778142", "11247108", "11603883", "11078035", "11056833", "10906363", "10928397", "10831479", "11087022", "10584769", "10584766", "10484969", "10479950", "10485643", "10399896", "10360147", "10372259", "10554900", "10211179", "10197898", "10333925", "10079027", "9921705", "9798083", "9926128", "9669191", "9328511", "9108812", "8870896", "8739670", "8615434", "8770530", "8736275", "8092346", "8067501", "1905770", "3363019", "3598450", "1245144", "5717295", "5634402", "5582955"], "inbound_citations": ["36005598", "35800481", "34521282", "33895793", "33774704", "32151695", "31860457", "31887669", "31801314", "31798479", "30718115", "30675684", "31493223", "30050695", "29664448", "29097257", "29736057", "29210808", "29128242", "28818421", "29162032", "28859580", "28636569", "27129913", "28274344", "28316973", "27729563", "27414240", "28391878", "27889922", "27796257", "27234980", "27403239", "29955467", "27043122", "27216904", "27067724", "26802597", "29955467"], "label": "0"}

Results: The MTA study is a complex, standardized, carefully implemented, randomized control trial. Review of the MTA study indicated that future studies should be aligned clearly with either effectiveness or efficacy objectives but not both. Questions selected for study should be simple, clear, and important. Measurement, sampling, and data collection must adhere to the principle of simplicity to ensure maximum participation. All methodological decisions should be geared to attaining the research objectives: in effectiveness trials, this means evaluating treatments that have a high potential for dissemination if proven successful and recruiting only new referrals from child mental health settings. Conclusions: The MTA study has raised the standard for technical excellence in child treatment research and will draw attention to some fundamental issues in large-scale child treatment studies, including articulating objectives and questions, setting priorities for measurement and sampling, and identifying treatments for evaluation that have a high probability of dissemination if found effective.", "outbound_citations": ["10576535", "10576536", "9566542", "9448521", "9294378", "9183129", "8885584", "8773637", "7911916", "7665456", "7853045", "7593864", "8192313", "19565683", "6528136", "447779"], "inbound_citations": ["30724327", "30496240", "28700715", "26671892"], "label": "0"}

In one of the studies, patients noted from the side-effects whether they were taking methylphenidate or placebo, and it is, in fact, unlikely that any of the studies were blind. The diagnostic criteria used in two of the studies were not appropriate according to present knowledge, leaving three samples of subjects meeting the present criteria for AD/HD. In one study, the patient material was extremely selective: 74% of subjects belonged to social class 1 and 2, and only 35% of those who came for treatment were eligible. Only one study has an acceptable (though not perfect) design. In this study of patients in a psychiatric clinic, no difference was found between methylphenidate and placebo. In two studies, subjects who improved on methylphenidate were followed up. Of the total of 24 subjects in these two samples, only four continued with methylphenidate after 3-12 months; two of them suffered from narcolepsy and one was a substance abuser.

The purpose of the current study was to estimate the relative potency of clonidine by epidural and intrathecal routes in the treatment of capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia as a model of central hypersensitivity and of noxious heat as a model of acute pain. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either intrathecal clonidine (75, 150, or 300 micrograms) or epidural clonidine (150, 300, or 600 micrograms) and rated pain from a Peltier-controlled thermode at a lumbar, thoracic, and cervical dermatomal site before and after drug administration. In addition, they rated pain from intradermal capsaicin injections at a lumbar dermatome before and 60 min after clonidine injection and described areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia to mechanical stimuli. Clonidine's effect differed with route of administration and modality of sensory testing. For acute thermal pain, intrathecal clonidine produced a dose-dependent analgesia with a lumbar>thoracic>cervical gradient, whereas only one dose of epidural clonidine reduced thermal pain and this was at the thoracic testing site. In contrast, the potency of clonidine to reduce capsaicin-induced allodynia was similar between the two routes of injection, and for hyperalgesia, clonidine was only slightly more potent after intrathecal than epidural injection. These data support clinical studies from non-comparative trials and suggest there is a >6-fold potency ratio of intrathecal:epidural administration of clonidine for acute pain, but a <2-fold potency ratio for these routes for mechanical hypersensitivity.", "outbound_citations": ["9728835", "9197294", "9197296", "8929439", "8853097", "8712447", "8628581", "7573998", "7854795", "8092504", "8097888", "1736694", "2817456", "2780068", "2878134", "6875640"], "inbound_citations": ["33759294", "33453211", "32888082", "31608551", "30579387", "29692626", "28627793", "35005384", "27203797", "26893118", "25599305", "25899631", "24649361", "25012511", "23533254", "23082949", "22631599", "21496614", "20395821", "18713912", "17822849", "18299097", "17259863", "16806709", "16439173", "16300874", "16037177", "15748875", "15505442", "15329600", "15281519", "14499421", "19475309", "12850649", "12826860", "12826855", "12766658", "12717147", "12606922", "12657498", "12516897", "12646983", "12401632", "19475234", "12034378", "11752998", "11762269", "11465609", "11465608", "11082457", "11098104", "11098104"], "label": "0"}

After open-label treatment with olanzapine for 9 weeks, both groups were clinically stable, suggesting that the discontinuation symptoms were transient. However, subjects who had been randomly assigned to the 3- to 5-day placebo discontinuation segment achieved somewhat less global clinical improvement.

This study examined the suitability of the above data and methods for comparing AERs of nine newer antidepressants: bupropion, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, moclobemide, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. First, the authors examined data precision and comparability across drugs by analyzing placebo-arm AERs and their 95% confidence limits for each drug and by testing the homogeneity of placebo-arm AERs across drugs. The rationale was that placebo AER heterogeneity is likely a reflection of heterogeneity of nonpharmacologic factors among CTs. For all 16 adverse events examined, placebo AERs were found to be significantly heterogenous, suggesting significant nonpharmacologic heterogeneity across drugs. Second, using placebo AER heterogeneity as a measure of nonpharmacologic heterogeneity, the authors estimated the degree to which active drug and placebo-subtracted AERs were related to nonpharmacologic heterogeneity by estimating the degree of association between active drug and placebo AERs and between placebo-subtracted and placebo AERs. Also, 95% confidence limits for placebo-subtracted AERs were calculated. It was found that most active drug AERs and some placebo-subtracted AERs were significantly correlated with placebo AERs, suggesting a relationship with nonpharmacologic heterogeneity. Placebo-subtracted AERs were less strongly related than were active drug AERs. Finally, the authors discuss factors that may be associated with the observed heterogeneity and offer suggestions that may improve the methodology and reporting of CTs.", "outbound_citations": ["9310564", "9297993", "9310565", "8606568", "8860062", "29569415", "7627070", "7696728", "1474186", "1552037", "1727960", "1672966", "3760920", "3774930", "3726073", "1150904", "4853118", "5272671", "5670907", "5334522"], "inbound_citations": ["29935419"], "label": "0"}

We tested the hypothesis that mice from the four replicate hyperactive lines would respond differently to methylphenidate (Ritalin), apomorphine (non-selective dopamine agonist), SCH 23390 (selective D1-like dopamine antagonist), and raclopride (selective D2-like dopamine antagonist) than individuals from the four replicate, randomly bred, control lines. After animals were habituated (3 weeks) to their cages with attached wheels, drugs were administered via intraperitoneal injections, at night, during peak wheel-running activity. Revolutions on wheels 10-70 min post-injection were used to quantify drug responses. Ritalin (15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) increased wheel running in control lines but decreased running in selected lines. A low-dose (0.125 mg/kg) of apomorphine reduced wheel running by a similar amount in control and selected lines; however, higher doses of apomorphine (0.25 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg) produced greater reductions in wheel running in the control lines. SCH 23390 (0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg) caused greater reductions in wheel running in control than in selected lines. Raclopride (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg) reduced wheel running by a similar amount in control and selected lines. These results support the interpretation that genetically determined hyperactive wheel-running behavior is associated with altered dopaminergic function in this mouse model. More specifically, results suggest that D1-like (D1 or D5), but not D2-like (D2, D3, or D4), dopamine receptors have reduced function in the high-running mice. The fact that Ritalin decreased wheel running in selected lines further supports their use as an animal model of ADHD.", "outbound_citations": ["8878347", "12122043", "12122080", "12144025", "12223567", "11815655", "11702085", "11531733", "11210448", "11572966", "11862361", "11027236", "10898892", "10793317", "10654668", "10654672", "10654658", "10654657", "10654656", "9888856", "9858756", "9862401", "9708845", "9708834", "9708847", "9710457", "9708840", "9670598", "9443537", "9145553", "9118342", "8699874", "7566118", "7614004", "7717410", "8090798", "8401595", "8097720", "8380525", "1360797", "1534574", "1347172", "2803180", "2462397", "2895008", "2960914", "4070332", "6847335", "43484", "566540", "658143", "341313", "4819"], "inbound_citations": ["37273279", "35504410", "35326289", "33394335", "32978270", "32909333", "32725625", "32338538", "31521739", "31849625", "31548286", "31191344", "31413714", "30261552", "29992990", "29931508", "29126998", "29372315", "28704221", "28602748", "28794174", "28588553", "27749013", "27743985", "27449202", "27233827", "27106566", "27312181", "27150120", "27147989", "29491918", "26196864", "26044640", "26052795", "25435316"], "label": "0"}

Methods: This was an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome measure was the Total Tic score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). Results: Thirty-four medication-free subjects (26 children and 8 adults) ranging in age from 6 to 62 years (mean = 19.7 \u00b1 17.0 years) participated. YGTSS Total Tic scores were similar at baseline (26.0 \u00b1 5.1 for risperidone vs 27.4 \u00b1 8.5 for placebo). After 8 weeks of treatment (mean daily dose of 2.5 \u00b1 0.85), the 16 subjects on risperidone showed a 32% reduction in tic severity from baseline, compared to a 7% reduction for placebo patients (n = 18) (F[2,64] = 6.07; p = 0.004). The 12 children randomized to risperidone showed a 36% reduction in tic symptoms compared to an 11% decrease in the 14 children on placebo (F[2,48] = 6.38; p = 0.004). Two children on risperidone showed acute social phobia, which resolved with dose reduction in one subject but resulted in medication discontinuation in the other. A mean increase in body weight of 2.8 kg was observed in the risperidone group compared to no change in placebo (F[2,64] = 10.68; p = 0.0001).

The authors used a new experimental pain model in human skin to determine the time course of analgesic and hyperalgesic effects of the &mgr;-receptor agonist remifentanil alone or in combination with the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor antagonist S-ketamine or the &agr;2-receptor agonist clonidine. Methods Thirteen volunteers were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation at a high current density (2 Hz, 67.3 \u00b1 16.8 mA, mean \u00b1 SD) induced acute pain (numerical 11-point rating scale: 5\u20136 out of 10) and stable areas of mechanical hyperalgesia to punctate stimuli and touch (allodynia). The magnitude of pain and area of hyperalgesia were assessed before, during, and after drug infusion (remifentanil at 0.1 &mgr;g \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121 and S-ketamine at 5 &mgr;g \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121 over a period of 30 min, respectively; clonidine infusion at 2 &mgr;g/kg for 5 min). Results Remifentanil reduced pain and areas of punctate hyperalgesia during infusion. In contrast, postinfusion pain and hyperalgesia were significantly higher than control. During infusion of S-ketamine, pain and hyperalgesia decreased and gradually normalized after infusion. When given in combination, S-ketamine abolished postinfusion increase of punctate hyperalgesia but did not reduce increased pain ratings. Clonidine alone did not significantly attenuate pain or areas of hyperalgesia. However, when given in combination with remifentanil, clonidine attenuated postinfusion increase of pain ratings. Conclusions Opioid-induced postinfusion hyperalgesia could be abolished by S-ketamine, suggesting an N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor mechanism. In contrast, elevated pain ratings after infusion were not reduced by ketamine but were alleviated by the &agr;2-receptor agonist clonidine. The results of this study suggest different mechanisms of opioid-induced postinfusion antianalgesia and secondary hyperalgesia.", "outbound_citations": ["12223586", "12209704", "12151554", "12088951", "12062477", "11973202", "11916808", "11818772", "11834301", "11801363", "11888226", "11808827", "12127091", "11895270", "11719729", "11506112", "11498314", "11429351", "11408554", "11323121", "11207668", "11226107", "11159234", "11286609", "11165371", "11135717", "11102461", "10969310", "10910490", "10839912", "10691234", "10601673", "10564731", "10527659", "10490157", "10655908", "10467917", "10027848", "10389785", "10439763", "9728835", "9272793", "9197294", "9009955", "8819527", "8638836", "8628581", "7573998", "7577256", "8278457", "8363078", "1643675", "1593488", "1928767", "2335273", "2817456", "3567599", "687501"], "inbound_citations": ["37245840", "37181565", "36330161", "35968556", "35914624", "35277087", "35239547", "35521018", "34699405", "34501814", "33779215", "33318153", "32974993", "32516227", "32326188", "32006699", "31541650", "31400808", "31870829", "31286397", "31785719", "30983591", "31198252", "30759061", "30705603", "31125279", "30153752", "29635764", "29634425", "29670398", "29440535", "28853040", "29121294", "28319527", "27694319", "28693439", "28383472", "28365208", "28638273", "28150135", "28158165", "27762659", "27029459", "27598412", "26906668", "26179561", "27533634", "27388980", "27320469", "26994226", "26934941", "26949390", "26655493", "26771515", "26295750", "26461074", "26142224", "25824051", "25910532", "28352709", "25542291", "25830866", "26131165", "25815431", "25750586", "25932115"], "label": "0"}

This retrospective study examined the relative efficacy of these drugs in chronically institutionalized patients refractory to conventional antipsychotic agents.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA total of 24 patients who at different time periods had received adequate trials of both clozapine and risperidone and met our inclusion criteria for minimum dose and duration of each trial were included; for clozapine, a minimum dose of 300 mg/day had to be maintained for at least 12 weeks, and for risperidone, a minimum dose of 6 mg/day for at least 6 weeks. Information obtained from systematic retrospective chart review was blindly rated by 2 psychiatrists using the 7-point Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale on overall clinical state and along specific symptom domains of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and aggressive behavior.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean +/- SD dose was 520+/-94 mg/day for clozapine and 7.5+/-2.2 mg/day for risperidone. Fourteen patients (58%) were classified as responders to clozapine, while 6 (25%) responded to risperidone (CGI-I score of 1 or 2); on specific symptom domains, response rates to clozapine were 38% (9/24) on positive symptoms, 29% (7/24) on negative symptoms, and 71% (12/17) on aggressive behavior. For risperidone, response rates were 17% (4/24) on positive symptoms, 8% (2/24) on negative symptoms, and 41% (7/17) on aggressive behavior.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of this study support the utility of first giving a risperidone trial in a treatment algorithm for refractory patients because of its better risk/benefit profile compared with clozapine. Clozapine, however, remains our gold standard in the management of these patients.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Therefore clonidine and midazolam were used for premedication in maxillo-facial surgery under total intravenous anesthesia, and the perioperative courses were analyzed.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty patients (ASA 1-2) were included in the present doubleblinded, prospective study. 60-90 minutes preoperatively these patients got an oral premedication with 5 micrograms kg-1 clonidine or 100 micrograms kg-1 midazolam. For anaesthesia a standardized procedure with propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium was performed. After induction of anaesthesia the infusion of remifentanil was regulated by using spectral edge frequency (target-SEF90, 10-13 Hz). The efficiency of the premedication as well as the emergence and recovery were assessed by using established standardized tests. The perioperative stress response was assessed by recording the effects on haemodynamic parameters (NIBP. heart rate. Holter-ECG).\n\n\nRESULTS\nReferring to the effects of premedication (sedation, anxiety) there were no differences between the groups. The clonidine group required a lower remifentanil rate in keeping a steady-target-SEF90 (-24%). The time until emergence and recovery was not significantly different. Even the occurrence of PONV, VAS or the postoperative analgetic requirement did not differ between the two groups. However, the incidence of postoperative shivering was significantly higher in the midazolam group. Intraoperatively the values of MAP were quite equal between the groups. However, heart rate was significantly lower in the clonidine group. Postoperatively both MAP as well as heart rate were lower in the clonidine group. Furthermore, in the midazolam group there was a significantly higher cumulative duration of tachycardia (heart rate > 100 min-1; following descripted as medium with 25% and 75%-percentage; clonidine: 29/0/563 sec.: midazolam: 1058/232/3171 sec.).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAfter remifentanil supplemented anesthesia there is, especially in the postoperative period, a benefit in using clonidine compared to the premedication with midazolam.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29364538"], "label": "0"}

It has been proven effective and significantly superior to placebo, as well as to conventional neuroleptics, in several placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. It has also been found to produce an incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) as low as that found with placebo. Approximately 30-60% of all schizophrenic patients who fail to respond to typical antipsychotics may respond to clozapine. It was the first major advance that marked a turning point in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders since the introduction of the typical antipsychotic agents, i.e., chlorpromazine and haloperidol in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. After its introduction in clinical studies in the United States in the early 1970s, it was withdrawn in 1974, and was not approved for clinical use in the United States until February 1990, because of the risk of agranulocytosis. Its novel pharmacological profile, lack of propensity to cause EPS in both short- and long-term uses, lack of effects on serum prolactin, and ameliorative effects on tardive dyskinesia have resulted in the expansion of its use from refractory schizophrenia to schizoaffective disorders, affective disorders, some neurological disorders, aggression, as well as psychosis in patients with dementia and parkinsonism.

Approximately 60% to 70% of women undergoing the climacteric report hot flashes (1). Hot flashes are also the most common side effect associated with use of the antiestrogen tamoxifen; in a recent study, 57% of 1318 women with breast cancer who were receiving the drug reported hot flashes (2). Although most women tolerate this symptom and are able to remain active, others find it distressing. Hot flashes have been reported to interfere with daily activities and sleep, and some women have considered discontinuing therapy or have been less compliant with their daily tamoxifen regimen. These problems have become more pronounced because long-term tamoxifen therapy is now advocated for early-stage breast cancer. It is important to address the continuing problem of vasomotor side effects associated with tamoxifen therapy. The pathophysiology underlying hot flashes is not entirely clear. Casper and Yen (3) have hypothesized that physiologic levels of estrogen and progesterone maintain endogenous opioid peptide concentrations in the hypothalamus and brain stem. At menopause, these concentrations decrease with decreasing estrogen levels, which releases nonadrenergic activity from its usual tonic inhibition and causes nonadrenergic hyperactivity. This leads to inappropriate activation of the heat loss mechanism in the medial preoptic area and subsequent hot flashes. Clonidine hydrochloride is a centrally active -adrenergic agonist that reduces vascular reactivity and is currently used to treat hypertension. Its reported side effects include dry mouth and sleepiness. Several studies have examined its effectiveness in controlling hot flashes caused by natural or surgical menopause. Wren and Brown (4) reported no benefit of clonidine therapy in a placebo-controlled trial, but Clayden and colleagues (5) and Edington and coworkers (6) demonstrated significant benefit in patients receiving oral clonidine. In a dose-escalation study by Laufer and coworkers (7), 10 women received two daily doses of clonidine, starting with 0.1 mg/d and increasing to 0.2 mg/d and 0.4 mg/d. Each dose level was maintained for 2 weeks. Four of the 10 participants withdrew because of side effects: 1 at 0.1 mg/d, 1 at 0.2 mg/d, and 2 at 0.4 mg/d. Increasing benefit was noted with increasing dose: At the maximum dose, hot flashes decreased by 46%. In a more recent study, transdermal clonidine was found to be of some benefit for tamoxifen-induced hot flashes (8). A double-blind crossover pilot study of clonidine, 0.1 mg, or placebo given at bedtime was conducted at the University of Rochester Cancer Center in Rochester, New York (9). Fifteen women receiving tamoxifen for breast cancer entered the study. Of the 13 evaluable women, 9 (69%) preferred clonidine, 2 (15%) had no preference, and 2 (15%) preferred placebo. No adverse side effects, including any related to blood pressure, were reported. The clonidine and placebo groups did not differ significantly with regard to number of hot flashes. However, because the sample was too small and the duration of treatment too short, differences between treatments could not be reliably detected. We performed a larger randomized, controlled trial that studied the effect of clonidine on hot flashes in women receiving tamoxifen for breast cancer. Methods Our study was conducted by the University of Rochester Cancer Center and its affiliates under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute's Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP). Patients who met eligibility criteria were recruited from clinical practices of medical oncologists from participating CCOPs. Postmenopausal women who had been receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer for at least 1 month and reported at least one hot flash per day were eligible. Premenopausal women and women receiving concurrent chemotherapy or other endocrine therapy for breast cancer were ineligible. Patients receiving hypertension therapy or concurrent treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors; l-dopa; piribedil; tricyclic antidepressants; or sedatives, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates, were also ineligible. Patients with coronary insufficiency, recent history of myocardial infarction (within the past 3 months), symptomatic cardiac disease, peripheral or cerebrovascular disease, syncope, or symptomatic hypotension were excluded, as were those with a history of allergy or adverse reaction to clonidine. Normal hepatic and renal function were required. Each patient signed an informed consent document approved by the institutional review board of the participating affiliate. The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Bethesda, Maryland, funded all aspects of the study as part of their CCOP. The study was designed, conducted, peer reviewed, and approved at the University of Rochester Cancer Center, a designated research base for CCOP. The University of Rochester Institutional Review Board approved the study. Treatment Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral clonidine, 0.1 mg, or placebo at bedtime for 8 weeks. Randomization was done by using a computer program maintained by the University of Rochester Department of Biostatistics and was stratified by time since menopause ( 3 years,>3 years), duration of tamoxifen therapy ( 1 year,>1 year), and baseline frequency of hot flashes (<10 per day, 10 per day). Doses were not modified during the study. Patients or physicians could discontinue treatment for any reason. If treatment was discontinued, the reason was recorded on the appropriate study forms. Treatment Evaluation Self-report methods were used because the patient's evaluation of symptoms was of principal importance and greatest clinical relevance (10). We obtained data on hot flashes by asking patients to keep a daily diary for 1 week at baseline, during the 4th and 8th weeks of treatment, and during the 4th week after the end of treatment (the 12th week after randomization). The diary consisted of self-administered questionnaires on the number, duration, and severity of hot flashes. Severity was recorded as mild, moderate, severe, or very severe, similar to that reported by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (8). A separate symptom checklist was used to monitor 18 potential side effects, as adapted from the drug surveillance literature and used in previous studies (11). Potential symptoms were difficulty sleeping, decreased appetite, constipation, diarrhea, hair loss, headache, eye sensitivity to light, dry mouth, night sweats, pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, stress incontinence, change in sense of taste or smell, drowsiness, dizziness, and hot flashes. We also asked patients to rate their lives on a scale from 1 (worst possible life) to 10 (best possible life) at each assessment. A brief history and physical examination, including blood pressure measurement, were done at each assessment. Statistical Analysis Four measures of hot flash symptoms were used to assess treatment effectiveness: frequency, mean severity grade (calculated by assigning scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, to mild, moderate, severe, and very severe hot flashes), a combined score obtained by multiplying the mean frequency by the mean severity grade, and mean duration. Symptoms during the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks were expressed as percentage changes from the baseline week for each woman, and the Wilcoxon test was used to test for differences between the clonidine and placebo groups. Patients' ratings of quality of life at each assessment were expressed as changes from the baseline score, and the Wilcoxon test was used to test for a difference between the clonidine and placebo groups. Repeated measures of analysis of variance were used to test for differences in treatment effects between weeks 4 and 8. Two-way analysis of variance was used to test for differences in treatment effect between subgroups defined by time since menopause, duration of tamoxifen therapy, or baseline frequency of hot flashes. We used SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and S-PLUS (MathSoft, Inc., Seattle, Washington) statistical software. All P values are two-sided. Patients reported occurrence and severity of 18 side effects on a scale from 0 (not at all severe) to 4 (extremely severe). The data were summarized as the peak severity of each symptom during treatment minus its baseline severity. Between-group differences were compared by using the Wilcoxon test. Results The flow of patients is shown in Figure 1. We randomly assigned 198 women to receive clonidine or placebo. Four women did not provide baseline information about hot flashes and thus were considered unevaluable. The 194 evaluable patients in the clonidine and placebo groups were similar with respect to mean age (53 years compared with 55 years [range, 35 to 77 years]; P =0.15), duration of tamoxifen use (>1 year, 39% compared with 35%; P >0.2), and time since menopause (>3 years, 58% compared with 62%; P >0.2). Forty-five of 194 patients (23%) did not complete the full 12 weeks of the study, and 31 (16%) did not complete the 8-week intervention period. Dropout rates were similar in the two groups and were due to patient preference. Baseline characteristics (age, hot flash symptoms, duration of tamoxifen therapy, time since menopause, and quality-of-life score) were generally similar in patients who completed the study and those who did not. Only one difference was statistically significant: Patients who dropped out had a shorter mean duration of hot flashes at baseline than did the 149 patients who completed the study. Figure 1. Flow of participants. During the baseline week, the mean frequency of hot flashes among the two groups was 8.0 (median, 6.7) per day in the clonidine group and 7.4 (medi", "outbound_citations": ["9469333", "8028614", "8270972", "2644532", "3515137", "3884189", "7145250", "7289887", "6998552", "7407784", "1153148", "4854952", "4593554"], "inbound_citations": ["36749328", "36820056", "36470539", "35717745", "35232827", "35688488", "34779371", "34251902", "33891888", "33823682", "33739313", "32746689", "32344759", "31312148", "31151571", "31151569", "29332222", "29176439", "28891773", "28643614", "27960127", "28503254", "27709351", "27819386", "27497608", "27492917", "27418936", "26050143", "26240945"], "label": "0"}

Therefore, studies of comparative bioavailability of different formulations of a same drug are worthwhile.\n\n\nAIM\nTo compare the bioavailability of two risperidone formulations available in the Chilean market.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe bioavailability of a local risperidone formulation (Spiron) was compared with the original formulation of the drug (Risperdal) in 12 healthy volunteers, aged 19 +/- 1 years. A single dose of 3 mg was given orally, using a randomized double blind protocol in two periods. Fifteen blood samples were obtained at regular intervals, until 24 h after drug administration. Risperidone plasma levels were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography. pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a computer program that is independent of compartmental analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe area under the curve of plasma concentration versus time, from 0 to infinite (ABC0-infinity) and from 0 to 24 h (ABC0-24), early exposure (ABC from 0 to maximal time) and maximal plasma concentrations were significantly lower for Spiron. Half life time and time to achieve the maximal concentration were similar for the two formulations.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAccording to bioequivalence tests suggested by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States (90% confidence interval for the difference of long transformed mean pharmacokinetic parameters), the formulations Risperdal and Spiron, cannot be considered interchangeable.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

This is not only due to the addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, but also because of psychological and social factors. Approximately 80% of the people who have used nicotine-replacement therapy return to smoking after some time. Therefore, the interest in non-nicotine pharmacotherapy has increased considerably in recent years. The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline are, compared to a placebo, particularly effective smoking cessation aids (relative risk (RR)nortriptyline: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.3-5.3; RRbupropion: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.6). A combined strategy of nicotine-replacement therapy with counselling or antidepressants (bupropion or nortriptyline) with counselling, in which the physiological as well as the psychological aspects of smoking cessation are treated, seems to be the most effective. Although smoking cessation is seen as the single most important way of preventing a further deterioration of the lung function at all stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), little research has been conducted amongst COPD patients. Especially the use of the antidepressants bupropion or nortriptyline seems particularly interesting for the treatment of patients with COPD. This is not only because smoking cigarettes is the major risk factor for the development of the disease, but also because COPD patients have a higher than normal prevalence of depression. Furthermore, an association has been found between smoking cigarettes and depression, and the presence of depression or depressive symptoms appears to be an important cause of relapse.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Method: Participants in the study were the parents of 81 children who reached diagnostic criteria for ADHD and who were referred to a treatment study of ADHD involving stimulant medication and parent groups. The mothers completed a modified version of the ADHD Knowledge and Opinion Scale (AKOS) prior to receiving diagnostic feedback and prior to the families' decisions to participate in a 12-month randomized trial (medication [methylphenidate or placebo] and parent groups [training or support]). Treatment enrolment and adherence were monitored over the 12-month trial, and families who remained in the study at 12 months completed another modified AKOS. Results: A higher level of knowledge of ADHD was found to be related to more favourable opinions of parent groups but not of medication. Moreover, parents who were more knowledgeable about ADHD were more likely to enrol in both pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments. Adherence to pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments was not predicted by parental knowledge of ADHD or opinions of the treatment. Conclusion: Parents' knowledge of ADHD and opinions of treatments play a significant role in enrolment in treatments for their children with ADHD.

In both groups, propofol infusion was reduced to 30 to 60 microg/kg/min at skin closure and stopped when assisted spontaneous breathing led to adequate gas exchange.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nThe main outcomes were recovery times; somatic variables; plasma catecholamine levels; and self-recorded pain, nausea, and vomiting. Patients in the remifentanil-clonidine group were extubated earlier and had lower plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. After transitional analgesia, the remifentanil-clonidine patients had similar postoperative analgesic use and self-reported pain and side-effect scores.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCompared with a sufentanil-propofol regimen, an anesthetic regimen for CABG surgery that combines remifentanil, clonidine, and propofol provides similar hemodynamics. The remifentanil-clonidine regimen reduces catecholamine levels and hastens recovery from anesthesia.", "outbound_citations": ["11323328", "11323325", "11323327", "11575336", "11270028", "10910490", "10972607", "10823100", "10691215", "10698389", "10490157", "10470749", "10069276", "9631781", "9620525", "9105228", "8800165", "8694306", "7818111", "5534693"], "inbound_citations": ["35356663", "34976328", "30870677", "30663045", "28774327", "27616189"], "label": "0"}

Sixty ASA 1 or 2 patients scheduled for elective orthopaedic limb surgery were randomly allocated to group 1, who received 150 micrograms clonidine iv, or group 2, who received a saline bolus iv, before induction. In all patients, anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol and maintained by spontaneous respiration (via a laryngeal mask airway) of oxygen, nitrous oxide and enflurane. Core (nasopharyngeal) and peripheral (dorsal hand) temperatures were recorded at induction and 15-min intervals. Nurses, unaware of the treatment groups, recorded visible shivering in the recovery room. When cognitive function returned, patients were asked to grade their perception of cold on a 10 cm linear analogue scale, higher scores indicating heat discomfort. While core temperature decreased and peripheral temperature increased in both groups, there was no difference between the groups at any time. However, there was a lower incidence of shivering in the clonidine group (20% vs 66.7%, P < 0.001). Patients receiving clonidine felt warmer; thermal comfort score (median interquartile range) 5.9 (5.0-7.2) vs 5.0 (4.5-6.0), P < 0.05).

Patients were monitored weekly by three methods of extrapyramidal symptom assessment: (1) detection of extrapyramidal adverse events (signs and symptoms) by casual observation, nonprobing inquiry, and spontaneous report; (2) objective rating scale scores: and (3) use of concomitant anticholinergic medications. Emergence of EPS was assessed by (1) analysis of the incidence of extrapyramidal syndrome categories based on adverse events, (2) the incidence of extrapyramidal syndromes based on categorical analysis of rating scale scores, (3) analysis of mean maximum change in rating scale scores, and (4) categorical analysis of anticholinergic medication use. Outcome of EPS was assessed by (1) analysis of mean change in rating scale scores at endpoint and (2) mean anticholinergic use at endpoint.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOlanzapine was statistically significantly (p = .014, p < .001) superior to haloperidol in all four analyses related to emergence of EPS and in the two analyses related to outcome. Furthermore, during acute treatment, statistically significantly fewer patients treated with olanzapine (0.3%) discontinued the study because of any extrapyramidal adverse event than patients treated with haloperidol (2.7%, p < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOlanzapine exhibited a statistically significantly lower extrapyramidal symptom profile than the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol at comparably effective antipsychotic doses. The lower extrapyramidal symptom profile with olanzapine was evident despite statistically significantly more frequent use of anticholinergic drugs among haloperidol-treated patients.

Method In a multi-national, parallel-group, double-blind study, patients with chronic schizophrenia (DSM\u2013III\u2013R) were randomly assigned to risperidone 1, 4, 8, 12 or 16 mg or haloperidol 10 mg daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia (PANSS) and clinical global impression (CGI), and safety primarily by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS). Results One thousand three hundred and sixty-two patients were evaluated. The optimum risperidone doses were 4 mg and 8 mg, with response rates of 63.4% (56.8%; 69.7%) and 65.8% (59.2%; 71.9%) respectively. Response rate in haloperidol-treated patients was 58.7% (52.0%; 65.3%); the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the differences between risperidone 4 mg or 8 mg and haloperidol were (\u20134.3%; 13.7%) and (\u20131.9%; 16.0%) respectively. There were no significant differences in CGI scores at endpoint between risperidone 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg and 16 mg and haloperidol (3.0, 3.0, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.1 respectively); the 95% CI of the differences between risperidone 4 mg or 8 mg and haloperidol were (\u20130.4; 0.1) and (\u20130.3; 0.2) respectively. Mean shifts to the maximum total ESRS scores versus baseline (mean (confidence interval)) were significantly greater in haloperidol-treated patients (5.1 (4.0; 6.2)) than in the risperidone 1, 4, 8 and 12 mg groups (1.1 (0.3; 1.9); 1.8 (0.9; 2.7); 2.7 (1.8; 3.6) and 3.2 (2.3; 4.1) respectively (P< 0.05)). Conclusion Risperidone is an effective antipsychotic for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia; doses of 4 and 8 mg seem to be optimal and have a lower incidence of side-effects than haloperidol.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36619589", "34390232", "34096837", "32415847", "31711954", "31303314", "30093698", "29982701", "29915922", "29581800", "28735640", "28183293", "27977041", "27648956", "27307984", "26869182"], "label": "0"}

Customarily we just treat it rather than prevent it. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of oral clonidine as a premedication to prevent post-spinal shivering.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred males of ASA physical status I-III, aged above 40, scheduled for elective urological surgery under spinal anesthesia, were included in this study. All participants were randomly divided into the clonidine and control groups. They received either oral clonidine 150 micrograms (n = 48) or placebo (n = 52) 90 min before spinal anesthesia in a double-blind fashion. Spinal blockade was induced with heavy bupivacaine to a dermatomal level near T10. The shivering was graded as: none, no perceptible tension of muscles observed; mild, slight muscle tonus (masseter muscle); moderate, real shivering (proximal muscles); and severe, generalized shivering (whole body). The tympanic membrane temperature was recorded 30 min after spinal anesthesia. Data were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. Chi-square and Student's t-test were used. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of post-spinal shivering, which was graded as none, mild, moderate, and severe, showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between clonidine 150 micrograms and placebo (83% vs. 42%, 10% vs. 6%, 10% vs. 19%, 0% vs. 33%, respectively) during the 30 min immediately after spinal anesthesia. The respective mean tympanic temperature in oral clonidine and placebo groups showed no difference (clonidine vs. control = 35.9 +/- 0.8 degrees C vs. 35.9 +/- 0.7 degrees C).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPre-anesthetic medication with oral clonidine 150 micrograms is effective to prevent post-spinal shivering in patients undergoing elective urological surgery.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32876405"], "label": "0"}

The occurrence of shivering was documented clinically during recovery by nursing staff, who were unaware of the group assignment. PAS occurred in 16 of 28 (57%) patients in Group C, compared with 9 of 27 (33%) in Group O4 (P = 0.13) and 4 of 27 (15%) patients in Group O8 (P = 0.003). Within each group, core temperature decreased and peripheral temperature increased significantly, but there were no significant differences among the groups at any time interval. We conclude that ondansetron 8 mg IV given during the induction of anesthesia prevents PAS without affecting the core-to-peripheral redistribution of heat during general anesthesia. This suggests that serotonergic pathways have a role in the regulation of PAS. Implications In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical study, ondansetron 8 mg IV, given just before the induction, reduced the incidence of postanesthetic shivering compared with saline. The anticipated core-to-peripheral redistribution of body temperature during general anesthesia was not affected. This implies that ondansetron probably acts by a central inhibitory mechanism, and that 5-hydroxytryptaminergic pathways have a role in regulating postanesthetic shivering.", "outbound_citations": ["10195549", "10072029", "9886687", "9778005", "9661569", "9447863", "9389278", "9389849", "9150780", "9067044", "9052312", "7879935", "7946870", "8155437", "8267194", "8251281", "8363079", "8500688", "1928769", "2048663", "7094436", "4647160"], "inbound_citations": ["37180300", "35256345", "32084066", "33075160", "31274602", "31734098", "32127847", "30945105", "31031474", "29362045", "28546012", "28715610", "28663645", "27628928", "28663651", "27856931", "27632391", "27138855", "27212768", "27396224", "26383882", "25980843", "26342782", "25908099"], "label": "0"}

Outcomes were assessed in multiple domains before and during treatment and at treatment end point (with the combined treatment and medication management groups continuing medication at all assessment points). Data were analyzed through intent-to-treat random-effects regression procedures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll 4 groups showed sizable reductions in symptoms over time, with significant differences among them in degrees of change. For most ADHD symptoms, children in the combined treatment and medication management groups showed significantly greater improvement than those given intensive behavioral treatment and community care. Combined and medication management treatments did not differ significantly on any direct comparisons, but in several instances (oppositional/aggressive symptoms, internalizing symptoms, teacher-rated social skills, parent-child relations, and reading achievement) combined treatment proved superior to intensive behavioral treatment and/or community care while medication management did not. Study medication strategies were superior to community care treatments, despite the fact that two thirds of community-treated subjects received medication during the study period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor ADHD symptoms, our carefully crafted medication management was superior to behavioral treatment and to routine community care that included medication. Our combined treatment did not yield significantly greater benefits than medication management for core ADHD symptoms, but may have provided modest advantages for non-ADHD symptom and positive functioning outcomes.", "outbound_citations": ["10230187", "9648036", "9648041", "9294377", "9294378", "9183129", "9100431", "8951257", "8885584", "8800609", "8919704", "8735023", "7665456",

Subjects received either oral diltiazem (60 mg) and placebo, placebo and dcxtroamphetamine (20 mg), diltiazem and dextroamphetamine, or placebo alone. Subjective and sleep changes were measured using visual analogue scales. Attentiveness and visual reaction times were measured repeatedly as were diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The results showed that dextroamphelamine alone produced a number of subjective changes, cardiovascular changes and changes in reaction time. Diltiazem significantly attenuated the cardiovascular changes, but not the subjective or reaction time changes. It is hypothesized that these findings may represent effects of diltiazem on noradrenergic neurotransmission.

We have investigated the use of this drug in myotonic dystrophy patients with excess daytime sleepiness. Patients were recruited from a clinic population on the basis of screening with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.

The primary outcome measures were change in both the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and a modified Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, which were measured at the start of each arm of the trial and in week 3 of each intervention period. In agreement with previous smaller studies, sleepiness is not correlated with CTG expansion size. Treatment with modafinil showed a non-significant reduction in median Epworth Sleepiness Scale. However, the median Maintenance of Wakefulness Test score was prolonged by treatment (31.7-40 min, P=0.006). There were no significant adverse cardiac effects of the drug in this group of patients (resting 12 lead and 24 h ECG monitoring).

Data concerning improvement of psychosis and worsening of motor function was based on Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) and Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPsychotic symptoms were improved in all patients. In most of them the improvement was almost total. Seven patients increased levodopa dose on OLZ, but significant worsening of motor function was reported just in one patient. None of the patients had agranulocytosis in the blood monitoring. Two patients presented weight gain. Seven patients improved their cognitive status.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe conclude that OLZ at the doses studied may have efficacy for DIP which appears in PD and does not induce worsening of motor function in most of the patients.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29093347"], "label": "0"}

The proportion of patients showing clinical improvement; use of medications for extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS); the treatment drop-out rates; and the changes in negative PANSS scores were measured. Compared with conventional neuroleptics, slightly more patients in the risperidone group showed clinical improvement [57 vs 52%; odds ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.56]. The use of concomitant medications for EPS was significantly less in the risperidone group than in the conventional neuroleptic group (22.8 vs 38.4%; odds ratio 0.51, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.63). The overall drop-out rate was lower in the risperidone group than in other neuroleptic group (29.1 vs 33.9%; odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.94). The difference in changes in negative PANSS score between the risperidone and the haloperidol group was -0.74 (95% CI: -1.50, 0.02). Weight gain and tachycardia are more common in patients treated with risperidone. Sensitivity analysis of different analytic approaches did not materially change the main estimates. It was concluded that the short-term efficacy of risperidone is comparable to other neuroleptics in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Data from prospective controlled trials with methodologically sound end points corresponding to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, were abstracted by 2 independent reviewers and underwent meta-analysis.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nBenzodiazepines reduce withdrawal severity, reduce incidence of delirium (-4.9 cases per 100 patients; 95% confidence interval, -9.0 to -0.7; P=.04), and reduce seizures (-7.7 seizures per 100 patients; 95% confidence interval, -12.0 to -3.5; P=.003). Individualizing therapy with withdrawal scales results in administration of significantly less medication and shorter treatment (P<.001). beta-Blockers, clonidine, and carbamazepine ameliorate withdrawal severity, but evidence is inadequate to determine their effect on delirium and seizures. Phenothiazines ameliorate withdrawal but are less effective than benzodiazepines in reducing delirium (P=.002) or seizures (P<.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBenzodiazepines are suitable agents for alcohol withdrawal, with choice among different agents guided by duration of action, rapidity of onset, and cost. Dosage should be individualized, based on withdrawal severity measured by withdrawal scales, comorbid illness, and history of withdrawal seizures. beta-Blockers, clonidine, carbamazepine, and neuroleptics may be used as adjunctive therapy but are not recommended as monotherapy.", "outbound_citations": ["7474220", "8616462", "7573789", "7491383", "7804089", "7997390", "7997391", "7978098", "8174516", "7960461", "8189026", "8198220", "8284718", "8192130", "7960466", "8192136", "8246319", "8262577", "1613678", "1524606", "1739547", "1684974", "2025144", "2003725", "2000517", "2044037", "1678735", "2136211", "2226285", "1981067", "2217011", "2343598", "2114376", "2334301", "2178476", "2388312", "2231826", "2664886", "2597811", "2571021", "2779242", "2653057", "2500138", "2719503", "2646983", "2909780", "2691421", "2655625", "2606608", "3244064", "3044163", "3289648", "3342636", "3276009", "3328869", "3619162", "3300587", "3306440", "3943408", "3816528", "3802833", "3020662", "3463146", "3779234", "3458493", "3741551", "3529830", "3529829", "2863754", "2859274", "3893195", "4030178", "3978501", "3979072", "2858114", "3890587", "3887964", "4034881", "3902038", "6393805", "6465435", "6730996", "6703291", "6702419", "6378439", "6548969", "6722863", "6641099", "6627822", "6872416", "6875027", "6342448", "6370437", "6820674", "6749909", "6122874", "7047258", "7064002", "6121694", "7034468", "7232246", "7004240", "7404309", "6107818", "6108298", "573384", "298346", "287514", "378726", "422531", "35883", "358756", "352467", "633543", "205633", "592834", "822987", "181193", "785949", "1103576", "804705", "4796341", "5087452", "5259581", "4890289", "5188537", "6072348", "5935217", "14321047", "14114006", "13829805", "13554776"], "inbound_citations": ["37100434", "36425749", "35954565", "35529779", "35224452", "35219012", "35001019", "34823734", "34565191", "34009313", "33503582", "33407346", "35210682", "32862442", "32851920", "33242344", "32794143", "32648800", "32418843", "32402500", "32317593", "32209957", "32850046", "32199629", "31947749", "31122170", "32116660", "31490712", "31630982", "31789766", "31835144", "31771785", "31689723", "31645232", "30876654", "31173120", "31046129", "30990361", "30937668", "30858636", "30718931", "30632868", "30745655", "30507660", "30680347", "30522144", "30568343", "30564004", "30357930", "30187438", "28981333", "29933817", "29719204", "29958050", "29529713", "29458796", "29491698", "29336434", "29349862", "28811138", "30528859", "29281047", "28645616", "28898879", "28822350", "28188055", "28601135", "28492463", "28266937", "28365836", "28006997", "28096011", "28101764", "27749004", "27798661", "27613346", "27319379", "27488204", "27484692", "27184605", "27159343", "28082828", "26821293", "26893017", "26922279", "27002553", "26861990", "26840871", "26941206", "26830178", "26768685", "26822361", "26501787", "26400008", "26339207", "26500991", "25620568", "26314552", "26147274", "25951876", "26302015", "25999438", "25895020", "25559647", "25747925", "26405310"], "label": "0"}

In anesthetized children, epinephrine and isoproterenol are reliable indicators to detect accidental intravascular injection of a test dose. Oral clonidine, a useful premedicant in pediatric anesthesia, modifies hemodynamic responses to sympathomimetics, including catecholamines. The aim of the current study was to determine whether oral clonidine premedication alters the efficacy of a simulated intravascular test dose containing epinephrine or isoproterenol in sevoflurane-anesthetized children. MethodsOne hundred twenty children (aged 1\u20137 yr) were randomly divided into six groups; control\u2013saline, control\u2013epinephrine, control\u2013isoproterenol, clonidine\u2013saline, clonidine\u2013epinephrine, and clonidine\u2013isoproterenol. The three clonidine groups received oral clonidine 4 mg/kg as premedication, whereas the three control groups did not receive any premedication. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane at a level of 1.2 minimum alveolar concentration. After hemodynamics were stable, 0.1 ml/kg of 1% lidocaine containing epinephrine 0.5 mg/kg or isoproterenol 75 ng/kg was intravenously given to the two epinephrine or isoproterenol groups, respectively, to simulate intravascular injection of a test dose. The saline groups received saline alone instead of the test dose. Heart rate, blood pressure, and T-wave amplitude of electrocardiogram were recorded before and after administration of study drugs for subsequent analysis. ResultsTest solution containing epinephrine increased heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and T-wave amplitude. Oral clonidine had no effect on elevation of these variables in response to epinephrine. The isoproterenol-containing test dose produced a prominent increase in heart rate and a less pronounced increase in systolic blood pressure and T-wave amplitude. Oral clonidine also failed to modify isoproterenol-induced hemodynamic and T-wave changes. Calculated sensitivity and specificity of epinephrine or isoproterenol were all 100% based on a new heart rate criterion (positive if \u2265 10 beats/min) and were unaltered by oral clonidine premedication. ConclusionsEpinephrine or isoproterenol is a reliable marker to detect accidental intravascular injection of a test dose with 100% sensitivity and specificity based on a new heart rate criterion in sevoflurane-anesthetized children. These data suggest that oral clonidine premedication does not alter the efficacy of a simulated epidural test dose containing epinephrine or isoproterenol.", "outbound_citations": ["10475293", "10195518", "9728825", "9585275", "9585287", "9286892", "8825545", "7577287", "7605024", "7741287", "8024136", "8122727", "2008952", "1672060", "1975483", "2405737", "7305059", "760603"], "inbound_citations": ["36029118", "28033670", "26192549"], "label": "0"}

The present study investigates the efficacy of both clozapine and risperidone on psychopathologic and neurocognitive measures in a prospective 12-week open-label trial in treatment-refractory schizophrenic patients from state psychiatric hospitals.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThirty-five DSM-IV schizophrenic patients with a documented history of nonresponse to typical neuroleptics were treated with either clozapine or risperidone. Response was assessed every 2 weeks by independent raters with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, neurologic rating scales, and plasma drug levels. Neurocognitive tests were administered at baseline and week 12.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth clozapine and risperidone brought about significant (p < .003) overall improvement in psychopathology. However, clozapine was numerically superior to risperidone on PANSS total scores and PANSS positive, negative, excitement, and cognitive factors. Extrapyramidal side effects were minimal for clozapine, whereas some were present for risperidone. Patients taking risperidone improved significantly in the beginning stages of the study and remained stable thereafter. Patients taking clozapine showed a gradual improvement that occurred over the entire length of the trial. Neurocognitive measures showed minimal improvement and did not differentiate between the 2 medication groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBoth clozapine and risperidone were comparably effective across a wide spectrum of psychopathologic measures. While the efficacy of clozapine was only numerically superior to that of risperidone, it was associated with fewer extrapyramidal side effects and with progressive improvement over the 12-week treatment period, suggesting that in longer trials clozapine may prove to be superior to risperidone in neuroleptic-refractory patients.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32945023", "31365048", "30581395", "28240152", "27173157", "27648956", "27301766", "26564550", "26273202", "25859763", "25568968"], "label": "0"}

In this study, we reviewed data on the electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities in patients treated with clozapine.\n\n\nMETHOD\nSixty-one patients treated with clozapine were selected from the Seoul National University Hospital Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia Clinic. A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify ECG abnormalities and cardiovascular side effects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of ECG abnormalities in patients who had been using antipsychotics other than clozapine was 13.6% at baseline, which increased significantly to 31.1% after commencement of clozapine treatment. Among the 53 patients without baseline ECG abnormalities, 13 showed new-onset ECG abnormalities after using clozapine. Normal ECG under previous antipsychotic medication reduced the risk of new-onset ECG abnormalities, whereas increased age was found to increase the risk. The occurrence of orthostatic hypotension or tachycardia was not related to the development of ECG abnormalities. Most of the newly developed abnormalities had little clinical significance, and they tended to occur during the initial phase of treatment. In 10 patients, ECGs normalized despite the continued use of clozapine. Clozapine increased corrected QT interval (QTc) in a dose-dependent fashion; however, the clinical significance of this observation is uncertain. Pathologic prolongation of QTc was found to be rare.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough a substantial portion of patients treated with clozapine developed ECG abnormalities, most of the abnormalities were benign and did not hinder further treatment.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34992373", "34046160", "33438863", "33142804", "33098837", "32289791", "29796248", "29252168", "28481767", "27276059", "27222142", "26024250"], "label": "0"}

Oxygen and naloxone (5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) were administered, respectively, if more than three episodes of oxygen saturation less than 90% were observed within 10 min and if PaCO2 was higher than 50 mm Hg. Pain relief, sedation, and ketoprofen requirements were similar in both groups. The number of episodes of arterial desaturation less than 90% (> 20 s) was 106 for four patients in the fentanyl group (versus none in the clonidine-fentanyl group).

The relative efficacy of interventions that are used for the treatment of postoperative shivering is not well understood. We performed a systematic search (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, hand searching, all languages, to August, 2000) for full reports of randomized comparisons of any pharmacological antishivering intervention (active) with placebo (control) in the postoperative period. Dichotomous data on absence of further shivering after treatment and adverse effects were extracted from original reports. Relative risk (RR) and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) were calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed effect model. Data from 20 trials (944 adults received an active intervention, 413 were controls) were analyzed. Antishivering efficacy depended on the active regimen and the length of follow-up. Efficacy with meperidine 25 mg, clonidine 150 &mgr;g, ketanserin 10 mg, and doxapram 100 mg was reported in at least three trials; all were significantly more effective than control. After 1 min, the NNT of meperidine 25 mg for no further shivering compared with placebo was 2.7 (RR, 6.8; 95% CI, 2.5\u201318.5). After 5 min, the NNT of meperidine 25 mg was 1.3 (RR, 9.6; 95% CI, 5.7\u201316), the NNT of clonidine 150 &mgr;g was 1.3 (RR, 6.8; 95% CI, 3.3\u201314.2), the NNT of doxapram 100 mg was 1.7 (RR 4.0; 95% CI, 2.4\u20136.5), and the NNT of ketanserin 10 mg was 2.3 (RR 3.1; 95% CI, 1.9\u20135.1).

Clozapine has been one treatment option; however, it is not universally effective and is limited in its use by safety concerns. With the introduction of newer agents, their performance relative to clozapine is of great clinical interest. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine versus clozapine among treatment resistant DSM-IV schizophrenic patients. The study was primarily designed to demonstrate the \"noninferiority\" of olanzapine compared to clozapine after 18 weeks of double-blind treatment. Conclusions were based on the one-sided lower 95% confidence limit about the treatment effect observed from the primary efficacy variable (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] Total). Mean changes from baseline to end point in PANSS Total score, using a last observation carried forward technique, showed that both agents were comparably effective in neuroleptic resistant patients, i.e., demonstrated the \"noninferiority\" of olanzapine when compared to clozapine. Overall, significantly fewer olanzapine-treated patients (4%) discontinued for an adverse event than their clozapine-treated (14%) counterparts (p =.022). Among spontaneously reported adverse events, increased salivation, constipation, dizziness, and nausea were reported significantly more often among clozapine-treated patients, whereas only dry mouth was reported more often among olanzapine-treated patients.

Treatment efficacy was measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, The Clinical Global Impressions scale, and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale. Fine motor functions were assessed using a computerized device (the Vienna Test System) and were compared with those of a control group of 20 healthy subjects who were matched for age, gender, and educational level.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment with doses of 2 and 4 mg of risperidone daily significantly reduced positive (p < .0001) and negative (p < .01) symptoms at 8 weeks. Although there were no significant differences in motor movements as measured using the Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Simpson-Angus Scale, computerized fine motor assessment showed significantly less motor dysfunction in the 2-mg/day group at 8 weeks. No significant correlations to plasma concentration of active moiety were found for data on psychopathology and fine motor functions.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe 2 doses of risperidone did not differ in terms of clinical improvement, but the 2-mg/day dose produced fewer fine motor dysfunctions. These results suggest that a dose as low as 2 mg/day of risperidone may be effective for patients with first-episode psychosis.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37201154", "33257137", "30772732", "29909790", "29909790", "29369974", "28867897", "27863801", "27821411", "27489380", "27334812"], "label": "0"}

The purpose of the current study was to examine the interaction between intrathecal neostigmine and epidural clonidine for analgesia and side effects in humans. Methods A total of 58 volunteers received an intrathecal injection of 5% dextrose in normal saline (D5NS) or neostigmine (50, 100, or 200 micro gram in D5NS), followed in 1 h by epidural saline or clonidine (computer\u2010controlled infusion targeted to 50, 100, 200, or 400 ng/ml in cerebrospinal fluid) using an isobolographic design. Visual analog scale pain to a noxious cold stimulus, nausea, weakness, sedation, and other safety variables was measured before and at specified intervals after drug administration. Results The first 21 volunteers randomized to receive intrathecal hyperbaric neostigmine rather than D5NS received the drug while in the sitting position, and had none\u2010to\u2010minimal analgesia 1 h later. The remaining volunteers received the drug while in the lateral position, and demonstrated dose\u2010dependent analgesia in the foot 1 h later. Epidural clonidine also caused dose\u2010dependent analgesia. The combination of neostigmine and clonidine resulted in an additive enhancement for analgesia, but no enhancement of each drug's side effects, and a reduction in clonidine\u2010induced hypotension. Neostigmine injected into subjects in the lateral position diminished clonidine\u2010induced reductions in blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine. Conclusion These results support enhancement of alpha2 \u2010adrenergic analgesia by intrathecal neostigmine, but do not demonstrate synergy, as observed in animals. Lack of enhancement of side effects suggests this combination may be clinically useful.", "outbound_citations": ["7574056", "7605017", "7762841", "7856901", "7856900", "7856891", "7965774", "7932182", "7639365", "7605758", "7508575", "8363078", "8101218", "8098758", "8439023", "8439026", "1355638", "2262895", "2611655", "2924131", "2563622", "3841316"], "inbound_citations": ["35728381", "35482967", "34056133", "31791560", "30393754", "29739535", "28920043", "26119258", "26273315"], "label": "0"}

Their relative efficacy is not well understood. Methods The methods employed involved the systematic search (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, bibliographies, without language restriction, up to June 2000) for full reports of randomized comparisons of any intervention which is thought to be anti-pruritic (active) compared with placebo or no treatment (control) in surgical (including labour) patients receiving opioids. The number of patients who had no pruritus were analysed using relative risk and number-needed-to-treat with 95% confidence interval. Results Twenty-two trials (1477 patients) were analysed. Two trials (66 patients), both with low-dose propofol, were on treatment of established pruritus; propofol had no anti-pruritic effect compared with Intralipid. In prophylaxis trials, the average incidence of pruritus with control was 59% (range, 10% to 100%). Most mu-receptor antagonists were efficacious: intravenous naloxone 0.25\u20132.4 \u00b5g kg\u22121 h\u22121, relative risk 2.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.54), number-needed-to-treat to prevent pruritus compared with control 3.5; oral naltrexone 9 mg, relative risk 2.80 (1.35\u20135.80), number-needed-to-treat 1.7; naltrexone 6 mg was less effective and 3 mg did not work; different intravenous and epidural nalbuphine regimens, relative risk 1.71 (1.12\u20132.62), number-needed-to-treat 4.2. Intravenous nalmefene 0.5 or 1 mg was not anti-pruritic. Intravenous (but not epidural) droperidol 2.5 mg was efficacious, relative risk, 1.71 (1.28\u20132.29), number-needed-to-treat 4.9. There was a lack of evidence for any anti-pruritic efficacy with prophylactic propofol, epidural or intrathecal epinephrine, epidural clonidine, epidural prednisone, intravenous ondansetron, or intramuscular hydroxyzine.

While risperidone is not usually known to induce dysphoria or depression in patients treated for other psychiatric disorders, previous short-term 4- to 12-week trials of risperidone for Tourette's disorder have reported a 2.6% to 30.8% incidence of depression.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA retrospective study was carried out in 58 adult and adolescent patients with Tourette's disorder (Tourette Syndrome Classification Study Group diagnosis) who received risperidone between Jan. 1, 1993, and Dec. 31, 2000, at the Allan Memorial Institute, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Charts of all patients were examined for evidence of, and risk factors for, DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysphoria.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventeen (29.3%) of 58 patients developed MDD, including 1 patient who later committed suicide and 13 patients (22.4%) who became dysphoric while taking risperidone. Nine of the 17 patients who developed MDD were relapses, i.e., patients with a history of depression prior to taking risperidone, while the remainder were new cases, i.e., patients with no previous history of depression. A positive personal history of MDD was the only factor to significantly (p <.001) predict the development of depression while taking risperidone. Seventy percent of those who developed MDD or dysphoria and discontinued risperidone did so specifically as a result of this adverse event.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMDD and dysphoria commonly occurred in this cohort of adult and adolescent Tourette's disorder patients treated with risperidone, particularly in patients with a previous history of depression.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the differences in the rates of dropout from clinical trials and response between these 2 antipsychotics. METHODS: Literature search was based on MEDLINE (1966\u2013May 2002). Analysis 1 included 4 randomized studies (838 patients), analysis 2 included 2 randomized studies (n = 716), and analysis 3 assessed 5 clinical studies for olanzapine (n = 928) and 3 for risperidone (n = 290). Odds ratios were estimated by the fixed-effect model. RESULTS: The risk of treatment discontinuation (analysis 1) was significantly greater for risperidone than for olanzapine (42% vs. 33%, respectively). The response rates were identical for the 2 drugs (analysis 2). A slightly better pattern of maintenance of response was found for olanzapine (analysis 3).

Children in the clonidine group exhibited more intense anxiety on separation and during induction of anesthesia via a mask as measured by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scores. They also had significantly lower mean intraoperative arterial blood pressures, shorter surgery, anesthesia, and emergence times, and a decreased need for supplemental oxygen during recovery compared with the midazolam group. However, the clonidine group had larger postoperative opioid requirements, maximum excitement and pain scores based on the Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario scale in the Phase 1 postanesthetic care unit. There were no differences between the two groups in the times to discharge readiness, postoperative emesis, unanticipated hospital admission rates, postdischarge maximum pain scores, and 24 h analgesic requirements. The percentage of parents who were completely satisfied with the child\u2019s preoperative experience was significantly higher in the midazolam group. There were no differences in parental satisfaction with the recovery period. We conclude that under the conditions of this study, oral midazolam is superior to oral clonidine as a preanesthetic medication in this patient population.

All trials had an inactive control; there were no direct comparisons. &bgr;-blockers decreased ischemic episodes during surgery (7.6% versus 20.2% with placebo; OR 0.32 [95% CI, 0.17\u20130.58]; NNT 8) and after surgery (15.2% versus 27.9% with control; OR 0.46 [95% CI, 0.26\u20130.81]; NNT 8). &agr;2-agonists decreased ischemia during surgery only (19.4% versus 32.8%; OR 0.47 [95% CI, 0.33\u20130.68]; NNT 7). &bgr;-blockers reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (0.9% versus 5.2%; OR 0.19 [95% CI, 0.08\u20130.48]; NNT 23) but only when 2 trials with high-risk patients were included. The effect of &agr;2-agonists on myocardial infarction was not significant (6.1% versus 7.3%; OR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62\u20131.14]). &bgr;-blockers significantly decreased the risk of cardiac death from 3.9% to 0.8% (OR 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09\u20130.73], NNT 32). &agr;2-agonists significantly decreased the risk of cardiac death from 2.3% to 1.1% (OR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.28\u20130.91], NNT 83). For calcium channel blockers and nitroglycerin, evidence of any benefit was lacking. The most common adverse effect was bradycardia, which occurred in 24.5% of patients receiving a &bgr; adrenergic blocker versus 9.1% of controls (OR 3.76 [95% CI, 2.45\u20135.77], NNH 6).", "outbound_citations": ["11823097", "11903032", "11889023", "11818763", "11308400", "11465968", "11759647", "11004033", "10825304", "10758454", "10588963", "10519497", "10477528", "10071990", "10598610", "10086546", "9675382", "9422300", "9327317", "9312920", "9054253", "8929262", "8873539", "8704533", "8721797", "7879930", "7978438", "8466005", "1643675", "1595849", "1932647", "1817622", "2247116", "1968784", "3207540", "2895596", "3408038", "3300460", "3605732", "3813089", "3104512", "3511930", "2858114", "2865145", "904659", "4147153"], "inbound_citations": ["34421096", "34430217", "32665472", "31998026", "32064194", "31544597", "30624290", "30322462", "29556560", "29533470", "28625607", "28632509", "28077529", "27716690", "27543518", "27488764", "27396805", "27150001", "26436291", "26379818", "25541033"], "label": "0"}

Adult patients of either sex diagnosed as having either open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled in the study. Patients using only 0.5% timolol maleate twice daily for at least 4 weeks and who had 8 AM IOPs of at least 22 mm Hg and no greater than 30 mm Hg 12 hours after dosing were eligible for the study. After 8 AM baseline IOPs were obtained while patients were taking timolol only, they were then randomized to receive either 0.5% or 1.0% apraclonidine twice daily in addition to their timolol. Intraocular pressures were measured at 8 AM (before morning dosing) and at 11 AM (3 hours after dosing) on days 14 and 90 and at 8 AM only on day 45.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth concentrations of apraclonidine produced significant IOP reductions from baseline at all visits (P < .001). At 8 AM, after the nighttime dose, the additional mean IOP reduction from the timolol baseline ranged from 2.5 to 3.3 mm Hg (10.3% to 13.6% reduction, respectively). At 11 AM, 3 hours after the morning dose, the additional IOP reduction from the timolol baseline ranged from 4.7 to 5.2 mm Hg (20.0% to 21.7%, respectively). No difference in IOP reduction was observed between the 0.5% and 1.0% apraclonidine concentrations and no loss of IOP efficacy was observed for either concentration for the duration of the study. Sensitivity to 0.5% and 1.0% apraclonidine was observed in nine (13.8%) and 13 (20.3%) patients, respectively. Overall, therapy was discontinued owing to ocular or nonocular side effects with 0.5% and 1.0% apraclonidine in 14 (21.5%) and 16 (25%) patients, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe believe that 0.5% apraclonidine is equally effective as 1.0% apraclonidine when used twice daily as the first adjunctive drug to timolol.

A total of 180 patients were included in the study; however, 21 patients were excluded from the study after assignment.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients who developed actual alcohol withdrawal syndrome were randomized to one of the following treatment regimens: flunitrazepam/clonidine (n=54); chlormethiazole/haloperidol (n=50); or flunitrazepam/haloperidol (n=55). The need for administration of medication was determined, using a validated measure of the severity of alcohol withdrawal (Revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale).\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nThe duration of mechanical ventilation and major intercurrent complications, such as pneumonia, sepsis, cardiac disorders, bleeding disorders, and death, were documented. Patients did not differ significantly between groups regarding age, Revised Trauma and Injury Severity Score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score on admission. In all except four patients in the flunitrazepam/clonidine group, who continued to hallucinate, the Revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale decreased to <20 after initiation of therapy. ICU stay did not significantly differ between groups (p=.1669). However, mechanical ventilation was significantly prolonged in the chlormethiazole/haloperidol group (p=.0315) due to an increased frequency of pneumonia (p=.0414). Cardiac complications were significantly (p=.0047) increased in the flunitrazepam/clonidine group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere was some advantage in the flunitrazepam/clonidine regimen with respect to pneumonia and the necessity for mechanical ventilation. However, four (7%) patients had to be excluded from the study due to ongoing hallucinations during therapy. Also, cardiac complications were increased in this group. Thus, flunitrazepam/haloperidol should be preferred in patients with cardiac or pulmonary risk.

Withdrawal intensity is similar to, or marginally greater with alpha2-adrenergic agonists, but signs and symptoms of withdrawal occur and resolve earlier in treatment. Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone. The likelihood of completing withdrawal is similar, or slightly less, with clonidine or lofexidine. Clonidine is associated with more adverse effects than reducing doses of methadone. Three studies compared the alpha2-adrenergic agonists, clonidine and lofexidine. Lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nParticipants stay in treatment longer with methadone regimes, which may provide greater opportunity for psychosocial intervention. Methadone regimes may be preferable for withdrawal in outpatient settings where the risk of relapse to heroin use is high. The use of methadone may also facilitate transfer to maintenance treatment should completion of withdrawal become unlikely. For those who are well prepared for withdrawal and seeking earlier resolution of withdrawal symptoms, alpha2-adrenergic agonist treatment may be preferred. Clonidine and lofexidine appear equally effective for inpatient settings, but the lower incidence of hypotension makes lofexidine more suited to use in outpatient settings.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35607713", "33281447", "30405254", "28365208"], "label": "0"}

This literature review was undertaken to assess the cost effectiveness of CR dosage forms using such measures as purchase costs, total treatment costs, and economic value of improved therapeutic outcomes compared with those with non-CR dosage forms. Three therapeutic areas were examined: cardiovascular therapy, pain management and estrogen replacement therapy. In cardiovascular therapy, prescription costs of sustained release (SR) verapamil were significantly higher than for conventional release verapamil. However, these were more than offset by lower physician, hospital and laboratory expenditures for the SR group, in whom compliance was superior. Similarly, patients receiving SR diltiazem had better prescription refill compliance than those using a conventional formulation of the drug, as well as significantly lower aggregate healthcare costs during a 1-year study period. These lower costs with both SR verapamil and diltiazem may relate to better compliance. CR nifedipine has lower daily acquisition costs than the conventional form, simplifies the dosage regimen to once daily, extends the indications of the drug to hypertension as well as angina, and reduces vasodilatory adverse effects by reducing peak plasma drug concentrations and the postdose rate of increase in concentration. Compared with oral clonidine given twice daily, transdermal clonidine, given once weekly, had higher purchase costs, but was associated with improved compliance, reduced adverse effects (due to control of plasma concentrations), and lower nondrug health costs, such as physician, hospital and laboratory costs. Lower costs were also found for once daily oral formulations of various antihypertensives, suggesting that the economics of both types of CR dosage forms related to compliance. CR metoprolol 50 or 100mg and conventional release atenolol 50mg, each given once daily, provided effective beta1-adrenoceptor blockade. The conventional formulation caused deterioration in the sense of well-being that was temporally associated with sharp peaking of its plasma concentrations. Such peaking did not occur with either dose of CR metoprolol, nor did any deterioration in the sense of well-being. Transdermal nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate), compared with long-acting oral nitrates, improved quality of life (QOL) {despite a higher incidence of some adverse effects, such as headache, dizziness and skin irritation}. Furthermore, in some studies, this formulation reduced angina attacks, sublingual nitroglycerin use, and hospitalisation or emergency room use. Cost comparisons between transdermal products favoured those that have superior adhesion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "outbound_citations": ["23890246", "10147041", "10147021", "8490585", "1611225", "658114", "2373131", "7911403", "8105172", "8263896", "8269458", "8221822", "8456888", "1286494", "1519636", "1534476", "1350596", "1317387", "1558342", "1349744", "1517633", "1517634", "1517630", "1517636", "1517635", "1508062", "1508061", "1730176", "1928808", "1867225", "2050834", "2059396", "1898652", "1907801", "1909749", "1712708", "2000864", "2078319", "2102668", "1975045", "1973969", "2327844", "2191779", "2782273", "2687646", "2670019", "2755859", "2751849", "2720578", "2726274", "2644830", "2626976", "2663327", "3144919", "2972209", "2898636", "3354408", "3332574", "3657888", "3310722", "3585450", "3578453", "3802702", "2945414", "3520318", "3012339", "3941238", "4028622", "2992279", "4000199", "6383611", "10267407", "6619747", "6310460", "6824255", "6822131", "7032269", "7042837", "7312007", "7307423", "7370682", "949062", "1245090", "1907802", "218151", "1575123", "1477447", "2078320", "3938682", "3152619", "10146926", "90802", "1617909", "2078318", "3117368", "2720581", "2982302"], "inbound_citations": ["35630124", "35160628", "33353435", "33017199", "32305364", "32057169", "32027446", "31664794", "30217519", "29779862", "28867296", "27329201", "26396543", "26333528"], "label": "0"}

Fifty subjects met the DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, participated in a 10-week, double-blind comparison of haloperidol and clozapine and a 1-year, open-label clozapine trial, and had available serum glucose and lipid levels. Weight and glucose, and lipid laboratory values were measured at the baseline and throughout the double-blind and year-long study. There were significant increases in serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and glucose levels during the course of clozapine treatment. There were no significant changes in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Propranolol and atenolol had additive effects on changes in the total cholesterol and triglycerides, with propranolol having the most pronounced effects.

Concurrent beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist treatment may have an additive effect on serum lipids, and clozapine-associated weight gain also plays a modest role in triglyceride increases.", "outbound_citations": ["12502614", "11735847", "10831479", "10584769", "10586536", "10450273", "10202605", "10027480", "10079027", "9798083", "9671341", "9619146", "9546324", "9108812", "8941166", "7872581", "8749886", "8039850", "1882209", "2188492", "2686456", "3046553", "2867037"], "inbound_citations": ["33716966", "28266722", "28883496"], "label": "0"}

A question with major clinical implications is whether the higher doses commonly used in the United States lead to a better outcome or a different profile of side effects. Outcome as a function of serum concentration will be examined. Results confirm a lower dose, lower clozapine blood level, and a lesser degree of side effects in the Austrian cohort when compared to the American sample.

A double-blind, crossover design was used to compare the effects of methylphenidate versus placebo on an electroencephalogram, AED levels, and the CPT. On the 2 days of testing, the child received AEDs and a capsule containing either placebo or methylphenidate. None of the 25 children of this sample who were seizure free had attacks while taking methylphenidate. Of the 5 children with seizures, 3 had an increase in attacks, whereas the other 2 showed no change or a reduction. There were no significant changes in AED levels or electroencephalographic findings. Methylphenidate benefited 70% of children according to parental report; methylphenidate also enhanced performance on the CPT. Side effects of methylphenidate were mild and transient.

The study consisted of a 1-week placebo phase followed by 8 weeks of active treatment with bupropion SR 150 mg/d (150 mg QD, n = 121) or 300 mg/d (150 mg BID, n = 120) or placebo (n = 121).

Safety was monitored by regular assessment of vital signs and adverse events as well as by pretreatment and posttreatment physical and clinical laboratory examinations. By day 56, both bupropion SR treatments were more effective in relieving the symptoms of depression than was placebo. Compared with those receiving placebo, patients in the bupropion SR 150- and 300-mg/d groups had significantly reduced symptoms by treatment day 56, as measured on the 17-item HAM-D, CGI-S, and CGI-I scales (P < 0.05).

Methods Eighty eyes were randomly assigned to four groups of 20 eyes. In a double-masked design, the groups were treated with placebo (group I), 0.50% timolol maleate (group 2), 1% apraclonidine (group 3), 0.25% apraclonidine (group 4) one hour before and five minutes after Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. IOP was measured by applanation tonometry 1 hour before (baseline IOP) and 1,3, 24 hours after capsulotomy. Results The average baseline IOP increased respectively 3.90 \u00b1 5.35, 5.95 \u00b1 5.32, 1.15 \u00b1 3.20 mmHg in the first group 1, 3 and 24 hours post-treatment. There were significant differences between baseline IOP and 1 and 3 hours but not at 24 hours (p=0.004, p=0.001, p=0.13). IOP increased 0.40 \u00b1 4.08, 0.75 \u00b1 5.33, 0.80 \u00b1 6.03 mmHg in the second group at the same times. The differences between the average baseline IOP and the 1, 3 and 24h measurement were not significant (p=0.83, p=0.65, p=0.93). In the third group, IOP decreased 3.70 \u00b1 2.40, 3.30 \u00b1 2.47, 2.65 \u00b1 1.56 mmHg at the measurement times, with significant differences between the average baseline IOP and the 1, 3 and 24 hour measurements (p=0.001, p=0.0001, p=0.01). In the fourth group IOP increased 0.35 \u00b1 3.32 mmHg at 1 hour, but decreased 1.25 \u00b1 3.41, 0.90 \u00b1 2.07 mmHg at 3 and 24 hours. The differences were not significant (p=0.94, p=0.16, p=0.08). When the 0.25% and 1% apraclonidine groups were compared, there were significant differences between the average IOP at 1 hour in both groups but not at 3 and 24 hours (p=0.01, p=0.17, p=0.21). Similarly, there were no significant differences between the average IOP at the same times when the 0.25% apraclonidine group was compared with the timolol group (p=0.30, p=0.08, p=0.16). Some systemic and local side effects were seen in the timolol and 1% apraclonidine groups, but none with 0.25% apraclonidine. Conclusions It was concluded that 0.25% apraclonidine is effective in preventing the early elevation of IOP after Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy and may offer an alternative to 0.50% timolol maleate and 1% apraclonidine.", "outbound_citations": ["7722914", "7962666", "8101046", "1609572", "1683697", "1952331", "2012551", "2204271", "2672819", "2778694", "3062536", "3041944", "3390053", "3369999", "3307716", "3566598", "3839390", "3991124", "3991123", "3982799", "6660258", "7440377"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

The primary purpose of this study was to compare EPS profiles in Japanese schizophrenic patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, or a typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, as measured by the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). The DIEPSS, which consists of eight individual parameters and one global assessment (overall severity), was used to evaluate 182 patients enrolled in this 8-week study. The primary safety analysis was maximum change (that could be either a decrease or increase) from baseline in DIEPSS total score. Secondary analyses included change from baseline to maximum in DIEPSS total score, change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF) in DIEPSS total score, and the rank sum of the maximum change (that could be either a decrease or increase) from baseline in the DIEPSS individual items. Incidence of treatment-emergent EPS adverse events using the DIEPSS scale was also analyzed. The olanzapine group showed statistically significant superiority to the haloperidol group on the primary analysis (p<0.001). Secondary analyses also demonstrated olanzapine's superiority in DIEPSS total, parkinsonism, akathisia and overall severity scores (all p< or =0.014). Categorical analysis of treatment-emergent akathisia and parkinsonism syndromes at endpoint showed improvement in the olanzapine group but worsening in the haloperidol group.

We performed an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), assessments of on and off time at baseline and at 9 weeks after starting the medication. Sixteen patients on olanzapine (mean dose, 4.6 mg/night) and 11 on placebo completed the study. Compared with placebo, performance on the UPDRS item 2 (thought disorder), and a structured interview for hallucinations, both tended to improve on drug but neither reached statistical significance. A neuropsychological test battery did not show any significant differences. Total on UPDRS motor scores (P < 0.05) and timed tapping (P < 0.01) worsened while on drug compared to placebo. Bradykinesia (P < 0.01) and gait (P < 0.001) items on the UPDRS largely accounted for this deterioration. After completion of the study, 8 of 16 patients randomly assigned to drug continued olanzapine at a mean dose of 2.4 mg/day. However, at the last recorded visit only 5 of 24 (20.8%) of all patients exposed to drug (including those originally randomly assigned to placebo) remained on olanzapine. In patients with PD, low\u2010dose olanzapine did not significantly improve hallucinations but did worsen motor function. \u00a9 2002 Movement Disorder Society", "outbound_citations": ["11248593", "11229973", "11548736", "10993997", "10993998", "11020132", "10752567", "10584679", "10440017", "10376627", "10328255", "10399867", "10442253", "10335670", "9789708", "9789709", "9566437", "9566425", "8970453", "8857751", "8600200", "7723953"], "inbound_citations": ["36720473", "36282782", "35010624", "33183105", "32662076", "32480308", "32299774", "32973999", "31920635", "31392434", "31551655", "31241368", "30404581", "31727232", "30588905", "29563893", "29494265", "29374325", "29047301", "29098976", "29104810", "28385039", "28106066", "28802934", "27830568", "27800022", "27258073", "27629356", "27504054", "27312429", "27056066", "27048443", "26377851", "26646536", "26788353", "26239690", "26092916", "27703720", "25970275"], "label": "0"}

Theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios were also calculated. Subjects were placed on a 6-month trial of a stimulant and a second EEG was recorded at the end of the trial. The ADHD group had significantly greater absolute delta and theta, less posterior absolute beta, more relative theta, and less relative alpha than the control group, which is typical of EEG studies of children with ADHD.

Recently, thioridazine has been subjected to a restricted indications notice and sertindole had its license withdrawn because of concerns about their potential cardiotoxicity. In the development of new atypical agents, heart-rate corrected QT effects are evaluated but it is unclear how predictive these are of clinically significant cardiotoxicity or sudden death. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a potential index of cardiotoxicity which has been found to be decreased following antidepressants and clozapine. We studied acute HRV changes following antipsychotic agents. Sixteen healthy male volunteers received risperidone (4 mg), olanzapine (10 mg), thioridazine (50 mg) or placebo in a randomized cross-over design. Subjective effects and psychomotor function were assayed at 2 h and both linear (summary statistics) and non-linear (scatterplot) measures of HRV were evaluated by continuous electrocardiogram recording over 10 h. Differential effects of single doses of the three antipsychotic drugs on HRV were found, and these were independent of their sedative effects. Olanzapine increased, and thioridazine decreased HRV, while risperidone had no effect. HRV is sensitive to the acute effects of antipsychotics. It may prove to be a reliable index of their potential for cardiotoxicity. Further studies in both healthy volunteers and patients on antipsychotic medication will be valuable.", "outbound_citations": ["11483480", "11199953", "10744090", "10504819", "10190650", "9769304", "9743509", "9701718", "9533973", "9444900", "9436823", "9264491", "9052341", "8890814", "8795444", "8712033", "8690829", "8610612", "8657595", "8598068", "7572650", "7477605", "8656134", "7760442", "8150790", "7906527", "8319331", "1681681", "22156505", "2893634", "3812275", "7010157", "1106446", "5953158", "5834204", "14176059"], "inbound_citations": ["35205076", "31053339", "30972967", "30945093", "30578793", "28244034", "27733301", "28203208", "26779966", "26574175", "25639523"], "label": "0"}

Modafinil, 200 and 400 mg, also reduced the combined number of daytime sleep episodes and periods of severe sleepiness noted in sleep logs. The likelihood of falling asleep as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was equally reduced by both modafinil dose levels. There were no effects on nocturnal sleep initiation, maintenance, or architecture, nor were there any effects on sleep apnea or periodic leg movements. Neither dose interfered with the patients' ability to nap voluntarily during the day nor with their quantity or quality of nocturnal sleep. Modafinil produced no changes in blood pressure or heart rate in either normotensive or hypertensive patients. The only significant adverse effects were seen at the 400-mg dose, which was associated with more nausea and more nervousness than either placebo or the 200-mg dose.

The aim of this study was to assess, by interim analyses, the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic agent olanzapine in combination with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant agent fluoxetine.\n\n\nMETHOD\nWe enrolled 27 patients (17 women [63.0%] and 10 men [37.0%]; mean +/- SD age: 41.2 +/- 14.7 years) with DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder with psychotic features into an open trial of olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/day, plus fluoxetine, 20 to 80 mg/day. Patients were assessed at each visit with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and both the psychotic and mood modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Patient Edition. We are reporting the results of the first 6 weeks of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-two (81.5%) of the 27 enrolled patients completed the 6-week open trial, and 5 (18.5%) dropped out, with only 2 (7.4%) dropping out due to side effects. Of the 27 patients, 74.1% (N = 20) met criteria for melancholic features, 14.8% (N = 4) had delusions alone, 18.5% (N = 5) had hallucinations alone, and 66.7% (N = 18) reported both delusions and hallucinations. In addition, the overall rates of response for the intent-to-treat group were as follows: depression response rate, 66.7% (N = 18); psychosis response rate, 59.3% (N = 16); psychotic depression response rate, 55.6% (N = 15); and psychotic depression remission rate, 40.7% (N = 11).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine appears to be a promising, safe, and effective treatment for psychotic depression. Double-blind studies are needed to confirm this impression.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["27123919", "26056947"], "label": "0"}

At adolescent (age 15) and adult follow-up, probands were interviewed about their use of various substances and duration of stimulant treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuration of stimulant treatment was not significantly associated with frequency of any form of drug use by young adulthood. Stimulant-treated children had no greater risk of ever trying drugs by adolescence or any significantly greater frequency of drug use by young adulthood. Stimulant treatment in high school also did not influence drug use in adulthood except for greater use of cocaine. This difference was no longer significant after controlling for severity of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Stimulant treatment in either childhood or high school was not associated with any greater risk for any formal Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised drug dependence or abuse disorders by adulthood.

The EEG slowing correlated with observed sleepiness, although this factor was not sufficient to explain the severity of high-dose effects.", "outbound_citations": ["7786955", "22298695", "7858072", "7991106", "7522149", "7961562", "7950347", "8071267", "8317593", "8354736", "8415896", "1480676", "1517198", "7846212", "1728165", "1422175", "2221158", "2706793", "3458402", "383098", "412427"], "inbound_citations": ["36271340", "35890117", "34564289", "34461790", "33866283", "33000411", "32987640", "30993670", "30855515", "30308569", "30947495", "30247179", "29325180", "28613395", "27776383", "26617071", "26118746", "25213349"], "label": "0"}

We studied 120 patients undergoing elective abdominal or orthopedic surgery under standardized general anesthesia. After surgery, patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups (each group n = 30) using a double-blinded protocol: Group A received 0.2 mg/kg urapidil; Group B, 3 microg/kg clonidine; Group C, 0.4 mg/kg meperidine; and Group D, saline 0.9% as placebo. Postanesthetic shivering was scored by using a five-point scale. Clonidine and meperidine significantly reduced the incidence and the severity of shivering in comparison with placebo, whereas there were no significant differences between the urapidil and placebo groups. Both clonidine and meperidine caused a significantly prolonged emergence time (13.4 +/- 5.8 and 13. 3 +/- 5.0 min, respectively) compared with placebo (10.4 +/- 5.3 min) and urapidil (11.4 +/- 2.9 min). We confirmed that both clonidine and meperidine are effective in preventing postanesthetic shivering, whereas urapidil, in our setting and dosage, was not effective. Patients who received clonidine or meperidine had a prolonged emergence time.

METHODS ONH and peripapillary retinal blood flow of 17 healthy subjects were measured by SLDF before and 1 hour and 3 hours after unilateral administration of 0.5% apraclonidine. The fellow eyes were treated with balanced salt solution and the examiners were masked as to which eye was treated with apraclonidine. On each occasion, three scans were obtained and haemodynamic variables (volume, flow, and velocity) were analysed at eight locations, four in the neural rim and four in the peripapillary retina, avoiding ophthalmoscopically visible vessels. The statistical significance of changes from the baseline value of variables and the differences in the measured quantities between apraclonidine treated eyes and fellow eyes at each time point were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS The intraocular pressure was reduced significantly in apraclonidine treated eyes by 15.0% (p=0.001) at 1 hour and 30.0% (p=0.000) at 3 hours after administration. In the volume, flow, or velocity of ONH and peripapillary retinal blood flow, there were no significant changes from the baseline values at 1 hour and 3 hours after apraclonidine administration in either apraclonidine treated eyes (p >0.4) or fellow eyes (p >0.2). Also, no significant differences were found in the measured quantities between apraclonidine treated eyes and fellow eyes at each time point (p >0.1).

It has a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects but may cause agranulocytosis. There have been no long-term assessments of its effect on symptoms, social functioning, and the use and cost of health care.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, one-year, double-blind comparative study of clozapine (in 205 patients) and haloperidol (in 218 patients) at 15 Veterans Affairs medical centers. All participants had refractory schizophrenia and had been hospitalized for the disease for 30 to 364 days in the previous year. All patients received case-management and social-rehabilitation services, as clinically indicated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the clozapine group, 117 patients (57 percent) continued their assigned treatment for the entire year, as compared with 61 (28 percent) of the patients in the haloperidol group (P<0.001). As judged according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale of Schizophrenia, patients in the clozapine group had 5.4 percent lower symptom levels than those in the haloperidol group at all follow-up evaluations (mean score, 79.1 vs. 83.6; P=0.02). The differences on a quality-of-life scale were not significant in the intention-to-treat analysis, but they were significant among patients who did not cross over to the other treatment (P=0.003). Over a one-year period, patients assigned to clozapine had fewer mean days of hospitalization for psychiatric reasons than patients assigned to haloperidol (143.8 vs. 168.1 days, P=0.03) and used more outpatient services (133.6 vs. 97.9 units of service, P=0.03). The total per capita costs to society were high -- $58,151 in the clozapine group and $60,885 in the haloperidol group (P=0.41). The per capita costs of antipsychotic drugs were $3,199 in the clozapine group and $367 in the haloperidol group (P<0.001). Patients assigned to clozapine had less tardive dyskinesia and fewer extrapyramidal side effects. Agranulocytosis developed in three patients in the clozapine group; all recovered fully.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor patients with refractory schizophrenia and high levels of hospital use, clozapine was somewhat more effective than haloperidol and had fewer side effects and similar overall costs.", "outbound_citations": ["8993092", "7755110", "7755109", "8749886", "7770734", "7977880", "7961564", "8188199", "8164606", "8267129", "8132186", "8105705", "8357299", "8515788", "8332569", "8100642", "1375019", "2401480", "2611602", "2574607", "3046553", "3616518", "6474101", "4917967"], "inbound_citations": ["34619819", "34496316", "34188983", "33513093", "32928617", "32109805", "31977065", "31766049", "31857930", "31439658", "31428862", "31347436", "30864459", "30791698", "31089103", "30195742", "30257080", "30218445", "30192088", "30155842", "30093869", "29413518", "29284810", "28762843", "28655284", "28333365", "28240154", "28240152", "27650195", "27388573", "27301766", "27453458", "26756090", "27091214", "26926002", "26842482", "26941635"], "label": "0"}

Given the importance of nicotine craving and withdrawal in the smoking cessation process, the current study examined the effects of bupropion on these parameters during smoking abstinence. During a 2-day Baseline phase with ad lib smoking, 91 non-depressed smokers (who were not trying to quit permanently) were administered measures of nicotine craving, withdrawal symptoms, and timed measures of cognitive performance five times daily. Participants were then assigned randomly to a 14-day treatment regimen with bupropion 300 mg/day, bupropion 150 mg/day, or placebo. Thereafter, the above measures were re-administered during 3 days of abstinence on a closed research ward. Relative to placebo, 300 mg bupropion significantly reduced abstinence-associated increases in rated depression, difficulty concentrating, and irritability, and attenuated a decrease in positive affect. The results also suggested that bupropion might have a positive effect on performance measures during the withdrawal period. No effects were observed on craving, anxiety, restlessness, or hunger. The lack of findings on craving measures may be explained by a floor effect; except on the first day of abstinence, neither drug nor placebo groups showed much craving elevation during abstinence. Study results indicate that bupropion ameliorates some nicotine withdrawal symptoms.", "outbound_citations": ["10053177", "9103722", "9337378", "8871421", "7568442", "7556033", "8201739", "7904003", "8179658", "8110249", "8465868", "7681369", "2057036", "2178852", "2343783", "2752917", "2563045", "6532150"], "inbound_citations": ["37216808", "36904096", "36001439", "33888006", "33039460", "32684065", "32319681", "32220607", "31058286", "30920255", "30774343", "29220524", "29069464", "30464795", "29609056", "28942430", "28489501", "28240934", "28028605", "27213949", "27357261", "27083449", "26054790", "26101069", "25530426", "25662704"], "label": "0"}

The present study investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole and haloperidol compared with placebo.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA 4-week, double-blind, randomized study, conducted at 36 U.S. centers between July 1997 and June 1998, compared aripiprazole (15 mg/day, 30 mg/day) to placebo, with haloperidol (10 mg/day) as an active control. Fixed doses of each agent were administered from day 1 throughout the study. A total of 414 patients with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized. Efficacy measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, PANSS positive, PANSS negative, PANSS-derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) core, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Severity of Illness, and mean CGI-Improvement scores. Safety and tolerability evaluations included extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), weight gain, serum prolactin level, and QTc interval.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth doses of aripiprazole and haloperidol, 10 mg, produced statistically significant (p < or = .05) improvements from baseline in PANSS total, PANSS positive, PANSS-derived BPRS core, and CGI-Severity scores and significantly lower CGI-Improvement scores at endpoint, compared with placebo. Aripiprazole, 15 mg, and haloperidol, 10 mg, significantly improved PANSS negative score compared with placebo. Both aripiprazole doses and haloperidol separated from placebo for PANSS total scores at week 2. Unlike haloperidol, aripiprazole was not associated with significant EPS or prolactin elevation at endpoint compared with placebo. There were no statistically significant differences in mean changes in body weight across the treatment groups versus placebo, and no patients receiving aripiprazole experienced clinically significant increases in QTc interval.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAripiprazole, effective against positive and negative symptoms, is a safe and well-tolerated potential treatment for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.", "outbound_citations": ["12065741", "11780870", "11775041", "11346194", "11346192", "11082417", "11217540", "10719161", "10596903", "10340682", "10190228", "9821662", "9442338", "9564205", "8966556", "8613910", "7616416", "7916523", "7862264", "2252325", "2197154", "2574607", "2708556", "3075131", "3041384", "3249784", "3616518", "3854", "5477307", "4917967"], "inbound_citations": ["36869320", "36979900", "36810742", "35987254", "35904494", "35840763", "35641112", "35131396", "35923249", "34992373", "34456770", "34374418", "34201784", "33960741", "33692392", "33857042", "33417374", "33136923", "32891516", "32841554", "31299229", "32721452", "32621071", "32345400", "32246399", "31933402", "32345400", "31695618", "31250403", "31158853", "31303314", "31223470", "30566415", "30306873", "29878915", "29858840", "29506749", "30210778", "29686254", "29862236", "29637739", "29581800", "29179595", "29308601", "29464048", "28088913", "28412910", "28625204", "28368577", "28342578", "28101322", "28740149", "27909826", "27977041", "27783545", "26861810", "27553839", "27485429", "27372312", "26963842", "27157799", "26679983", "26927951", "26912127", "26864352", "26414966", "26933364", "26426442", "26477545", "26325094", "26346901", "26467415", "26289486", "25647451", "25792838", "25751513", "25672664"], "label": "0"}

The goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the incidence of both hypotension and bradycardia during integrated epidural/general anaesthesia in a multicentric, observational study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe incidence of clinical hypotension (systolic arterial blood pressure decrease by 30% or more from baseline), and bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats/min) and other side effects have been evaluated in 1200 consecutive patients receiving integrated epidural/general anaesthesia. The time from induction of epidural anaesthesia to induction of general anaesthesia was considered as preoperative; while the time after general anaesthesia induction was considered as intraoperative.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPreoperatively hypotension developed in 85 patients (2.8%), and bradycardia in 54 patients (4.5%). Intraoperatively, hypotension was observed in 380 patients (31.6%), and bradycardia in 153 patients (12.7%). Hypotension and bradycardia were not influenced by the type of surgical procedure, the type of maintenance of general anaesthesia (inhalational versus total intravenous general anaesthesia) and the level of epidural block (lumbar versus thoracic); but they were more frequent in patients with ASA physical status II and III-IV compared to patients with ASA physical status I (p < 0.05). Prophylactic volume preload decreased the incidence of hypotension from 41.5% to 22.4% (p < 0.0001), while prophylactic atropine before epidural block did not affect the incidence of bradycardia. Patients receiving epidural clonidine showed an increased incidence of intraoperative bradycardia compared to those who did not receive it (p < 0.0001).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nRandomized, controlled studies should be advocated in order to compare the incidence of hypotension and bradycardia during integrated anaesthesia and during epidural block alone.

Patients were switched from risperidone to olanzapine over a 2-week period, then treated with olanzapine for 8 additional weeks. The serum prolactin concentrations were examined every 2 weeks. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Simpson-Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Symptoms (SAS), and questions from the Dickson-Glazer Sexual Functioning Scale were administered to evaluate efficacy, extrapyramidal side effects, and sexual and reproductive functioning at baseline and the endpoint of 10 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSerum prolactin levels decreased significantly (p < .01) following the switch from risperidone to olanzapine. Scores of PANSS, AIMS, and SAS at the endpoint were also significantly decreased (p < .01) compared to those of baseline. Patients experienced improvements in menstrual functioning and perceptions of sexual side effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOlanzapine reversed hyperprolactinemia in risperidone-treated female schizophrenic patients.

We review literature pertaining to key questions related to use of pharmacotherapy in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder. The few double-blind trials with a reasonable sample size are restricted to bipolar I patients and address a modest range of questions mostly related to use of lithium. One rigorous multicenter trial found valproate to have prophylactic benefit. Other studies with valproate alone and in combination suggest efficacy equivalent to lithium and perhaps greater than carbamazepine. Data available for combination treatment are sparse but moderately encouraging. Maintenance treatment with standard antidepressant medications appears destabilizing for some bipolar patients, particularly following a mixed episode. Although some bipolar patients may benefit from combined treatment with a mood stabilizer and a standard antidepressant medication, current knowledge does not allow confident selection of the bipolar patients who might benefit. Clozapine and perhaps other atypical antipsychotics are promising options for maintenance treatment but have not been evaluated in double-blind trials. The numerous other agents used in maintenance treatment are primarily adjuncts to lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine, and information about them is largely anecdotal and uncontrolled. Study design for maintenance trials remains an imperfect art. Conclusions must be drawn cautiously, given the limited generalizability of study designs that accession samples enriched with presumed treatment responders, randomize patients after brief periods of partial remission, abruptly taper prior treatment, make no attempt to distinguish relapse from recurrence, use no formal outcome assessments, or report hospitalization as the only outcome criterion.", "outbound_citations": ["11030483", "10895797", "10529070", "10450271", "10450255", "9864077", "10327902", "9472841", "9433335", "9433333", "9547135", "9326833", "9165384", "9108809", "9089821", "9262937", "8678195", "7625459", "7864263", "7491378", "7881787", "8173817", "7903511", "9384841", "1543034", "1929776", "1774419", "1888958", "2244795", "2113802", "1970815", "2184796", "2109970", "2811970", "2540724", "3151275", "2970498", "3115347", "3093468", "3535976", "3510571", "3861072", "6437366", "6501672", "6789793", "6108577", "7360839", "548247", "347953", "352607", "4580439", "4571148", "4562449", "5580377", "4097626", "4194439", "14080575"], "inbound_citations": ["36724568", "31453901", "28738324", "25984407"], "label": "0"}

However, important findings such as high levels of activating cytokines in the CSF and signs of CNS inflammation have been controversial. The authors conducted a trial of the new selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib, an immunomodulatory drug, in schizophrenic patients to evaluate its therapeutic effects.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIn a prospective, double-blind evaluation, 50 patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were randomly assigned to either risperidone plus celecoxib or risperidone plus placebo. After a washout period, 25 patients received 2-6 mg/day of risperidone plus placebo and 25 received risperidone plus 400 mg/day of celecoxib for 5 weeks. The treatment effect was calculated by analysis of covariance. There were no significant differences between groups in age, sex, duration or severity of disease or psychopathology, or risperidone dose or plasma level.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver 5 weeks, both groups of patients showed significant improvement in scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and on all subscales. However, the celecoxib group showed significantly greater improvement in the total score.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdditional treatment with celecoxib has significant positive effects on the therapeutic action of risperidone with regard to total schizophrenia psychopathology. Moreover, the fact that treatment with an immunomodulatory drug showed beneficial effects on schizophrenia symptoms indicates that immune dysfunction in schizophrenia is not just an epiphenomenon but is related to the pathomechanism of the disorder.

Using confirmatory factor analysis, a six-factor structure was found which includes Hyperactivity-Impulsivity, Perfectionism, Inattention/Cognitive Problems, Social Problems, Oppositionality, and Anxious/Shy factors. The reliability of the scale, as measured by test-retest correlations and internal consistency, is generally satisfactory. Using all of the scale factors to discriminate between attention deficit hyperactivity disordered and normal children, 85 percent of children were correctly classified, supporting the validity of the scale and indicating excellent clinical utility.

The protocol of the study consisted in five periods of growth rate, insulin-like growth factor-1, basal and GHRH-stimulated GH level evaluation: 1) 6-month pretreatment (P1); 2) 6-month placebo administration (PO); 3) after 4 months of therapy (P1); 4) after 4 months of clonidine withdrawal (P2); 5) after 4 months of therapy reinstatement (P3). No difference was observed between P-1 and P0 when all the parameters were considered. During P1 a significant increase of linear growth (p < 0.05 vs P0 and P-1) was observed while standard deviation of height was not modified. At the end of P2, the growth rate and standard deviation of height were similar to those recorded in P0 and P-1. After reinstatement of clonidine therapy a new but less pronounced rise of the growth rate was found (p < 0.05 vs P1, p < 0.01 vs P0 and P-1). GH, insulin-like growth factor-1, GHRH-stimulated GH levels had significantly increased during P1 than P0 and P-1 (p < 0.05), while during P2 they were similar to P0 and P-1. During P3 a new increase of insulin-like growth factor-I baseline and GHRH-stimulated GH levels were observed. However, these were significantly lower than those observed during P1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "outbound_citations": ["2100275", "2855221", "2884368", "2902319", "7195462", "1934527", "2918053", "2514051", "6417632", "6114446", "1184719", "2861413", "8419612", "4393798", "6325138", "2162745", "471580", "1977761", "3095519"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

Outcomes in multiple domains were assessed, and data were analyzed using analysis of variance and Kaplan Meier product limit estimates for time to study cessation. The primary time point for analysis was the last available patient visit using last observation carried forward.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChildren in the OROS and IR MPH groups showed significantly greater reductions in core ADHD symptoms than did children on placebo.

Modafinil coadministration did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of d\u2010 or l\u2010threo\u2010methylphenidate, except for a small decrease in Vd/F of l\u2010threo\u2010methylphenidate. Concomitant methylphenidate may cause a delay in the oral absorption of modafinil, but this delay might not be relevant clinically. Coadministration did not alter the extent of oral absorption and disposition of either agent.

For non-ADHD areas of functioning (for example, social skills, academic performance), combined treatments may offer modest advantages over single-component approaches. Longer-term outcomes past 14 months of intensive MTA treatments (as well as their relative effectiveness with respect to each other) remain unknown, pending further MTA analyses. The MTA treatments by and large consisted of evidence-based \u201cbest practices.\u201d Thus, rather than characterizing these treatments as in-feasible, the substantially superior outcomes of these treatments (versus routine clinical care) across diverse settings should help set the standard for future treatment practices in real-world settings. Despite important study limitations, the MTA study, by virtue of its size, scope, and length; parallel-groups design; explicit use of manualized, evidence-based treatments; and comprehensive range of outcome assessments sets an important benchmark for future trials testing new treatments for childhood ADHD and defines a new standard for optimal outcomes that can be achieved with the best of clinical care.", "outbound_citations": ["10087688", "9334567", "9294377", "9294378", "8951257", "8885584", "8919704", "7665456", "8034812", "8326053", "1593027"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Recent findings Tourette syndrome is a common disorder in children and adolescents, with an established association with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and a number of other psychiatric disorders. Both autoimmune and genetic mechanisms are implicated in the pathophysiology of the syndrome, while neuroimaging studies have identified abnormalities in the composition of the basal ganglia and frontal lobe white matter, as well as alterations in dopaminergic activity. When necessary, treatment of tics can be successful with neuroleptics and &agr;\u20102\u2010adrenergic agonists. The use of stimulants in children with Tourette syndrome and comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder does not appear to worsen tics. Summary As a result of the recent literature, clinicians can feel comfortable treating children with co\u2010morbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Tourette syndrome with stimulant medications. It has also been established that transient tics are very common in children, and for the most part, non\u2010disabling. In those children with persistent tics, behavioural disorders are associated which may impair success in school and psychosocial functioning. Clinicians have a number of therapeutic options, with recent double\u2010blinded randomized trials of clonidine, risperidone, and desipramine showing benefit. Scientists continue to search for the cause of Tourette syndrome.", "outbound_citations": ["16536348", "12497615", "12444819", "12231445", "12153825", "12165586", "12140785", "11925307", "11840360", "12026236", "11886028", "11799340", "11823273", "11942423", "11781410", "12219336", "11254443", "11304830", "10986045", "10521310"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Polypharmacology is a necessary condition for the optimal treatment of many patients with comorbid psychiatric and medical illness. One concern raised by the widespread use of multiple concurrent pharmacotherapies is the potential for drug-drug interactions to adversely affect patient outcome. Accordingly, the biomedical literature was reviewed for reports of drug interactions involving risperidone, and the clinical significance of each report was evaluated. Additionally, the potential for risperidone to participate in drug interactions was evaluated by considering the drug\u2019s pharmacokinetic properties. Controlled studies and case reports indicate that risperidone has a low potential for metabolic drug interactions. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 or induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter risperidone plasma concentrations, but the clinical significance of such interactions seems to be minimal. Adherence to a few guidelines for the design of dosage regimens should limit the effect of drug-drug interactions on patient status and contribute to optimal pharmacotherapy with risperidone.", "outbound_citations": ["10647097", "10453802", "10051063", "10048600", "10357517", "9721824", "9712460", "9632039", "9491064", "9375597", "9269252", "9248870", "9108814", "9746446", "8780436", "8666572", "8768340", "9231305", "8993091", "8823350", "8941167", "7592506", "7592504", "7527327", "7514366", "7915710", "7507814", "7690693", "7683702", "1458763", "1380082", "1524698", "1513919", "1674645", "1687176"], "inbound_citations": ["28347260", "26658079"], "label": "0"}

Aims The development of tardive dyskinesia was evaluated in patients treated with double-blind, randomly assigned olanzapine or haloperidol for up to 2.6 years. Methods Tardive dyskinesia was assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and Research Diagnostic Criteria for Tardive Dyskinesia (RD-TD); it was defined as meeting RD-TD criteria at two consecutive assessments. The risk of tardive dyskinesia, the relative risk, incidence rate, and incidence rate ratio were estimated. Results The relative risk of tardive dyskinesia for the overall follow-up period for haloperidol (n=522) v. olanzapine (n=1192) was 2.66 (95% CI=1.50\u20134.70). Based on data following the initial six weeks of observation (during which patients underwent medication change and AIMS assessments as frequently as every three days), the one-year risk was 0.52% with olanzapine (n=513) and 7.45% with haloperidol (n=114). The relative risk throughout this follow-up period was 11.37 (95% Cl=2.21\u201358.60).

The purpose was to determine whether olanzapine demonstrated a dose-related ability to decrease overall psychopathology with minimal associated extrapyramidal symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The high-dose olanzapine group showed statistically significantly greater improvement in overall psychopathology based on mean change in the CGI Severity score and statistically significantly greater improvement in positive psychotic symptoms based on mean change in both the BPRS positive score and the PANSS positive score compared with the 1.0-mg/day olanzapine group. Analyses indicated that an increasing dose-response curve was observed across the range of all olanzapine dose groups. Acute extrapyramidal syndromes were reported less frequently among all olanzapine groups compared with the haloperidol group. Endpoint mean change on both the Simpson-Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale reflected improvement for all olanzapine treatment groups compared with worsening for the haloperidol group. Olanzapine was associated with weight gain but did not appear to have any clinically meaningful effect on vital signs. Although olanzapine was associated with some increase in prolactin concentrations, increases were transient, occurred less often, and were of lesser magnitude than those observed with haloperidol.", "outbound_citations": ["8822532", "8748045", "7865193", "7514366", "11224268", "8104554", "8515788", "7683702", "1354253", "2574607", "3046553", "507205", "4917967"], "inbound_citations": ["36263635", "36286707", "34122182", "32608144", "32141723", "32093460", "31564881", "31486890", "31303314", "31223470", "29982701", "27977041", "27788310", "26227799", "26364648"], "label": "0"}

This is usually treated with clonidine. To reduce the subjective discomfort, the procedure is conducted under anaesthesia. From the existing literature, one may conclude that despite more than ten years of development there is currently no sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of antagonist-precipitated opioid detoxification under general anaesthesia conducted under modern anaesthesiological management.

There were no significant differences in age, weight, gender, warm and cold ischaemic periods, and original renal disease between treatment groups. Treatment was started intravenously 2 h before the transplantation procedure and was subsequently continued orally for 3 months. The immunosuppressive treatment included oral CyA from day 5 after a short course of anti-T-lymphocyte immunoglobulins. Hypertension was treated with oral labetolol in combination with guanfacine if necessary. Antihypertensive medication was prescribed significantly more often (16 vs 7 patients; p < 0.05) in the placebo group. Standing systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the isradipine group. The standing diastolic and both systolic and diastolic sitting blood pressures were similar in both groups. After 3 months, patients' mean serum creatinine was significantly lower with isradipine than with placebo (142.0 +/- 11.9 vs 164.0 +/- 10.8 mumol/l; p < 0.05). With isradipine, a significantly higher dose of CyA was needed to achieve adequate plasma levels (8.0 +/- 0.5 vs 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/kg/day; p < 0.01).

Because many of the studies on aggressive populations allowed the use of concomitant medications, it is unclear whether the efficacy of each drug in a particular population is dependent on the presence of other medications, such as antipsychotic agents. Finally, one needs to be circumspect in inferring efficacy of a particular drug in aggressive patients with neuropsychiatric conditions other than the ones in which some efficacy has been established. Lithium appears to be an effective treatment of aggression among nonepileptic prison inmates, mentally retarded and handicapped patients, and among conduct-disordered children with explosive behavior. Certainly, lithium would be the treatment of choice in bipolar patients with excessive irritability and anger outbursts, and it has been shown to be effective in this population. Anticonvulsant medications are the treatment of choice for patients with outbursts of rage and abnormal EEG findings. The efficacy of these drugs in patients without a seizure disorder, however, remains to be established, with the exception perhaps of valproate and carbamazepine. In fact, dyphenylhydantoin did not appear to be effective in treating aggressive behavior in children with temper tantrums and was found to be effective in only a prison population. There is some evidence for the efficacy of carbamazepine and valproate in treating pathologic aggression in patients with dementia, organic brain syndrome, psychosis, and personality disorders. As Yudofsky et al point out in their review of the literature, although traditional antipsychotic drugs have been used widely to treat aggression, there is little evidence for their effectiveness in treating aggression beyond their sedative effect in agitated patients or their antiaggressive effect among patients whose aggression is related to active psychosis. Antipsychotic agents appear to be effective in treating psychotic aggressive patients, conduct-disordered children, and mentally retarded patients, with only modest effects in the management of pathologic aggression in patients with dementia. Furthermore, at least in one study, these drugs were found to be associated with increased aggressiveness in mentally retarded subjects. On the other hand, atypical antipsychotic agents (i.e., clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine) may be more effective than traditional antipsychotic drugs in aggressive and violent populations, as they have shown efficacy in patients with dementia, brain injury, mental retardation, and personality disorders. Similarly, benzodiazepines can reduce agitation and irritability in elderly and demented populations, but they also can induce behavioral disinhibition. Therefore, one should be careful in using this class of drugs in patients with pathologic aggression. Beta-blockers appear to be effective in many different neuropsychiatric conditions. These drugs seem effective in reducing violent and assaultive behavior in patients with dementia, brain injury, schizophrenia, mental retardation, and organic brain syndrome. As pointed out by Campbell et al in their review of the literature, however, systematic research is lacking, and little is known about the efficacy and safety of beta-blockers in children and adolescents with pathologic aggression. Although widely used in the management of pathologic aggression, the use of this class of drugs has been limited partially by marked hypotension and bradycardia, which are side effects common at the higher doses. The usefulness of the antihypertensive drug clonidine in the treatment of pathologic aggression has not been assessed adequately, and only marginal benefits were observed with this drug in irritable autistic and conduct disorder children. Psychostimulants seem to be effective in reducing aggressiveness in brain-injured patients as well as in violent adolescents with oppositional or conduct disorders, particu", "outbound_citations": ["10621763", "1775598", "9400343", "9133758", "8911223", "8909331", "8778118", "8919710", "8743642", "8854307", "7592502", "8778124", "7542840", "7791258", "7560119", "7639092", "7751258", "7779245", "7714224", "8749613", "8851652", "7633640", "7712052", "7814344", "7884602", "7814828", "8071257", "8195453", "7951640", "8251047", "8216696", "7848377", "8351310", "8354736", "8498878", "8489326", "8496122", "8463442", "8432495", "8431099", "8093942", "8345158", "1477491", "1362095", "1451447", "1357425", "1417466", "1418368", "1479049", "1479052", "1486151", "1512389", "1495689", "1642129", "1554179", "1549549", "1347291", "1541605", "1552036", "1546547", "1513924", "1353014", "1403624", "1770157", "1683641", "2051152", "2019899", "2016248", "1853957", "1705151", "2284325", "1978689", "2258454", "2228924", "2407208", "2371370", "1970469", "2813804", "2809577", "2508726", "2768542", "2750978", "2742020", "2568649", "2652180", "2648867", "2521094", "3058683", "3048122", "3406235", "3276280", "3252875", "2902642", "3442256", "3667502", "3676607", "3610074", "3597327", "3553166", "3115350", "3813167", "3525523", "3093046", "3521532", "2872823", "3517228", "2871055", "2870057", "3512535", "2417773", "3942284", "3840045", "3894338", "2861874", "2411650", "6442441", "6478123", "6428371", "6691426", "6132108", "6819289", "6124747", "6123658", "7208734", "7417923", "443463", "369395", "201320", "320219", "984241", "1092398", "17896753", "4724658", "4948869", "4998393", "5101285", "4911365", "4890812", "5690693", "14289361", "13808146", "13463189"], "inbound_citations": ["37046974", "36674429", "36741582", "34815379", "33572109", "30716416", "30690521", "31655730", "29641834", "29723722", "28754408", "26776902", "27255267", "26913173", "27024905", "26086546"], "label": "0"}

The criteria of what constitutes ADHD in children have broadened, and there is a growing appreciation of the persistence of ADHD into adolescence and adulthood. As a result, more children (especially girls), adolescents, and adults are being diagnosed and treated with stimulant medication, and children are being treated for longer periods of time. Epidemiologic studies using standardized diagnostic criteria suggest that 3% to 6% of the school-aged population (elementary through high school) may suffer from ADHD, although the percentage of US youth being treated for ADHD is at most at the lower end of this prevalence range. Pharmacotherapy, particularly use of stimulants, has been extensively studied and generally provides significant short-term symptomatic and academic improvement. There is little evidence that stimulant abuse or diversion is currently a major problem, particularly among those with ADHD, although recent trends suggest that this could increase with the expanding production and use of stimulants.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough some children are being diagnosed as having ADHD with insufficient evaluation and in some cases stimulant medication is prescribed when treatment alternatives exist, there is little evidence of widespread overdiagnosis or misdiagnosis of ADHD or of widespread overprescription of methylphenidate by physicians.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37063364", "35837629", "34623720", "33597331", "33395356", "33158057", "32203398", "31658722", "31002267", "30705623", "30185215", "29922112", "28363250", "25015584", "28532329", "27115479", "27629707", "27306789", "27055108", "27021056", "27323572"], "label": "0"}

Conventional stimulant medications are recognized by both specialists and parents as useful symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, approximately 30% of ADHD children treated with them do not respond adequately or cannot tolerate the associated adverse effects. Such difficulties highlight the need for alternative safe and effective medications in the treatment of this disorder. Selegiline is a type B monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that is metabolized to amphetamine and methamphetamine stimulant compounds that may be useful in the treatment of ADHD. The authors undertook this study to further evaluate, under double-blind and controlled conditions, the efficacy of selegiline for ADHD in children. A total of 28 children with ADHD as defined by DSM IV were randomized to selegiline or methylphenidate dosed on an age and weight-adjusted basis at selegiline 5 mg/day (under 5 years) and 10 mg/day (over 5 years) (Group 1) and methylphenidate 1 mg/kg/day (Group 2) for a 4-week double-blind clinical trial. The principal measure of the outcome was the Teacher and Parent ADHD Rating Scale. Patients were assessed by a child psychiatrist at baseline, 14 and 28 days after the medication started. No significant differences were observed between the two protocols on the Parent and Teacher Rating Scale scores. Although the number of dropouts in the methylphenidate group was higher than in the selegiline group, there was no significant difference between the two protocols in terms of the dropouts. Decreased appetite, difficulty falling asleep and headaches were observed more in the methylphenidate group. The results of this study must be considered preliminary, but they do suggest that selegiline may be beneficial in the treatment of ADHD. In addition, a tolerable side effect profile may be considered as one of the advantages of selegiline in the treatment of ADHD.", "outbound_citations": ["16010903", "11573866", "23981796", "11587468", "11052409", "10570690", "9708846", "9294377", "27520752", "8626348", "8919704", "8780073", "8714313", "8961775", "7995016", "8407753", "8442708", "3058088"], "inbound_citations": ["37087864", "36983841", "36326299", "35495050", "35479216", "32852645", "29744873", "29460165", "28664398", "27803666", "27286139", "26646400", "26844979", "26884787"], "label": "0"}

The incidence of EPS in the OLZ treated group compared to the haloperidol and risperidone treatment groups in which over 100 patients were included is analyzed in the present work. The study duration was 6 months and the data were collected by 293 psychiatrists from mental health care areas.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe percentage of patients who presented at least one adverse event (AE) (p 3/4 0.001) was less in the OLZ groups (47.8%) compared to those of the HAL (79.8%) and RIS (57.2%) subgroups. A lower percentage of patients treated with OLZ (36.9%) presented EPS in comparison to the RIS (49.6%) and HAL (76%) subgroups (p 3/4 0.001). A lower rate of patients from the OLZ group (10.2%) received anticholinergic treatments compared to the RIS (19.9%) and HAL (44%) subgroups (p< 0.001 in both cases).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOLZ-treated patients presented a lower incidence of EPS and required less anticholinergic treatment than the HAL and RIS treated patients.

Publications in all languages were searched from all relevant databases and all randomized controlled trials comparing clozapine with newer atypical drugs were included. The review and meta-analysis includes eight studies, most of them short in duration. Newer atypical drugs were broadly similar to clozapine when improvement was measured using a psychosis symptom rating scale or a global index. There was a trend for clozapine to be more effective than the others for positive symptoms, and less effective for the negative symptoms. The adverse effect profile of clozapine and newer atypical drugs was dissimilar: while clozapine produced more fatigue, hypersalivation, and orthostatic dizziness, new atypical drugs, with the exception of olanzapine, produced more extrapyramidal symptoms. As these results were obtained from few studies and a relatively small amount of patients, the equal effectiveness and tolerability of new atypical drugs in comparison with clozapine is not yet demonstrated.

In a double masked prospective clinical trial, 217 eyes from 217 patients were randomly assigned to receive either dorzolamide 2 h before and placebo 1 h before Nd : YAG laser capsulotomy or placebo 2 h before and apraclonidine 1 h before the procedure. Inclusion criteria were secondary cataracts with reduction in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA < 20/40), absence of manifest or suspected glaucoma and no known hypersensitivity to the study drugs. IOP was measured 2 h and 1 h before applying the laser, and 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 7 days after. Results. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding the IOP 2 h and 1 h before the procedure, and 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 7 days after the laser treatment (p values, respectively: 0.077, 0.21, 0.085, 0.36, and 0.60).

Regional anesthetic and analgesic techniques can attenuate this \"stress response\" and reduce the occurrence rate of adverse perioperative events; however, their use in the postoperative period is logistically difficult and costly. The present study was undertaken to evaluate whether transdermal administration of the alpha2 adrenergic-receptor agonist, clonidine, can be used as a pharmacologic means of blunting the stress response throughout the perioperative period.\n\n\nDESIGN\nDouble-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients undergoing pancreatico-biliary surgery.\n\n\nSETTING\nOperating rooms and surgical intensive care unit of a major university teaching hospital.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nForty patients scheduled for major upper abdominal surgery.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients received either clonidine (0.2 mg orally and a clonidine TTS-3 patch the evening before surgery and 0.3 mg orally on call to the operating room) or matched oral and transdermal placebo.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nHeart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, plasma catecholamine, clonidine, interleukin-6 concentrations, and 24-hr urine cortisol and nitrogen excretion were measured the day before surgery and daily thereafter for 72 hrs postoperatively. Preoperative transdermal (and oral) clonidine administration resulted in therapeutic plasma clonidine concentrations throughout the perioperative period (1.54 +/- .07 [SEM] microg/mL). Clonidine reduced preoperative epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations by 65%. Plasma catecholamine concentrations increased in both groups following surgery but were markedly lower throughout the postoperative period in patients receiving clonidine. Patients receiving clonidine had a reduced frequency rate of postoperative hypertension. Clonidine had no effect on plasma interleukin-6 concentration, urine cortisol excretion, or urine nitrogen excretion. No adverse effects of clonidine administration were observed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe combined administration of oral and transdermal clonidine effectively attenuated the catecholamine response to surgical stress throughout the postoperative study period. Clonidine administration produced specific sympatholytic effects, since other elements of the stress response were not attenuated. Undesirable side effects were not noted. The sustained sympatholytic effects we observed suggest that alpha2 adrenergic-receptor agonists may offer a pharmacologic means of modifying the sympathoadrenal response to injury, and may be useful in reducing perioperative complications.", "outbound_citations": ["8267195", "8363066", "1642343", "1729933", "1990896", "1997045", "2502935", "2724504", "3184350", "3605732", "3606284", "3296854", "3017039", "3942335", "4058261"], "inbound_citations": ["35514362", "29509957", "28637741", "27742030"], "label": "0"}

Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was conducted to predict group membership. The four variables loaded onto two discriminant functions with good specificity: phonologic decoding, letter naming speed, and arithmetic defined the first function; color naming speed defined the second function. Both ADHD groups were significantly slower in color naming than controls, but did not differ from one another. DFA correctly classified 96% of the control group, 91% of ADHD + RD, and 82% of ADHD only. A subset of children in the ADHD groups participated subsequently in an acute, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with three single doses (10, 25, 20 mg) of methylphenidate. Methylphenidate selectively improved color-naming speed but had no effect on the speed of naming letters or digits.

Sixteen ASA physical status I or II patients were randomly assigned to receive either clonidine 150 [micro sign]g or a placebo. Anesthesia was induced 45 min later by thiopental, fentanyl, and vecuronium IV and was maintained by the administration of 0.6% isoflurane. We monitored central core (tympanic) temperature and skin surface temperatures at the forearm and the fingertip during the 2 h after the induction of anesthesia before surgery. We estimated skin blood flow at the level of the forearm by using laser Doppler during the same period. The core temperature decreased comparably in the two groups of patients, from 37.1 +/- 0.2[degree sign]C to 35.3 +/- 0.4[degree sign]C and from 37.1 +/- 0.2[degree sign]C to 35.5 +/- 0.3[degree sign]C in the clonidine and placebo groups, respectively. The forearm-fingertip surface temperature gradient decreased similarly in the two groups. There was no evidence of cutaneous vasoconstriction. The laser Doppler index at the fingertip increased similarly in the two groups, as did the forearm-fingertip temperature gradient. We conclude that premedication with clonidine does not significantly impair the profile of central hypothermia induced by heat redistribution after the induction of anesthesia. Implications: The induction of general anesthesia is associated with redistribution hypothermia. This study shows that premedication with oral clonidine does not worsen the decrease in core temperature resulting from general anesthesia.

Short-acting intramuscular formulations are used to manage acute psychotic episodes. On the other hand, long-acting compounds, also called \"depot\", are administered as antipsychotic maintenance treatment to ensure compliance and to eliminate bioavailability problems related to absorption and first pass metabolism. Adverse effects of antipsychotics have been studied with particular respect to oral versus short- and long-acting intramuscular formulations of the different compounds. For short-term intramuscular preparations the main risk with classical compounds are hypotension and extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Data on the incidence of EPS with depot formulations are controversial: some studies point out that the incidence of EPS is significantly higher in patients receiving depot preparations, whereas others show no difference between oral and depot antipsychotics. Studies on the strategies for switching patients from oral to depot treatment suggest that this procedure is reasonably well tolerated, so that in clinical practice depot antipsychotic therapy is usually begun while the oral treatment is still being administered, with gradual tapering of the oral dose. Efficacy, pharmacodynamics and clinical pharmacokinetics of haloperidol decanoate, fluphenazine enanthate and decanoate, clopenthixol decanoate, zuclopenthixol decanoate and acutard, flupenthixol decanoate, perphenazine enanthate, pipothiazine palmitate and undecylenate, and fluspirilene are reviewed. In addition, the intramuscular preparations of atypical antipsychotics and clinical uses are reviewed. Olanzapine and ziprasidone are available only as short-acting preparations, while risperidone is to date the only novel antipsychotic available as depot formulation. To date, acutely ill, agitated psychotic patients have been treated with high parenteral doses of typical antipsychotics, which often cause serious EPS, especially dystonic reactions. Intramuscular formulations of novel antipsychotics (olanzapine and ziprasidone), which appear to have a better tolerability profile than typical compounds, showed an equivalent efficacy to parenteral typical agents in the acute treatment of psychoses. However, parenteral or depot formulations of atypical antipsychotics are not yet widely available.", "outbound_citations": ["7846204", "3933035", "12505137", "12003684", "11925292", "11777738", "11581108", "11581109", "11476123", "11431240", "11287404", "11401000", "11305699", "11235922", "11232747", "10796446", "11206599", "11099280", "10993133", "10796448", "10796442", "10796438", "10796445", "10478897", "10468314", "10080557", "9825249", "9519061", "9474440", "9217519", "9242840", "8932892", "8666571", "8775759", "8829787", "8866767", "7656507", "7622829", "7917075", "7514366", "8078952", "7912473", "8195579", "7520856", "7907570", "1362569", "1496124", "1351333", "1361081", "1673123", "1684394", "1684308", "1967847", "2188797", "2568662", "2686478", "2689040", "2619982", "2570086", "2572322", "2575796", "2459765", "3387514", "3327370", "3322467", "3555385", "3813167", "3545764", "2880839", "3788652", "2876879", "2870944", "3512622", "3514689", "3763650", "2865251", "3907278", "3865500", "2863088", "6692965", "6150492", "6150493", "6381033", "6134718", "6674820", "6139394", "7172160", "7119135", "6126237", "7074295", "7141812", "6113735", "7011249", "6109455", "7468294", "6110312", "7393999", "6996426", "552863", "504342", "84989", "367182", "98127", "349597", "24061", "345313", "590024", "22515", "18242", "1020683", "1178806", "4566388", "4920311", "14141840", "8923093", "9452941", "363702", "7185769", "8094628", "8748041", "2687895", "2687894", "8104468", "1091162"], "inbound_citations": ["36915909", "35418448", "33445224", "33888983", "33888983", "29569082", "28956466", "29390205", "28910830", "27574460", "26926462"], "label": "0"}

Agitation presents a barrier to therapy, interrupting the typical physician-patient alliance and creating a disruptive, even hazardous, environment. Rapid assessment and effective treatment are necessary to manage agitation and, potentially, to shorten the time to recovery. Methods One hundred forty-eight acutely agitated patients received either: rapid initial dose escalation (RIDE) in which up to 40 mg of oral olanzapine was allowed on days 1 and 2, up to 30 mg on days 3 and 4, and 5 to 20 mg thereafter; or usual clinical practice (UCP) in which patients received 10 mg/d olanzapine plus up to 4 mg lorazepam on days 1 and 2, up to 2 mg on days 3 and 4, and olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d thereafter. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC: poor impulse control, tension, hostility, uncooperativeness, and excitement) measured at 24 hours was the primary measure. Secondary assessments of agitation and safety were also performed. Results Agitation improved significantly from baseline for both treatment groups; however, improvement with the RIDE strategy was superior to UCP. The RIDE group improvement was superior on the primary efficacy measure (PANSS-Excited) at 24 hours; it was superior on all agitation measures at the end of double-blind treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated, with no clinically significant differences in safety measures. Treatment was not limited by oversedation and attention improved from baseline in both groups. Conclusions This study demonstrates the value of olanzapine in the treatment of acutely agitated patients. A new approach to olanzapine dosing that expands the initial dose range up to 40 mg/d may offer superior efficacy in rapidly and effectively controlling the symptoms of agitation.", "outbound_citations": ["15138953", "12042191", "11982448", "11913673", "11927174", "11823268", "11476123", "11431240", "11500996", "11232745", "11232746", "11154012", "10986547", "10704958", "11154014", "10394486", "10350037", "10327902", "9356581", "9330241", "9447494", "8942204", "8822534", "1971560", "2574607", "3616518", "4917967"], "inbound_citations": ["36707066", "36420692", "34338130", "32858619", "32796393", "32352565", "30843960", "30540028", "30293014", "29433934", "28844639", "29750432", "28293046", "27669496", "26851573", "27335511", "26912127", "26689942"], "label": "0"}

This study was undertaken to determine whether the addition of clonidine and neostigmine to IT bupivacaine-fentanyl would increase the duration of analgesia without increasing side effects for patients in labor.\n\n\nMETHODS\nForty-five healthy parturients in active labor were randomized to receive a 2-ml IT dose of one of the following dextrose-containing solutions using the combined spinal-epidural technique: (1) bupivacaine 2.5 mg and fentanyl 25 microg (BF); (2) BF plus clonidine 30 microg (BFC); or (3) BFC plus neostigmine 10 microg (BFCN). Pain, sensory levels, motor block, side effects, maternal vital signs, and fetal heart rate were systematically assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients administered BFCN had significantly longer analgesia (165+/-32 min) than those who received BF (90+/-21 min; P<0.001) or BFC (123+/-21 min; P<0.001). Pain scores, block characteristics, maternal vital signs, Apgar scores, maternal satisfaction, and side effects were similar among groups except for nausea, which was significantly greater in the BFCN group (P<0.05 as compared with BFC).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe addition of clonidine and neostigmine significantly increased the duration of analgesia from IT bupivacaine-fentanyl during labor, but neostigmine caused more nausea. Although serious side effects were not observed in this study, safety must be further addressed before the routine use of multiple IT drugs is advocated.", "outbound_citations": ["10072008", "9842818", "9743394", "9523808", "9322463", "9223543", "9174305", "8942591", "8712447", "8623971", "7653812", "7856901", "7856891", "7818120", "8198277", "7605758", "15636921", "8439026"], "inbound_citations": ["32139928", "29238167", "28868303", "28475555", "28975069"], "label": "0"}

Relapse, rehospitalization, limited fulfilment of social roles, and suicide remain frequent, and the economic costs are high. Current relapse rates may be two to three times higher than those that could be achieved with optimal use of therapy. Poor compliance with treatment is considered to be a significant preventable cause of poor outcome and is in turn likely to be influenced by the patient's experience of drug treatment. There is some evidence that extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), particularly akathisia and neuroleptic dysphoria, are associated with poor compliance and poor treatment outcome. Atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of EPS than do standard antipsychotics. Some (risperidone, olanzapine, and ziprasidone) show evidence of a dose-related increase in EPS, but clozapine and quetiapine have demonstrated a placebo-level incidence of EPS across the dose range. Quetiapine does not require the regular blood monitoring mandated for clozapine, and results from a patient survey indicate a high degree of patient satisfaction with treatment. While further research is needed, it is possible that wider use of medications with low EPS and high patient acceptability could promote better compliance and improve the outcome of schizophrenia treatment.", "outbound_citations": ["11768836", "11336602", "11217867", "11048905", "10787036", "10722180", "24926579", "10493082", "10625198", "10468329", "10389607", "10192829", "10078501", "10221855", "24941092", "10037163", "9812112", "9766620", "9773233", "9729687", "9675506", "9793875", "9448664", "9350955", "9270900", "19698588", "9366000", "8985472", "8792909", "8894211", "7545060", "7622833", "7481573", "7977894", "7865193", "7827396", "7916523", "7952993", "7910451", "7914044", "8279933", "8515788", "8332569", "8098178", "7904762", "1357703", "1681751", "1980954", "1979044", "2378547", "2343745", "2573481", "3215645", "2983014", "6691455", "7212946", "727898", "5652493"], "inbound_citations": ["36297286", "34735099", "33484755", "33505820", "30334674", "27816557", "27732740", "27297785"], "label": "0"}

As such, relatively little has been published regarding its in vivo effects at the dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2a (5-HT2a) receptor systems. The following study was undertaken to explore these effects across the clinical dose range and relate this information to its clinical profile.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwelve patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to doses of 150 to 600 mg/d (n=3, at 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/d) of quetiapine. After 3 weeks of treatment, D2 and 5-HT2a occupancy were measured using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, 12 to 14 hours after the last dose. Clinical efficacy and adverse effect ratings were obtained at baseline, at the time of PET scanning, and at 12 weeks. Two additional patients were included to examine the effects of the drug 2 to 3 hours after last dose.\n\n\nRESULTS\nQuetiapine was an effective antipsychotic and improved the extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation noted at baseline. It achieved these results with minimal (0%-27%) D2 occupancy 12 hours after the last dose. Study of the additional subjects revealed that quetiapine does give rise to transiently high (58%-64%) D2 occupancy 2 to 3 hours after a single dose that then decreases to minimal levels in 12 hours.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nQuetiapine shows a transiently high D2 occupancy, which decreases to very low levels by the end of the dosing interval. Quetiapine's low D2 occupancy can explain its freedom from extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin level elevation. The data suggest that transient D2 occupancy may be sufficient for its antipsychotic effect. Future studies controlling for nonpharmacological effects as well as activities on other receptors will be necessary to confirm this suggestion.", "outbound_citations": ["10739409", "10080558", "9989565", "9892300", "9690696", "9690698", "9672060", "9659858", "9577836", "9497016", "9350955", "9372541", "9335088", "9274589", "9270900", "9193196", "9218163", "9194079", "9106913", "8599393", "7673658", "7840348", "8103793", "1352677", "2182776", "2571717", "2574607", "3259509", "3616518", "6149133", "6140171", "945467", "4917967", "5941929"], "inbound_citations": ["36672638", "36143193", "35131908", "34204223", "33345826", "32796393", "32649611", "32637286", "32228235", "32649611", "30966863", "31688449", "31496702", "31242884", "31214054", "30928863", "31057354", "30924677", "30449883", "30056792", "29915922", "34079927", "27664299", "28754408", "28970021", "29225337", "28834857", "28882405", "28647739", "28265019", "28088727", "28443529", "28368577", "28271741", "27381554", "26854815", "27466220", "27091214", "26818045", "26811292", "26914771", "27830625", "26670787"], "label": "0"}

Some drug-induced agranulocytoses such as clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CA) may be regarded as an idiosyncratic drug reaction because of its preclinical and clinical characteristics. To study some aspects of the genetic background of CA further, polymorphisms of specific metabolizing enzyme systems of clozapine were examined. Thirty-one schizophrenic patients with CA and 77 schizophrenic comparison subjects without this adverse effect underwent genotyping of a recently discovered G(-463)A polymorphism of myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene and cytochrome P4502D6. Neither the MPO mutation nor specific genotypes of cytochrome P4502D6 were associated with CA. Both were equally distributed among CA patients and controls. Thus, our data suggest lack of evidence of an association of CA and genetically variable activity of these specific drug metabolizing enzymes; however, this may be due to statistical reasons only. Thus, further studies with greater CA samples are necessary to draw final conclusions about these genetically based hypotheses.", "outbound_citations": ["11041319", "9766845", "9384460", "9371491", "9012401", "1545398"], "inbound_citations": ["34461790", "34209185", "30767710", "30319405", "27168101", "28948574", "28418011"], "label": "0"}

The study design was prospective, double-blinded, and randomized. Ninety ASA physical status I or II patients scheduled for bunionectomy or hammer toe repair were randomized to receive ankle or metatarsal blocks with plain 1.73% lidocaine (Group L), 1.73% lidocaine with 10 micro gram/mL of clonidine added (Group C10), or 1.73% lidocaine with 20 micro gram/mL clonidine (Group C20). Time from the performance of the block to 1) loss of sensation to pinprick, 2) return of sensation to pinprick, 3) onset of postsurgical pain, and 4) time of first oral pain medication intake were recorded. Beginning at 1 h after the completion of the block, visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal pain scores were recorded every 30 min. Additional postoperative oral pain medication required in the first 9 h after the block was also recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze intergroup differences in the VAS and verbal pain scores, the time to first reported pain, the time to first oral pain medication, and the total amount of oral pain medications required. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze the VAS and verbal pain scores overall and integrated assessment of pain scores and rescue medication was per-formed. Adverse events were also recorded for each group. There were no differences among the three groups with regard to overall VAS pain scores although Group C10 had significantly better verbal pain scores after the first 3 h (P < 0.05). There was also no difference in time to loss or return of pinprick sensation. Group C10 had a longer time to first reported pain (P < 0.01), a longer time to first oral pain medication (P < 0.01), a lower average total dose of oral pain medication required (P < 0.05), and a lower integrated assessment of pain and medication (P < 0.01) than Group L. More patients in Group C10 reported no pain postoperatively (P < 0.01) and no pain medication taken (P < 0.01) than Group L. Group C20 results suggested no statistically significant improvement over plain lidocaine. One patient in Group C20 experienced significant hypotension postoperatively. pH determinations and chemical analysis by capillary electrophoresis showed no significant change in composition of the solutions when clonidine was mixed with lidocaine and stored at 4 degrees C for 1 wk. Compared to 1.73% lidocaine, combining clonidine (10 micro gram/mL) with lidocaine for local anesthetic block for foot surgery significantly increases the duration and quality of postoperative analgesia.

Nonresponders to d-amphetamine had the lowest alpha2-receptor binding compared to responders and controls.

Bupropion, an antidepressant of the aminoketone class, is relatively free of adverse sexual effects. In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) and sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, were found to be similarly efficacious in the treatment of outpatients with moderate to severe depression. This report describes the results of a double-blind comparison of the sexual side effect profiles of bupropion SR and sertraline. Two hundred forty-eight patients who had received a diagnosis of moderate to severe major depression were randomly assigned to receive treatment with bupropion SR (100-300 mg/day) or sertraline (50-200 mg/day) for 16 weeks. Eligible patients were required to be in a stable relationship and to have normal sexual functioning. Sexual functioning was assessed by the investigator at each clinic visit using investigator-rated structured interviews. A significantly greater percentage of sertraline-treated patients (63% and 41% of men and women, respectively) developed sexual dysfunction compared with bupropion SR-treated patients (15% and 7%, respectively). Sexual dysfunction was noted as early as day 7 in sertraline-treated patients at a dose of 50 mg/day and persisted until the end of the 16-week treatment phase. Four patients, all of whom were treated with sertraline, discontinued from the study prematurely because of sexual dysfunction. Given the similar efficacy of the two drugs in treating depression, bupropion SR may be a more appropriate antidepressant choice than sertraline in patients for whom sexual dysfunction is a concern.", "outbound_citations": ["9541153", "9448656", "9164423", "9129565", "8749600", "7665537", "7951639", "8276736", "8331089", "1619520", "1907963", "2258378", "2258379", "3370276", "3863548", "3919069", "6131885"], "inbound_citations": ["35255754", "35076581", "33191796", "30875818", "29523488", "29141805", "28885410", "27514298", "27141292", "26519340"], "label": "0"}

Recent research has reported that olanzapine improves cognitive functioning in relapsing schizophrenia followed in an outpatient setting. Whether olanzapine will have an effect on improving cognitive function in chronic schizophrenics who have been hospitalized for long periods of time, and have shown a poor response to other conventional and atypical neuroleptics, has not been established. This study investigated cognitive function in chronic medication refractory schizophrenics who were treated with olanzapine or haloperidol in a double-blind study for 8 wk, and followed in an open olanzapine study for several additional months. Patients were evaluated with psychopathology rating scales and a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline, end of double-blind and end of open-label phases of the study. At the end of the double-blind phase there were no significant differences between olanzapine and haloperidol, except for a trend for improvement on the Wisconsin Card Sort Test on olanzapine, which was significant at traditional but not corrected significance levels. After an additional 3 months of treatment with olanzapine doses of 20-40 mg/d, our statistical analysis showed significant improvement on overall neuropsychological test performance and specific cognitive tasks assessing verbal memory. However, these open-label results are difficult to interpret definitively because of the lack of a comparison drug group and the olanzapine dose escalation over time. Neurocognitive changes were not correlated with changes in psychopathology as assessed by PANSS or SANS scores.", "outbound_citations": ["10711911", "10190225", "10416729", "10667750", "10416727", "10416728", "9818633", "9130306", "9090331", "9090332", "8914115", "8887990", "8610818", "8541247", "7905258", "1363583", "2574607", "3616518", "18839484", "1009768", "4917967"], "inbound_citations": ["37187727", "33812977", "26842482"], "label": "0"}

A Detailed User's Guide was developed to train clinicians in the use of the new CGI-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) for rating severity of manic and depressive episodes and the degree of change from the immediately preceding phase and from the worst phase of illness. The revised scale and manual provide a focused set of instructions to facilitate the reliability of these ratings of mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness during treatment of an acute episode or in longer-term illness prophylaxis.

The present study introduces a revised CPRS (CPRS-R) which has norms derived from a large, representative sample of North American children, uses confirmatory factor analysis to develop a definitive factor structure, and has an updated item content to reflect recent knowledge and developments concerning childhood behavior problems. Exploratory and confirmatory factor-analytic results revealed a seven-factor model including the following factors: Cognitive Problems, Oppositional, Hyperactivity-Impulsivity, Anxious-Shy, Perfectionism, Social Problems, and Psychosomatic. The psychometric properties of the revised scale appear adequate as demonstrated by good internal reliability coefficients, high test-retest reliability, and effective discriminatory power. Advantages of the CPRS-R include a corresponding factor structure with the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised and comprehensive symptom coverage for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related disorders. Factor congruence with the original CPRS as well as similarities with other parent rating scales are discussed.", "outbound_citations": ["9700520", "1539086", "1770964", "2320703", "2312653",

Their growth in response to GH treatment (change in height standard deviation score [SDS]) was compared with that of patients with IGHD or ISS who were not treated for ADHD, by using a stepwise multiple regression analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the IGHD cohort, there were 184 patients who were being treated for ADHD and 2313 who were not. In the ISS cohort there were 117 patients who were being treated for ADHD and 1283 who were not. There was a higher percentage of males being treated for ADHD in both cohorts. In the IGHD cohort, the change in height SDS was positively associated with the number of years of GH treatment, parents' heights, body mass index, and GH injection schedule, and was negatively associated with height SDS at the initiation of GH therapy, age, and maximum stimulated GH level. The use of methylphenidate or pemoline had a negative effect on the change in height SDS, but the magnitude of the effect was small. Similar effects were noted in the ISS cohort, but body mass index and the use of methylphenidate or pemoline had no effect on the change in height SDS.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nConcurrent ADHD therapy is associated with a slight decrease in the change in height SDS during GH treatment in patients with IGHD but not in those with ISS. Even in IGHD, the magnitude of the effect is small and should not deter the use of such concurrent therapy.", "outbound_citations": ["8445013", "1564024", "1935818", "2348293", "2677938", "3389862", "2897907", "3722327", "3513479", "6728523", "6693678", "6889010", "7145556", "34681", "420153"], "inbound_citations": ["37086829", "37065761", "34297331", "27837176"], "label": "1"}

Following Caesarean section delivery, 60 patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the four following PCA regimens (15 patients per group) for the relief of post-operative pain by the epidural route: sufentanil 2 micrograms mL-1 in 0.9% NaCl, demand dose 5 micrograms i.e. 2.5 mL, (group S+ with, group S without an infusion at 2.5 mL hr-1) or sufentanil 2 micrograms mL-1 + clonidine 3 micrograms mL-1, demand dose 5 micrograms sufentanil + 7.5 micrograms clonidine i.e. 2.5 mL (group SC+ with and SC without an infusion of 2.5 ml hr-1). The other PCA settings (Bard I PCA pump) were a lock out of interval of 10 min and a 1 h limit of 20 micrograms sufentanil and 30 micrograms clonidine i.e. 10 mL. The parameters measured were the analgesic drug consumption and number of dose demands during the first 24 h, pain scores at 6 h intervals, side effects and quality of sleep. The concurrent infusion increased the dose requirements regardless of the content of the syringe. Consumption of sufentanil was the highest in those patients receiving the plain solution with a basal infusion. Clonidine addition reduced the dose requirements but only significantly in those receiving the background infusion. Patients treated with the mixture tended to reach lower pain scores than those receiving sufentanil only without basal rate. Patients receiving the mixture with basal rate requested significantly fewer additional demands compared with the three other groups, but this did not influence the quality of sleep. Since side effects were more frequently registered in the patients in this group, it was concluded that the optimum regimen was the sufentanil-clonidine combination but with deletion of the basal rate.", "outbound_citations": ["7802305", "7978130", "8498662", "1539812", "1539846", "2048658", "2240674", "2143638", "2190502", "2684251", "2929900"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

One hundred eighty-four subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive either RP or a CN, and 165 of them completed the follow-up. Outcome measures were taken at 3, 6, and 12 months and included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. Within this 12-month follow-up, RP was found to be superior to CNs in terms of both the average change in score from baseline on the PANSS (p = 0.006) and the proportion of good responders (as defined by a 20% decrease in total PANSS scores;p = 0.03). For positive symptoms, the effectiveness of the RP treatment tended to increase over time. At 12 months, the percentage of good responders in the RP group was twice as large as that in the CN group (30% vs. 15%;p = 0.03). The superiority of RP over CNs was constant over the three dose categories. In both the RP and the CN groups, the maximum decrease in psychopathology was achieved with the lowest dose range. A worsening of akathisia was less frequent in subjects receiving RP than in those receiving CNs (p = 0.02). In conclusion, this study showed that, compared with CNs, RP is beneficial in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia and that some of these benefits may appear only after longer-term treatment.", "outbound_citations": ["9522104", "9448657", "7545060", "7514366", "7508675", "7683702", "1375801", "1293667", "3616518"], "inbound_citations": ["27078222", "27045703", "27052109"], "label": "0"}

We hypothesized that women would show a greater response to either medication than men, particularly among first admission, premenopausal women. DSM-III-R schizophrenia inpatients (700 women and 1295 men) were randomly assigned to a 6-week trial of Olz vs. Hal.

Findings showed that women on olanzapine had a greater drop in overall symptomatology by week 4 than any other group, and their level of symptomatology remained lower throughout the 6-week trial. The sex differences in treatment response in olanzapine compared with haloperidol were, in part, dependent on chronicity and, in women, menopausal status. That is, first episode women on haloperidol exhibited an increase in symptomatology over the 6-week trial compared to their male counterparts, while multiply hospitalized women had a better treatment response on haloperidol than their male counterparts.

Studies in methamphetamine abusers have also documented significant loss of DA transporters (used as markers of the DA terminal) that are associated with slower motor function and decreased memory. The extent to which the loss of DA transporters predisposes methamphetamine abusers to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinsonism is unclear and may depend in part on the degree of recovery. Here we assessed the effects of protracted abstinence on the loss of DA transporters in striatum, in methamphetamine abusers using positron emission tomography and [11C]d-threo-methylphenidate (DA transporter radioligand). Brain DA transporters in five methamphetamine abusers evaluated during short abstinence (<6 months) and then retested during protracted abstinence (12\u201317 months) showed significant increases with protracted abstinence (caudate, +19%; putamen, +16%). Although performance in some of the tests for which we observed an association with DA transporters showed some improvement, this effect was not significant. The DA transporter increases with abstinence could indicate that methamphetamine-induced DA transporter loss reflects temporary adaptive changes (i.e., downregulation), that the loss reflects DA terminal damage but that terminals can recover, or that remaining viable terminals increase synaptic arborization. Because neuropsychological tests did not improve to the same extent, this suggests that the increase of the DA transporters was not sufficient for complete function recovery. These findings have treatment implications because they suggest that protracted abstinence may reverse some of methamphetamine-induced alterations in brain DA terminals.", "outbound_citations": ["11259523", "11229977", "11085321", "10899292", "10823899", "10479674", "10460271", "10406971", "9763484", "9715805", "9619159", "9555003", "9359594", "8923661", "8640565", "8627383", "8691238", "8809863", "8523098", "7929663", "8265656", "8363363", "1379014", "18222819", "2384545", "2720435", "6120843", "PMC6782530", "PMC48106", "PMC6792853", "PMC6782463", "PMC18764", "PMC6579154"], "inbound_citations": ["37276836", "36982742", "36847827", "36592797", "36581170", "36462584", "36358429", "36190973", "36136203", "36077488", "35992952", "35936499", "35784841", "35785575", "36845989", "35422687", "35324057", "35257830", "34623593", "34610287", "34606820", "34535563", "34411367", "34344290", "35209797", "34138411", "34082123", "33993207", "33935636", "33765981", "33754484", "33737066", "33679483", "33840374", "33560690", "33540617", "33524275", "33980544", "33521229", "33983546", "33362606", "33093821", "32777257", "32676729", "32714215", "32628679", "32462615", "32416183", "32408136", "32273837", "32092625", "33437733", "32035311", "31951909", "31995187", "31803080", "31600226", "31692967", "31228610", "31150652", "31385260", "31291035", "31209787", "31164169", "31214054", "31069753", "30919007", "30654115", "29953935", "4139480", "31273702", "30380522", "30077198", "29934756", "29915529", "29665491", "29360540", "29292157", "29881412", "29475448", "28778737", "28224681", "29540913", "27917569", "29288365", "28623859", "29065400", "28630283", "26455459", "28297025", "28351169", "27936284", "28422859", "27392268", "28287691", "28539999", "27241765", "27993694", "28251590", "28243833", "28178354", "27649775", "27519465", "27814639", "28589520", "27502592", "27450578", "27316905", "30220787", "27484318", "27338968", "27310146", "27323860", "27275601", "26946269", "26503310", "27137938", "27115910", "27098516", "27082425", "26799527", "26638833", "25377775", "26321315", "26873080", "26465779", "25816790", "26828702", "26367473", "26819778", "26806782", "26520437", "27288074", "26806776", "26873849", "25535855", "25451127", "26384529", "26526398", "26208874", "25655926", "26484527", "26283213", "26379484", "26330898", "26321910", "25957927", "26096461", "25700612", "25703219", "25532915", "25861156", "25788874"], "label": "0"}

Immediately postoperatively the patients of group A received a continuous infusion of the study solution (5-8 ml/h), the patients of group B received a baseline continuous epidural infusion (3 ml/h), additionally they could self-administer 5 ml boli via a PCEA device. Measurements included the total dose of infused drug solution, pain at rest and on exercise by a visual analogue scale, cardiorespiratory data and side effects within the first 24 hours postoperatively. A standardised interview on analgesia and side effects was held 2 days after surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe PCEA group demanded less epidural analgesics (gr. B: 112 +/- 33 ml vs. gr. A: 135 +/- 20 ml) p < 0.01). Both continuous epidural infusion and patient-controlled administration provided very good analgesia at rest (gr. A: VAS 0.4 +/- 0.4 and gr. B: VAS 0.4 +/- 0.5) (n.s.). On exercise continuous epidural infusion of analgesics resulted in significantly lower pain scores (gr. A: 1.9 +/- 1.1) than patient-controlled application (gr. B: 3.4 +/- 1.1) (p < 0.01). We did not notice severe side effects such as respiratory depression or drop of heart rate or blood pressure.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients at rest both continuous and patient-controlled epidural administration of analgesics provides excellent analgesia after major abdominal surgery. Contrariwise, patients on exercise who could use a PCA-device experienced more pain compared to those with a continuous epidural infusion technique. On the other hand the patients of the PCA-group consumed less epidural analgesics.

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness item scores were the primary efficacy variables. Secondary efficacy variables included the BPRS positive-symptom cluster score, the Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms summary score (United States only), and the total score from the negative scale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (Europe only). Scores were analyzed using an analysis of covariance for change from baseline at end point with last observations carried forward. The model included baseline score (covariate), center, and treatment. Extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed using the Simpson-Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale; abnormal involuntary movements were assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Frequency distributions of grouped change-from-baseline scores were analyzed using chi 2 tests.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 280 patients in whom the efficacy of quetiapine was evaluated, 159 (42% of those receiving high-dose treatment; 57%, low-dose treatment; and 59%, placebo) withdrew before trial completion, primarily because of treatment failure. Significant (P < .001, BPRS; P = .003, Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness item; and P = .003, BPRS positive-symptom cluster) differences were identified between patients receiving high-dose quetiapine and placebo for both primary efficacy variables, with end point differences in the BPRS positive-symptom cluster score showing quetiapine's consistency in reducing positive symptoms. The reduction of negative symptoms was less consistent; high-dose quetiapine was superior on the Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms but not on the negative scale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Quetiapine was well tolerated and did not induce extrapyramidal symptoms, sustained elevations of prolactin, or clinically significant changes in hematologic parameters.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nQuetiapine is an effective antipsychotic with a favorable safety profile.

The initial sustained-release formulations of methylphenidate had reduced efficacy compared with immediate-release methylphenidate and were not well accepted. Tachyphylaxis was hypothesized to account for the reduced effects, and an ascending drug delivery pattern was proposed to overcome this acute tolerance.\n\n\nMETHODS\nChildren with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were evaluated in a laboratory school to characterize onset and duration of the effect of a variety of methylphenidate regimens. In a proof-of-concept study, an experimental ascending profile was established by an initial bolus followed by small increasing doses of immediate-release methylphenidate in capsules administered every 30 minutes for 8 hours. Two proof-of-product studies of a new oral once-a-day formulation to deliver methylphenidate by an osmotic pump process based on OROS (ALZA Corp, Mountain View, Calif) technology (hereafter referred to \"OROS-methylphenidate\") were conducted: a pharmacokinetic study and a pharmacodynamic study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe experimental ascending profile matched the effect of the standard regimen of methylphenidate, 3 times daily. In the pharmacokinetic study, OROS-methylphenidate treatment produced a rapid rise followed by increasing plasma concentrations that peaked 7 to 9 hours after administration. In the pharmacodynamic study, OROS-methylphenidate treatment matched the 3 times daily dosing of methylphenidate for onset and duration of efficacy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese studies demonstrate the translation of a basic science finding (acute tolerance to clinical doses of methylphenidate) into clinical application (the selection of a new drug delivery pattern for methylphenidate). This approach produced a new product (OROS-methylphenidate or Concerta), which proved to have the predicted rapid onset (with 1-2 hours) and long duration of efficacy (10-12 hours) after a single administration in the morning.", "outbound_citations": ["10214563", "11211366", "11211365", "10591283", "10511066", "10230181", "9564198", "10513459", "9183129", "8885584", "8567600", "7666894", "7630692", "7771915", "2196522", "2793805", "2706316", "3658567", "7178383", "400817"], "inbound_citations": ["37270619", "36971690", "36904432", "36002446", "34436651", "34085581", "33541479", "33009228", "32590405", "32054558", "32695728", "31581854", "31097459", "31027435", "30575407", "30681665", "29744873", "29039979", "28988700", "27183299", "27478110", "27021968", "26599576", "26349753", "26151738", "25296928", "25813457", "25757898", "25692005", "25303048", "25256402", "25127644", "25120227", "24994482", "24259638", "25598746", "23775617", "23587983", "23612436", "23564273", "22552161", "24295629", "24421659", "22084448", "22945622", "22512898", "22250610", "22654382", "23160939", "21787126", "21904084", "21904089", "21791096", "21663428", "21731894", "21733214", "22114778", "20863575", "21488750", "21469923", "21436147", "23430964", "21424163", "21368261", "21192153", "21226641", "21128692", "20973708", "20233343", "20861593", "20491612", "20521876", "20513230", "20578931", "20015192", "20093941", "19745210", "19961358", "20043136", "19013522", "20520955", "20576091", "19823900", "19803628", "19664910", "19777067", "19673602", "19519257", "19440077", "19536322", "19281853", "19366449", "19226534", "18978488", "19051222", "19220601", "18957105", "18192623", "18759645", "19727272", "18434918", "18206857", "18489664", "18555941", "18271706", "18824823", "18824827", "18278977", "18343243", "18162007", "18071840", "18095810", "17667480", "17581453", "17548486", "17395894", "17494833", "17489710", "17318414", "17190528", "17303170", "17049803", "17213010", "16927568", "17020437", "16958569", "16958567", "16950962", "16961428", "16780635", "16721314", "16670649", "16489607", "16566781", "16481664", "16102908", "16456216", "16321724", "16389216", "16680409", "16175106", "16418159", "16220213", "19030518", "15950014", "15864267", "15665152", "16296740", "15673582", "21179640", "15466120", "15466129", "15466131", "15458569", "15319016", "15225731", "15243010", "15163276", "15127013", "15076259", "14993578", "15334986", "15338577", "15322960", "14624806", "14594733", "14594346", "12831341", "12921469", "12649629", "12521359", "12410072", "12240794"], "label": "0"}

The design involved a random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study of 3 weeks' duration. After a 2- to 4-day screening period, qualified patients were assigned to either olanzapine (N = 70) or placebo (N = 69). Patients began double-blind therapy with either olanzapine, 10 mg, or placebo given once per day. After the first day of treatment, the daily dose could be adjusted upward or downward, as clinically indicated, by one capsule (olanzapine, 5 mg/day) within the allowed range of one to four capsules. The primary efficacy measure in the protocol was defined as a change from baseline to endpoint in total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale. Clinical response was defined a priori as a decrease of 50% or more from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale total score. The olanzapine group experienced significantly greater mean improvement in Young Mania Rating Scale total score than the placebo group. On the basis of the clinical response criteria, significantly more olanzapine-treated patients (48.6%) responded than those assigned to placebo (24.2%). Somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, and weight gain occurred significantly more often with olanzapine. There were no statistically significant differences between the olanzapine-treated and placebo-treated patients with respect to measures of parkinsonism, akathisia, and dyskinesias. No discontinuations of treatment due to adverse events occurred in the olanzapine treatment group. The results from this study suggest that compared with placebo, olanzapine has superior efficacy for the symptoms of acute mania.", "outbound_citations": ["10817103", "9448668", "9609675", "9510219", "9543198", "9408917", "9481807", "9401315", "9184614", "9169300", "9090331", "8626366", "8666562", "8633686", "8970500", "8823350", "7665540", "7883728", "7559373", "8279933", "8102150", "1637252", "1541605", "1671793", "2574607", "2690167", "2885878", "6089692", "6127353", "7324992", "6108577", "728692", "5041534", "4917967", "6080235"], "inbound_citations": ["37128576", "35737387", "35545157", "35303594", "35053836", "34556539", "33249552", "32631362", "32134852", "32008683", "31708055", "31669925", "31808104", "31364895", "31203678", "30905116", "29926533", "30633729", "29756288", "30041458", "29536616", "29374325", "29361880", "29357703", "29382960", "29098925", "28939419", "28417647", "28416033", "28927197", "28005435", "27816941", "28004626", "27372312", "27346789", "26542836", "26369921", "25861957", "26170669", "26060401", "25346322", "25721187"], "label": "0"}

Adult patients of either sex diagnosed as having open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled following appropriate washout from all ocular hypotensive medications. Morning IOPs of 22 to 35 mm Hg were required for entry. Patients received 0.25% or 0.5% apraclonidine 3 times a day or 0.5% timolol twice a day for 90 days.

METHOD: The computerised attendance records for all patients attending the A&E department over a 15 month period were retrospectively screened. Potential cases thus identified had their case notes systematically reviewed to confirm the history of MDMA use and to extract other relevant data. RESULTS: Forty eight consecutive MDMA related cases were identified. All were in the 15-30 year age group with the majority presenting in the early hours at weekends and having consumed the drug at a night club. The mean number of tablets consumed was two and almost 40% had taken MDMA before. Polydrug use was common with half of the sample having concurrently taken another illicit substance--most commonly other stimulants (amphetamines and cocaine). A wide range of adverse clinical features was found. The most common symptoms were vague and non-specific such as feeling strange or unwell, however many patients had collapsed or lost consciousness. The most common signs elicited were related to sympathetic overactivity, agitation/disturbed behaviour, and increased temperature. The more serious complications of delirium, seizures, and profound unconsciousness (coma) were commoner when MDMA was used in combination with other substances. CONCLUSIONS: For young adults presenting late at night at weekends and exhibiting symptoms of sympathetic overactivity, disturbed behaviour, and increased temperature (\"Saturday night fever\") the use of stimulant dance drugs especially MDMA should be suspected. As MDMA use does not appear to occur in isolation, the clinical picture is likely to be complicated by multiple rather than single drug ingestion. This poses increased diagnostic and management challenges for A&E staff who typically represent the front line response to dance drug related problems.", "outbound_citations": ["9617031", "9374881", "9088780", "9157047", "8761226", "8709087", "7994514", "7913850", "1354992", "1353390", "2908020", "3496201", "3779245"], "inbound_citations": ["36545302", "34554408", "32677861", "30068741", "28511924", "30459028", "29576829", "26216554"], "label": "0"}

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to compare the perioperative metabolic, hemodynamic, and sympathoadrenal responses to IM clonidine (2 [micro sign]g/kg) and midazolam (70 [micro sign]g/kg) premedication during ketamine anesthesia. VO2 was measured continuously using indirect calorimetry in 30 ASA physical status I patients. The patients received ketamine, mivacurium, and fentanyl for the induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was maintained using a ketamine infusion and fentanyl boluses IV. Preoperatively, both VO2 and BP decreased significantly after the administration clonidine and midazolam compared with placebo (P < 0.01). Intraoperatively, VO2 was higher in the midazolam group than in the placebo and clonidine groups (P < 0.05). Postoperatively, there were no significant differences in BP and VO2, although they stayed at lower level in the clonidine group during the whole postoperative period. Clonidine decreased pre- and postoperative plasma catecholamine concentrations (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that a midazolam-ketamine combination may induce potentially harmful metabolic stimulation, whereas the sympatholytic effects of clonidine on ketamine-anesthetized patients may be beneficial, as perioperative VO2 was decreased. Implications: Ketamine causes sympathetic stimulation with an ensuing increase in oxygen consumption. Anticipating that clonidine might attenuate this response, we measured oxygen consumption in patients undergoing surgery during ketamine anesthesia. Patients treated with a clonidine-ketamine combination had lower intra- and postoperative oxygen consumption than those treated with a midazolam-ketamine combination.

Clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, has been reported to provide [corrected] pain relief by epidural administration. Furthermore, epidural clonidine has been shown to potentiate the analgesic effect of epidural morphine. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the analgesic and side effects of epidural administration (Ep) of butorphanol and clonidine.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter giving their consents, 60 adult patients scheduled for abdominal surgeries were enrolled in this study. Prior to anesthesia induction, indwelling lumbar epidural catheters were placed in all patients who then received general anesthesia with inhalation anesthetic without narcotic analgesics. In the postoperative period, when the patients first complained of pain, they were divided into 2 equal groups of 30 patients each in a randomized and double blinded fashion with Group I receiving Ep butorphanol 0.5 mg and Group II receiving Ep butorphanol 0.5 mg plus clonidine 75 micrograms. All patients were observed for pain relief, sedation, vital signs, arterial blood gas studies and adverse effects for 12 h.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnset of pain relief with epidural butorphanol began at 5 min and peaked at 20-30 min with a duration of action lasting 4-6 h. The combination of butorphanol and clonidine had numerically superior pain relief than that of butorphanol for the first 30 min but it did not attain statistical significant difference. The duration of action with the combination group was similar to that of butorphanol alone. Incidence of adverse effects were similar in both groups except that hypotension and more pronounced sedation were observed in Group II.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study showed that the addition of clonidine to epidural butorphanol did not enhance its analgesic effect in any significant manner nor did it reduce the adverse effects. This combination does not seem to offer any advantage for clinical use.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

In addition, the relationship between measurable effects and the performance of everyday tasks such as driving is unclear. The challenge we now face is to continue the improvements in cancer pain control achieved over the last 25 years. The management of the central adverse effects of opioids must be focused on accurate assessment and careful titration of opioids against pain. Adjuvant analgesic drugs and non-drug measures should be used whenever possible, and drugs should be chosen that will not contribute to existing difficulties.

Therefore, this prospective open clinical trial was performed to investigate the safety and tolerability of the coadministration of clozapine and paroxetine under control of serum concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites and the effect of this combination treatment on psychopathological outcome was evaluated. A total of 14 patients suffering from schizophrenia or schizodepressive disorder with predominant negative symptomatology were included. The duration of the study was at least 6 weeks for each patient. Initial treatment was a monotherapy with clozapine at a daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg weight. After two measurements of serum concentrations of clozapine and metabolites during steady state conditions, an add-on therapy with 20 mg paroxetine was initiated. No concomitant medication was allowed. The main finding of our prospective study was that addition of paroxetine to a monotherapy with clozapine was a well tolerated medication that did not give rise to new clinically relevant side effects.

Its clinical hallmarks are inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, which often respond substantially to treatment with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine. Etiological theories suggest a deficit in corticostriatal circuits, particularly those components modulated by dopamine. We developed a new functional magnetic resonance imaging procedure (T2 relaxometry) to indirectly assess blood volume in the striatum (caudate and putamen) of boys 6-12 years of age in steady-state conditions. Boys with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder had higher T2 relaxation time measures in the putamen bilaterally than healthy control subjects. Relaxation times strongly correlated with the child's capacity to sit still and his accuracy in accomplishing a computerized attention task. Daily treatment with methylphenidate significantly changed the T2 relaxation times in the putamen of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, although the magnitude and direction of the effect was strongly dependent on the child's unmedicated activity state. There was a similar but nonsignificant trend in the right caudate. T2 relaxation time measures in thalamus did not differ significantly between groups, and were not affected by methylphenidate.

Previous studies have suggested an association between olanzapine treatment and hyperlipidemia. We evaluated this association using a large health care database.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was derived from the England and Wales-based General Practice Research Database, composed of 3.5 million subjects followed up between June 1, 1987, and September 24, 2000. A total of 18 309 individuals diagnosed as having schizophrenia were identified. A 6:1 matched nested case-control design was used. Conditional logistic regression was used to derive adjusted odds ratios (ORs), controlling for sex, age, and other medications and disease conditions influencing lipid levels. Antipsychotic drug exposure was defined as the receipt of at least 1 prescription for an antipsychotic medication within the 3 months before the date of diagnosis of hyperlipidemia.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 1268 incident cases of hyperlipidemia in the cohort, matched to 7598 control subjects. Olanzapine use was associated with nearly a 5-fold increase in the odds of developing hyperlipidemia compared with no antipsychotic exposure (OR, 4.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.44-8.85) (P<.001) and more than a 3-fold increase compared with those receiving conventional agents (OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.77-6.39) (P<.001). Risperidone was not associated with increased odds of hyperlipidemia compared with no antipsychotic exposure (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.60-2.11) (P =.72) or conventional antipsychotic exposure (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.44-1.52) (P =.52).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe observed a strong association between olanzapine exposure and hyperlipidemia in schizophrenic patients.

Compared with conventional antipsychotics, it has greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A than for dopamine D2 receptors. In large, well controlled trials in patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses, olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day was significantly superior to haloperidol 5 to 20 mg/day in overall improvements in psychopathology rating scales and in the treatment of depressive and negative symptoms, and was comparable in effects on positive psychotic symptoms. The 1-year risk of relapse (rehospitalisation) was significantly lower with olanzapine than with haloperidol treatment. In the first double-blind comparative study (28-week) of olanzapine and risperidone, olanzapine 10 to 20 mg/day proved to be significantly more effective than risperidone 4 to 12 mg/day in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms but not on overall psychopathology symptoms. In contrast, preliminary results from an 8-week controlled study suggested risperidone 2 to 6 mg/day was superior to olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day against positive and anxiety/depressive symptoms (p < 0.05), although consistent with the first study, both agents demonstrated similar efficacy on measures of overall psychopathology. Improvements in general cognitive function seen with olanzapine treatment in a 1-year controlled study of patients with early-phase schizophrenia, were significantly greater than changes seen with either risperidone or haloperidol. However, preliminary results from an 8-week trial showed comparable cognitive enhancing effects of olanzapine and risperidone treatment in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Several studies indicate that olanzapine has benefits against symptoms of aggression and agitation, while other studies strongly support the effectiveness of olanzapine in the treatment of depressive symptomatology. Olanzapine is associated with significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol and risperidone. In addition, olanzapine is not associated with a risk of agranulocytosis as seen with clozapine or clinically significant hyperprolactinaemia as seen with risperidone or prolongation of the QT interval. The most common adverse effects reported with olanzapine are bodyweight gain, somnolence, dizziness, anticholinergic effects (constipation and dry mouth) and transient asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations. In comparison with haloperidol, the adverse events reported significantly more frequently with olanzapine in > or = 3.5% of patients were dry mouth, bodyweight gain and increased appetite and compared with risperidone, only bodyweight gain occurred significantly more frequently with olanzapine. The high acquisition cost of olanzapine is offset by reductions in other treatment costs (inpatient and/or outpatient services) of schizophrenia. Pharmacoeconomic analyses indicate that olanzapine does not significantly increase, and may even decrease, the overall direct treatment costs of schizophrenia, compared with haloperidol. Compared with risperidone, olanzapine has also been reported to decrease overall treatment costs, despite the several-fold higher daily acquisition cost of the drug. Olanzapine treatment improves quality of life in patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses to a greater extent than haloperidol, and to broadly the same extent as risperidone. Olanzapine demonstrated superior antipsychotic efficacy compared with haloperidol in the treatment of acute phase schizophrenia, and in the treatment of some patients with first-episode or treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The reduced risk of adverse events and therapeutic superiority compared with haloperidol and risperidone in the treatment of negative and depressive symptoms support the choice of olanzapine as a first-line option in the management of schizophrenia in the acute phase and for the maintenance of treatment response.", "outbound_citations": ["12671523", "12452548", "10847307", "11015815", "11227395", "10994377", "11048902", "11030485", "11048906", "10997865", "10906363", "10939309", "10868556", "12413635", "10711911", "10798821", "10738844", "10546082", "16464176", "11117662", "10588425", "9919323", "10553758", "10573326", "10573327", "10553730", "10565806", "10573312", "10549681", "10340685", "10340688", "10340682", "10511917", "10500873", "10482120", "10484969", "10499158", "10479950", "10484968", "10470705", "10470706", "10440469", "10485643", "10450260", "10435202", "10424935", "10505486", "10401467", "10394475", "10424639", "10394486", "10401912", "10366691", "10538333", "10350037", "10372259", "10350036", "10410183", "10422899", "10227113", "10884900", "10327925", "10230177", "10341541", "10369616", "10213477", "10084639", "10030472", "10211140", "9934945", "10051059", "9934952", "10030474", "10071708", "9989565", "10211147", "10537964", "9892264", "10548138", "10500880", "24945060", "10416726", "10507279", "10335666", "10416732", "10416729", "10513458", "9921705", "9921698", "9864084", "9868577", "10084355", "9855322", "9916613", "9846037", "9861575", "9798083", "9821737", "9860152", "9783349", "26971742", "9690709", "9729687", "9714267", "9659857", "10182198", "9659858", "9671347", "9611669", "9619164", "9828990", "9690981", "9793876", "9847049", "9555606", "9541334", "9555605", "9510219", "10178497", "9510228", "9510225", "9690965", "10178499", "9847047", "9551772", "9577836", "9509290", "9519075", "9430133", "18370463", "9533977", "9711381", "9408917", "9408818", "9408810", "9413413", "9505989", "9265916", "9376336", "9265915", "9412161", "9200772", "9833015", "9184614", "9169300", "9090331", "9090332", "9265911", "9028746", "9121724", "9262048", "9010634", "9265918", "9265914", "9406570", "9122367", "9366002", "9090368", "8951954", "8733820", "8866916", "8632334", "8822533", "8822534", "7542676", "7742153", "7840350", "7964671", "7527327", "7908055", "8466541", "1354253", "3046553", "3616518", "9825080", "9701324", "9766619", "8935801", "8935799", "10350045", "11120420", "8935807", "9286184", "7480543", "8935810", "7480537", "8935812", "2695141", "9766620", "9315992", "10401471", "17165324", "7494570", "9356581", "9892301", "8848537", "10474283", "7480523", "11163780", "7544900", "10200755", "10947493", "10172917", "8935797", "9549958", "10360147"], "inbound_citations": ["36263635", "36313772", "36188551", "35879041", "35326094", "34528455", "34335273", "33677821", "33515643", "33289715", "33011546", "32991788", "32250470", "32141723", "32097169", "31584140", "30901117", "30575709", "30348514", "28741044", "28876362", "28109665", "28250568", "27934447", "27081386", "26549190", "26337828", "27240183", "25821032", "25694077", "25728458", "25941630"], "label": "0"}

This article will focus on the use of topiramate for bipolar disorder.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe pharmacological profile of topiramate is compared to other established and putative mood stabilizers, and a rationale for its use in bipolar disorder is presented. Data from open clinical trials of topiramate for depression, mania, and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder are summarized. Preliminary data from one pilot dose-finding, double-blind, random-assignment, placebo-controlled, 3-week parallel group study of two doses of topiramate for acute bipolar I mania is reported. Safety data regarding topiramate was reviewed. Finally, the potential place of this agent in bipolar illness is considered.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe pharmacological advantages for topiramate are low protein binding, minimal hepatic metabolism and mainly unchanged renal excretion, a 24-h half-life, and minimal drug interactions. Open clinical studies suggest a 50-65% response for refractory bipolar mania, and a 40-56% response for refractory bipolar depression in mainly add-on treatment. Open clinical studies of topiramate for rapid-cycling subjects and those for comorbid bulimia, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress, migraine, and obesity report effectiveness. The primary efficacy endpoint data (change from baseline Y-MRS total scores) of the placebo-controlled, random assignment parallel group phase II dose-finding study were not statistically significant. However, once the antidepressant-associated manias (28 of the sample, of 97 subjects) were excluded from the controlled study, the post-hoc analyses indicated the higher dose (512 mg/day) topiramate treatment group showed a statistically significant reduction in endpoint Y-MRS change scores as compared to placebo (p < 0.03). Adverse effects of topiramate in bipolar subjects include attention, concentration and memory problems, fatigue, sedation, transient paraesthesias, nausea, and anorexia. Some subjects experience word-finding difficulty. Weight loss may be seen in several topiramate-treated subjects with bipolar disorder.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTopiramate appears to show promise as an addition to the agents available to treat bipolar disorder. More definitive controlled data on the efficacy of topiramate in the acute and continuation phases as well as for the prophylaxis either as monotherapy or as combination treatment of bipolar disorder are ongoing, and the results are awaited.", "outbound_citations": ["11386499", "11353598", "11249802", "10826666", "10826655", "10862801", "10768300", "10768298", "10768299", "10768295", "10768293", "10768292", "10768302", "10826656", "10826667", "10588422", "10565577", "10509176", "11256656", "10418700", "10360144", "10208444", "10027832", "9932951", "9864077", "9831921", "9858083", "9653709", "9710056", "9692746", "9544331", "9433333", "9405564", "9332882", "9406942", "9300637", "9006394", "8923523", "8641242", "8796355", "8707997", "8647792", "8574989", "8550953", "7883737", "7883742", "7883739", "7804393", "8120960", "8216695", "1543034", "1929761", "2119303", "2165504", "2107762", "2109691", "2794470", "2717658", "2537861", "2561681", "3395263", "3204401", "3319543", "3632397", "3102218", "3766117", "3956451", "6626851", "6421569"], "inbound_citations": ["30041458", "29720037", "28795276", "27978794", "27591453", "27105819", "26375446", "24644505", "22249827", "21498130", "21180413", "19877978", "30282272", "19264273", "19034205", "18218062", "18076372", "17845276", "17880860", "17176493", "17577471", "17384530", "24940728", "19412496", "16934763", "17008822", "16403851", "16437453", "17071548", "16009565", "16194268", "16026484", "15985582", "15826734", "15924583", "15845141", "15746479", "15610953", "15663348", "15619108", "15597132", "15526969", "15107653", "15200741", "15222775", "14978467", "14646607", "14555424", "14971866", "12957718", "12897641", "12892540", "15985931", "12892536", "12567156", "14977464", "16864288", "12630658", "12625992"], "label": "0"}

Risperidone and donepezil are both metabolized through cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4, raising the possibility of drug interactions with combination therapy. The objective of this study was to determine whether significant drug interactions occur with concomitant administration of donepezil and risperidone. In an open\u2010label, three\u2010way crossover study, 24 healthy men were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mg of risperidone twice daily, 5 mg of donepezil once daily, or both drugs for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 21\u2010day washout period. The treatment ratios of AUC and associated 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for risperidone active moiety, defined as risperidone plus 9\u2010hydroxyrisperidone (ratio = 110.2%; 90% CI = 103.7\u2013117.2), and for donepezil (ratio = 97.1%; 90% CI = 90.0\u2013103.6) were within the 80% to 125% of bioequivalence range. The treatment ratios of Cmax and associated 90% CIs for risperidone active moiety (ratio = 114.6%; 90% CI = 107.0\u2013122.8) and for donepezil (ratio = 96.1%; 90% CI = 90.0\u2013102.6) were also within the bioequivalence range. Therefore, no significant pharmacokinetic differences occurred in either risperidone active moiety or donepezil when given alone or in combination. Adverse events (predominantly headache, nervousness, and somnolence) were minor and comparable for all treatment groups. The results indicate that no clinically meaningful drug interactions occurred between risperidone 1 mg daily and donepezil 5 mg daily at steady state, and therefore no dosage adjustment is required when both drugs are combined with the dosage regimen studied. Additional investigations are warranted to determine the potential for interactions in elderly patients with dementia who may eliminate risperidone and donepezil more slowly and thus be more vulnerable to clinical drug interactions than the young healthy subjects examined in this study.", "outbound_citations": ["7531352", "2480616", "11005702", "10939309", "10534086", "10496251", "10440009", "10225124", "10073330", "10084637", "10084417", "10071091", "10048600", "9972387", "9876215", "9988841", "10427352", "9839763", "9839762", "9839765", "9839764", "9839766", "9839761", "9766783", "9853200", "9598283", "9608413", "9581208", "9469266", "9549592", "9248870", "9195280", "9447503", "8934265", "8647794", "9024333", "8535049", "7542676", "7544547", "7507814", "1400751", "1379482", "1701262", "7114305"], "inbound_citations": ["33352242", "30372021", "29025271", "27718745", "32263485"], "label": "0"}

Methods In a prospective, randomised, double-blind study, 44 patients scheduled for elective intraocular surgery received either 0.15 mg clonidine (n=22) or a matched placebo (n=22) orally 60 minutes before retrobulbar anesthesia. The main study parameters were sedation, anxiolysis, hemodynamics and intraocular pressure. Additionally, mediators of endocrine stress responses were measured five times, in 13 patients after clonidine and 12 after placebo. Results After clonidine 86% of the patients showed sedation and after placebo 90.9% showed no sedation (p<0.01). Clonidine produced effective anxiolysis (Erlanger-Anxiety-Scale: 31.6 \u00b1 2.6 points vs. 38.1 \u00b1 8.5 points) before the operation (p<0.01). Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower after clonidine. Effects on mean and diastolic blood pressure were small but statistically significant. Norepinephrine and cortisole plasma concentrations were significantly lower after clonidine. Intraocular pressure was significantly lower too (p<0.05). No clinically relevant adverse effects were observed e.g. inappropriate sedation, hypotension (<100 mmHg), bradycardia (<50 bpm) or hypoxemia (SpO2<90%). Conclusions Oral low-dose clonidine produces light sedation, significant anxiolysis and stable hemodynamics, and attenuates the endocrine response to perioperative stress. Thus, clonidine seems sufficient to increase patient comfort for intraocular surgery and might even offer clinically worthwhile benefits such as stable hemodynamics and a reduced response to perioperative stress.", "outbound_citations": ["9891896", "9495395", "9542559", "9243225", "9088819", "9004342", "8831304", "7978438", "8250311", "8480899", "7682905", "1549937", "1887969", "1859765", "1878231", "2248839", "3285731", "3281701", "3690838", "3434164", "3668841", "3496811", "2455170", "3830368"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Clonidine-containing local anesthetic solutions have better analgesic properties than plain solutions when used for spinal, epidural, or peripheral blocks. We tested the hypothesis that the addition of clonidine may improve the quality of IV regional anesthesia, especially tourniquet tolerance. Forty patients were allocated randomly in a double-blinded, randomized study to receive 40 mL of 0.5% lidocaine and either 1 mL of isotonic saline or clonidine (150 microg). A double-cuffed tourniquet was kept inflated until patients complained of pain, leading to release of the distal cuff. Pain at the tourniquet site, at the surgical site, and in the distal part of the arm was rated on a visual analog scale (VAS) and a verbal rating scale (VRS) every 15 min during tourniquet placement and every 15 min for 1 h after tourniquet deflation. Motor blockade, sedation, arterial pressure, and heart rate were also recorded. VAS and VRS scores were significantly lower in the clonidine group 30 and 45 min after tourniquet inflation. The tolerance for the distal tourniquet was also significantly longer in the clonidine group (median [range]: 22 [10-40] vs 10 [5-20] min; P < 0.05); motor blockade was comparable between the two groups. Pain was not different in the two groups after tourniquet release. The clonidine group experienced a higher degree of sedation.

Subjects were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale on a weekly basis for 16 weeks.

The two groups were compared for changes in total BPRS and BPRS factor scores. In terms of total BPRS scores, we expected a difference between the two groups because they were categorized based on changes in their CGI scores. However, the total BPRS scores in improvers showed a significant decrease by week 6 of clozapine treatment. On analyzing the four BPRS factors, the improvers showed improvement in the thinking disturbance factor by week 1 that remained steady from week 7. On the hostility-suspiciousness factor, the improvers showed an improvement across time when compared with nonimprovers. The withdrawal-retardation factor showed improvement in both groups across time, whereas the anxiety-depression factor was least influenced by clozapine.

Sixteen also received pemoline as part of a subsequent open trial. Stepwise linear regressions determined significant predictors of drug response. Our prior report of a positive significant correlation between CSF homovanillic acid (HVA) and ratings of hyperactivity on placebo was replicated in a new sample of 20 boys. After baseline symptom severity, CSF HVA was the best predictor of stimulant drug response, with significant independent contribution to four of the ten measures of hyperactivity that changed significantly with medication.

The first group (N = 52) was treated with Beck's model of CBT, whereas the second group (N = 23) received randomized but open-label treatment with either fluoxetine (N = 10) or bupropion (N = 13). Crossover to the alternate medication was permitted after 8 weeks of treatment for antidepressant nonresponders. The patient groups were well matched prior to treatment. Outcomes included remission and nonresponse rates, as well as both independent clinical evaluations and self-reported measures of depressive symptoms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDespite limited statistical power to detect differences between treatments, depressed men treated with pharmacotherapy had significantly greater improvements on 4 of 6 continuous dependent measures and a significantly lower rate of nonresponse (i.e., 13% vs. 46%). The difference favoring pharmacotherapy was late-emerging and partially explained by crossing over nonresponders to the alternate medication. The advantage of pharmacotherapy over CBT also tended to be larger among the subgroup of patients with chronic depression.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nResults of prior research comparing pharmacotherapy and CBT may have been influenced by the composition of study groups, particularly the gender composition, the choice of antidepressant comparators, or an interaction of these factors. Prospective studies utilizing flexible dosing of modern antidepressants and, if necessary, sequential trials of dissimilar medications are needed to confirm these findings.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["27694550", "25961373"], "label": "0"}

At low doses, it enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission by preferentially blocking presynaptic dopamine D2/D3 autoreceptors. At higher doses, amisupride antagonises postsynaptic dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, preferentially in the limbic system rather than the striatum, thereby reducing dopaminergic transmission. In patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia, the recommended dosage of amisulpride is 400 to 800 mg/day, although dosages < or =1200 mg/day may be administered. In comparative trials, amisulpride administered within this range (400 to 1200 mg/day) was as effective as haloperidol 5 to 40 mg/day, flupenthixol 25 mg/day and risperidone 8 mg/day in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia with predominantly positive symptoms. Amisulpride was more effective than haloperidol but equally effective as risperidone in controlling negative symptoms. Amisulpride 400 to 800 mg/day was more effective than haloperidol, risperidone and flupenthixol in controlling affective symptoms in these patients. In randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia, amisulpride 50 to 300 mg/day was more effective than placebo. Amisulpride is effective as maintenance therapy in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Long-term treatment with amisulpride was associated with improvements in quality of life and social functioning. Amisulpride is generally well tolerated. In well-controlled trials, the neurological tolerability profile (including ratings on extrapyramidal symptom scales) of amisulpride 400 to 1200 mg/day was superior to that of the conventional antipsychotics (haloperidol or flupenthixol), but was similar to that of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. At low dosages of amisulpride (< or =300 mg/day), the incidence of adverse events (including extrapyramidal symptoms) reported with amisulpride was similar to that with placebo. In comparative trials, amisulpride 400 to 1200 mg/day showed efficacy in reducing overall symptomatology and positive symptoms similar to that of conventional antipsychotics and newer atypical antipsychotics in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Moreover, its effective alleviation of negative and affective symptoms, its lower association with extrapyramidal symptoms and loss of cognitive function than conventional antipsychotics and its long-term efficacy justifies consideration of the use of higher dosages of amisulpride in this group of patients. Consequently, the dosage of amisulpride that is recommended in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia is 400 to 800 mg/day, although dosages < or =1200 mg/day may be administered. Lower dosages of amisulpride (50 to 300 mg/day) should be considered for the management of patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

Fifty-nine percent fully completed and 36% partially completed follow-up assessments.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive flexibly dosed olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d, with prophylactic benztropine, 1 to 4 mg/d (n = 159); or haloperidol, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 150), for 12 months.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nStandardized measures of symptoms, quality of life, neurocognitive status, and adverse effects of medication. Veterans Affairs administrative data and interviews concerning non-VA service use were used to estimate costs from the perspective of the VA health care system and society as a whole (ie, consumption of all resources on behalf of these patients).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no significant differences between groups in study retention; positive, negative, or total symptoms of schizophrenia; quality of life; or extrapyramidal symptoms. Olanzapine was associated with reduced akathisia in the intention-to-treat analysis (P<.001) and with lower symptoms of tardive dyskinesia in a secondary analysis including only observations during blinded treatment with study drug. Small but significant advantages were also observed on measures of memory and motor function. Olanzapine was also associated with more frequent reports of weight gain and significantly greater VA costs, ranging from 3000 dollars to 9000 dollars annually. Differences in societal costs were somewhat smaller and were not significant.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOlanzapine does not demonstrate advantages compared with haloperidol (in combination with prophylactic benztropine) in compliance, symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, or overall quality of life, and its benefits in reducing akathisia and improving cognition must be balanced with the problems of weight gain and higher cost.", "outbound_citations": ["15846619", "12963676", "12555049", "12908663", "12202454", "12042194", "11925293", "11594896", "11346195", "11242324", "11603883", "11354590", "11099280", "11078035", "11015817", "10993126", "10217380", "9989575", "10537964", "9865219", "9672052", "9659857", "9408917", "9295240", "9169300", "9090331", "8610818", "8822534", "7513599", "2574607", "3616518", "6474101", "6138011", "6120019", "7221835", "4917967"], "inbound_citations": ["37159349", "33812977", "32292463", "31303314", "31343440", "31308636", "32166169", "29980181", "29409162", "28578178", "27318892", "27514296", "27265548", "27247177", "27091214", "27052109", "27016729", "27247842", "27864791"], "label": "0"}

Also, in preclinical studies, the vermis has been shown to modulate forebrain dopamine systems, to influence locomotor activity, and to contain a significant density of dopamine transporters.\n\n\nMETHOD\nT(2) relaxometry was used to indirectly assess blood volume in the cerebellum (hemispheres and midline vermis) of 10 boys with ADHD who were administered placebo or one of three different doses of methylphenidate continuously for 1 week.

To date, such reports are from uncontrolled clinical experience and therefore cannot clarify whether the atypical antipsychotics caused such manic-like states or simply failed to prevent them. Presumably, bipolar patients would be at increased risk for this putative adverse event. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of olanzapine to exacerbate symptoms of mania compared to placebo during treatment of bipolar mania. Two inpatient, double-blind, randomized trials investigating the efficacy of olanzapine 5-20 mg daily versus placebo for the treatment of acute mania were combined. Two hundred and fifty-four subjects participated (placebo n=129; olanzapine n=125) in the two studies. Severity of mania was quantified with the 11-item Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS). In a post-hoc analysis, after double-blind therapy up to 3 weeks, categorical comparison of olanzapine and placebo groups was made for any worsening and worsening by 10 or 20% from baseline Y-MRS scores (LOCF). The percentage of subjects with exacerbation at endpoint were: any worsening, placebo 37.7%, olanzapine 21.8% (P=0.005); >or=10% worsening, placebo 24.6%, olanzapine 14.5% (P=0.039); >or=20% worsening, placebo 15.6%, olanzapine 8.1% (P=0.064). Mania rating scores worsened for some patients during olanzapine therapy. However, this was significantly less common with olanzapine than with placebo. These controlled data suggest that clinical case reports of occurrence of 'mania' during treatment with olanzapine, and possibly those with other atypical antipsychotics, reflect exacerbation in the natural history of bipolar illness, rather than an adverse pharmacological effect.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1966\u2013September 1999), Embase (1980\u2013August 1999), PsycINFO (1887\u2013August 1999), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970\u2013August 1999), and CIANHL databases were searched. References from the selected citations, review articles, and the manufacturer were also screened. STUDY SELECTION: Included studies were randomized, double-blind, controlled trials evaluating bupropion versus SSRIs for depression in adults. Studies were assessed independently in duplicate. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. DATA ANALYSIS: Data are reported as absolute weighted mean differences or relative risks and 95% confidence intervals comparing bupropion relative to SSRIs. Data not combined are presented qualitatively. DATA SYNTHESIS: Six full-length studies were included of 257 citations identified. SSRI comparators were fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine. No differences in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Improvement of Illness (CGI-I) were found, but data were not able to be quantitatively combined. The absolute weighted mean differences were 0.10 (95% CI \u22120.2 to 0.4) for the CGI for Severity of Illness and 0.37 (95% CI \u22120.85 to 1.6) for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety measurements. Relative risks of bupropion compared with SSRIs were 0.6 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.89), 0.31 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.57), and 0.27 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.48) for nausea, diarrhea, and somnolence, respectively. Sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic dysfunction, and sexual desire disorder occurred less with bupropion than with SSRIs, with relative risks of 0.46 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.83), 0.22 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.40), and 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.84), respectively.

However, data on the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents in children are limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of risperidone as compared with placebo for the treatment of autistic disorder accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children 5 to 17 years old. The primary outcome measures were the score on the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the rating on the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I) scale at eight weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 101 children (82 boys and 19 girls; mean [+/-SD] age, 8.8+/-2.7 years) were randomly assigned to receive risperidone (49 children) or placebo (52). Treatment with risperidone for eight weeks (dose range, 0.5 to 3.5 mg per day) resulted in a 56.9 percent reduction in the Irritability score, as compared with a 14.1 percent decrease in the placebo group (P<0.001). The rate of a positive response, defined as at least a 25 percent decrease in the Irritability score and a rating of much improved or very much improved on the CGI-I scale, was 69 percent in the risperidone group (34 of 49 children had a positive response) and 12 percent in the placebo group (6 of 52, P<0.001). Risperidone therapy was associated with an average weight gain of 2.7+/-2.9 kg, as compared with 0.8+/-2.2 kg with placebo (P<0.001). Increased appetite, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, and drooling were more common in the risperidone group than in the placebo group (P<0.05 for each comparison). In two thirds of the children with a positive response to risperidone at eight weeks (23 of 34), the benefit was maintained at six months.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRisperidone was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children with autistic disorder.

As a supplementation to this regimen, the effect of IT clonidine on the duration of analgesic action was investigated. Forty-eight healthy parturients were randomly assigned into three groups to receive 0 microg (group C0), 15 microg (C15) or 30 microg (C30) of clonidine IT in addition to 5 microg sufentanil plus 1.25 mg bupivacaine IT for labour analgesia. The quality of pain relief was assessed on 0-100 visual analogue scale by the author. The occurrence of side effects was also evaluated before the request for additional analgesia. Clonidine (C15 and C30), produced a longer duration of analgesia than C0 (mean 144 +/- sd 27.9, 165 +/- 31.8 vs 111 +/- 21.9 min, P < 0.01). Also, C15 and C30 produced a more rapid onset and a higher quality of analgesia than C0, (P < 0.01). The most cephalad level of sensory block was higher in C30 than C15 (median T3 vs T4, P < 0.05) but lowest in C0 (median T7 vs T3,T4, P < 0.01). Side effects, sedation and hypotension, occurred more frequently in C30 than in either C0 or C 15, (9 vs 2,5 and 9 vs 1,3, respectively, P < 0.05).

Blood pressure and the subjective feeling of sedation were affected equally by clonidine and guanfacine. The 0.5 microgram/kg and 5 micrograms/kg doses of clonidine disrupted spatial working memory, but the medium dose had no effect. The 0.5 and 2 micrograms/kg doses of clonidine increased impulsive responding in the planning test. The 5 micrograms/kg dose of clonidine slowed responding at effortful levels of planning and attentional set-shifting tests. The 29 micrograms/kg dose of guanfacine improved spatial working memory and planning. Guanfacine had no effect on attentional set-shifting. These data indicate that guanfacine improved planning and spatial working memory, but clonidine dose-dependently disrupted performance. It is possible that the greater selectivity of guanfacine for alpha 2A-adrenoceptor subtype may underlie its differences from clonidine.", "outbound_citations": ["9264070", "9083644", "9104600", "8942958", "8904746", "8736565", "8598908", "8714706", "8624188", "8670636", "8670421", "8527807", "7731533", "8519505", "7908883", "8301310", "7953684", "8164514", "7905189", "7905190", "8234565", "8104809", "8371837", "1629849", "1762678", "1686301", "1666366", "2267054", "2903226", "2842764", "2823383", "2999977", "6150001", "112679", "361388", "922502", "330174"], "inbound_citations": ["36078048", "33900871", "33649970", "33075480", "32892961", "31507388", "30255728", "29501506", "30007160", "29878501", "29360949", "29482474", "29436486", "28641496", "28855875", "28483638", "28336568", "28091572", "27329555", "27256296", "26791212", "26585576", "26264904", "25140866", "25481798", "25567555", "25446433", "25242808", "24782714", "24484979", "23164814", "23486878", "23518815", "22735770", "22871915", "22570132", "21926422", "22524369", "22414705", "22015717", "22017969", "22290201", "22234929", "20731476", "22039843", "22013901", "21767584", "21883531", "21557964", "21596055", "21047621", "21489408", "20875636", "21480691", "21302344", "20844478", "20386882", "20925474", "20731965", "20702515", "20652773", "20078461", "19621977", "19463906", "19520360", "20596295", "18295885", "18591484", "18784917", "18631701", "18157465", "17822336", "17448997", "17303246", "16987674", "19300541", "17102702", "16806103", "17101879", "17020482", "17016709", "16855530", "16642355", "16261567", "16278855", "17096085", "16286817", "16078088", "15888511", "15858063", "15916700", "15671125", "15671126", "15548553", "15950011", "16522198", "15207363", "15451380", "15265636", "15221200", "15115947", "14742148", "15063099", "14982243", "14707298", "15205875", "12591093", "15205883", "12469007", "12431863", "12351753", "19810946", "12122489", "12547976", "11732636", "11441427", "11281812", "11811674", "11113036", "10942848", "10986819", "11105647", "10709220", "10516957", "10560028", "10481832", "10426538", "10426537", "21227275", "9566501"], "label": "0"}

Method: This single-center, outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study consisted of two phases. Forty-one nondepressed patients with neuropathic pain spent 6 weeks in each phase in random order and received identical tablets of 150 mg bupropion SR or placebo. Patients were instructed to take one tablet once daily for 1 week followed by one tablet twice daily for 5 weeks. Results: While the patients took bupropion SR, neuropathic pain relief was improved or much improved in 30 (73%) patients, and one of these patients became pain-free. The mean average pain score at baseline was 5.7, which remained unchanged at the end of week 6 with placebo, but decreased by 1.7 points to 4.0 (p < 0.001) during therapy with bupropion SR. Pain relief with bupropion SR was significant at week 2 (p < 0.05) and continued throughout weeks 3 through 6 (p < 0.001). A significant decrease in interference of pain on quality of life was observed while patients were receiving bupropion SR compared with placebo. Side effects experienced with bupropion SR were not dose-limiting and consisted primarily of dry mouth, insomnia, headache, gastrointestinal upset, tremor, constipation, and dizziness. Conclusion: This placebo-controlled crossover trial showed that bupropion SR (150\u2013300 mg daily) was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of neuropathic pain.", "outbound_citations": ["11061244", "10741812", "10371588", "10342407", "9846778", "9846777", "9583761", "9364578", "9040716", "8942124", "8538882", "7665537", "7649968", "7963793", "8169857", "8071306", "1424428", "1535121", "1738571", "1861872", "2147235", "2143820", "2178851", "2436092", "6366276", "6646795", "6126361", "216303", "14077422", "14399272", "13222823"], "inbound_citations": ["37160297", "36543666", "36069935", "37146583", "35271915", "34151765", "32182196", "31917153", "31558312", "31145210", "31359175", "30898855", "29290899", "28411257", "28631805", "28554532", "27932310", "28204956", "27401055", "27853957", "26588213"], "label": "0"}

Main outcomes and results : Laboratory studies show that systemically-administered drugs that affect specific central neurotransmitters including norepinephrine and GABA influence affect recovery in a predictable manner. Although some drugs such as d-amphetamine have the potential to enhance recovery, others such as neuroleptics and other central dopamine receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines and the anti-convulsants phenytoin and phenobarbital may be detrimental. In one study, 72% of patients with traumatic brain injury received one or a combination of the drugs that may impair recovery based on both animal experiments and studies in recovering stroke patients. Conclusions : Until the true impact of these classes of drugs are better understood, care should be exercised in the use of medications that may interfere with the recovery process in patients with traumatic brain injury. Additional research needs to be completed before the clinical efficacy of drugs that may enhance recovery can be established.", "outbound_citations": ["2172841", "3936085", "11564483", "11546902", "10699450", "10528358", "9804653", "9749682", "9440425", "9408227", "21551528", "8685930", "7491646", "7608684", "7746398", "7938134", "8173966", "1282014", "1435438", "1387033", "21551648", "21551653", "1686846", "21551632", "1978424", "2121803", "1979521", "2166617", "2339141", "2306622", "2237973", "21551572", "2803549", "2680078", "2736072", "2734319", "2765187", "2845578", "3179833", "3228817", "3051045", "3345072", "3060211", "3543216", "3107904", "3780914", "3729755", "3742206", "3719374", "4084800", "4041836", "2996303", "3966865", "6091272", "6744050", "6722561", "6141377", "6633868", "6311879", "6824527", "7133350", "7100929", "7145094", "7104688", "7117309", "7470936", "581877", "21357", "1262859", "1055379", "4698424", "5667068", "13935311"], "inbound_citations": ["30980836", "26711850", "26153729"], "label": "0"}

Partly as a result of this, other atypicals have recently been evaluated as treatments for refractory schizophrenia. In order to evaluate the evidence base relating to the drug treatment of refractory schizophrenia, we developed a refractoriness rating based on previous work. Using this rating, we assessed all trials of atypicals in schizophrenia unresponsive to at least one drug. Overall, clozapine was consistently shown to be effective in refractory schizophrenia, even when stringently defined. Data relating to olanzapine and risperidone are equivocal at best, and there is some evidence to suggest that they are less effective than clozapine. There is essentially no cogent evidence to support the use of any other atypical in refractory schizophrenia.

CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old white man without past or family history of diabetes mellitus presented with DKA after eight months of clozapine therapy (50 mg twice daily). After treatment of DKA and discontinuation of clozapine, glucose tolerance and concurrent serum insulin concentrations reverted to normal as measured by two OGTT performed 60 and 320 days after resolution of DKA. DISCUSSION: Antiislet-cell antibodies, antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, and human insulin antibody were negative on two separate occasions. Euglycemic clamp study demonstrated insulin resistance manifested by a glucose disposal rate of approximately 55% of mean normal values. IVGTT demonstrated a low rate of glucose disappearance (KG = 0.95) and diminished first-phase insulin response when OGTT was normal, indicating impairment in insulin sensitivity and reduction in \u03b2 cell function 323 days after discontinuance of clozapine. This adverse reaction is considered probable according to the Naranjo probability scale. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of cases of DKA and new or worsening diabetes mellitus in patients using clozapine suggests a causal relationship. We hypothesize that the mechanism by which clozapine may produce glucose intolerance may require a preexisting latent defect in insulin secretion and insulin action. With the administration of clozapine, some of these patients may develop worsening insulin resistance and may fail to mount an appropriate compensatory \u03b2 cell insulin secretion for the degree of insulin resistance. As a consequence, hyperglycemia develops and its persistence results in glucose toxicity, further suppressing \u03b2 cell insulin secretion. Such combined defects in insulin secretion and sensitivity are known to be synergistic, leading to the development of abnormal glucose tolerance, which can be clinically manifested as a spectrum ranging from impaired glucose tolerance through severe hyperglycemia to DKA. Patients being started on clozapine should be carefully followed for the development or worsening of diabetes mellitus, regardless of the dose of the drug.", "outbound_citations": ["10831479", "29590823", "10197898", "10333925", "10079027", "9798083", "9715376", "9926128", "9671341", "9718630", "9328511", "9108812", "9046936", "8889915", "8633697", "8740397", "8739670", "8780446", "8092346", "8067501", "1629073", "1425483", "1728188", "2684710", "3894969", "6356930", "6614168", "382871", "443421", "13833973"], "inbound_citations": ["29855416", "28816925", "28636569", "27888379"], "label": "0"}
