Hypoglycemia associated with sertraline and coadministration of oral hypoglycemics belonging to the sulphonylurea derivatives has rarely been reported. A patient with schizoaffective disorder with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) treated with sertraline, risperidone and glyburide who developed hypoglycemia is presented. The article highlights that inhibition of P450 enzymes can be affected by several different factors. Interactions are possible whenever a patient concomitantly receives two drugs that bind to the same P450 system Greater inhibition was likely induced at doses higher than those recommended. This process was reversed within 10 days of discontinuing the sertraline. Good glycemic control followed discontinuation of psychotropic drugs and the oral hypoglycemic agent. Knowledge of the individual P450 enzymes is important in the metabolism of individual drugs, together with an understanding of the patient's drug metabolizing ability. These factors may lead to more appropriate prescribing and further research into specific P450 enzymes responsible for metabolism of particular drugs, which remains unclear.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34872936"], "label": "0"}

Pharmacokinetic differences between the various sulphonylureas are of clinical importance in terms of the time to onset of action, timing of drug administration in relation to food intake, magnitude and duration of the glucose-lowering effect and the risk of serious hypoglycaemia. Recent studies with improved analytical sensitivity have shown that the elimination half-life of glibenclamide is longer than previously thought and that 2 metabolites of glibenclamide have significant hypoglycaemic activity. Furthermore, single dose studies in healthy volunteers using an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model have identified clear concentration-effect relationships for both glibenclamide and its metabolites after oral and intravenous administration. Under multiple dose conditions, kinetic-dynamic relations have been identified with shorter-acting drugs in dosages that give discontinuous sulphonylurea exposure. However, at continuous exposure, i.e. sustained 24-hour therapeutic concentrations in plasma, there is evidence indicating the development of tolerance, which may be caused by downregulation of beta cell sensitivity. As more sophisticated concentration-effect studies appear, it has become evident that currently recommended maximum daily doses of many sulphonylureas are too high.", "outbound_citations": ["9551701", "9143783", "9146849", "8576296", "7648827", "8529506", "7988301", "8137685", "8494353", "1678270", "1907291", "2567896", "3117609", "3533680", "6487509", "6487510", "6433769", "7116738", "620227", "3123184", "7047168", "6804245", "6767639", "8877293", "7988624", "7002565", "8417634", "3065086"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Advanced glycation end products, glycoxidised and oxidized low-density lipoproteins and reactive oxygen species linked to hyperglycemia have all been identified in type 2 diabetes mellitus and could accelerate macroangiopathy. Hence, the resistance to insulin is an additional independent risk factor, in association with oxidant stress, dyslipidemias, and prothrombic/hypofibrinolytic states. The endothelium is a major organ involved by cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, inflammation, ageing, postmenopausal status, and smoking. Changes in endothelium function may lead to the coronary artery circulation being unable to cope with the increased metabolism of myocardial muscle independently of a reduced coronary artery diameter. The way endothelial function is altered in diabetic patients is not yet fully understood, but the loss of normal endothelial function could be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic angiopathy, as endothelial dysfunction is associated with diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy.

Glycosylation of LDL leads to decreased interaction with its normal receptors, and glycosylation of lens proteins and tendon collagen may play a role in altered crosslinking and inhibition of normal turnover, leading to cataracts and arthropathy. Of relevance to diabetic nephropathy, glycosylated endothelial basement membrane proteins are chemotactic for macrophages, and the presence of such proteins leads to increased cytokine and growth factor release, as well as increased endothelial permeability and altered nitric oxide metabolism. Aminoguanidine, developed by Cerami, is a small (Mr 110) molecule that reacts with the precursor Amadori product and AGEs, preventing further glycosylation and abnormal crosslinking, independently of the level of glycemic control. Aminoguanidine has been shown in animal studies to prevent collagen cross-linking, decrease the number of acellular capillaries and microaneurisms in the retina, prevent cataract formation, decrease glomerular basement membrane thickening, prevent mesangial expansion, and decrease proteinuria. In animal studies, aminoguanidine has also been shown to have beneficial effects on atherogenesis. Rodby pointed out that much of the work in this area has been done by one group of researchers, now at the Alteon company, so that confirmation by other groups is necessary. Alteon holds patent rights to aminoguanidine, which is being developed under the name \"pimagedine\" as a treatment for diabetic complications and for various age-related diseases and conditions. Rodby discussed the particular burden seen in people with diabetes who have renal failure, which is accompanied by decreased clearance as well as increased production of AGEs. He mentioned nephropathy studies being sponsored by Alteon with Marion Merill Dow that are now in progress and may show an important role of aminoguanidine in the prevention of complications in patients with renal failure. Five clinical trials are currently under way in which aminoguanidine is being evaluated in patients with type I diabetes, in patients with type II diabetes, and in diabetic patients on hemodialysis. These studies include two pivotal phase III clinical trials being conducted at more than 100 North American clinical sites. In addition, Alteon is pursuing indications that aminoguanidine may be useful for the treatment of stroke, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain skin conditions and is investigating possible applications in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Rodby mentioned the interesting chemical similarity of metformin and aminoguanidine. In addition to its glycemic effects, some of the benefit of metformin in diabetes may be by indirect mechanisms in which it mimics effects of aminoguanidine.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Patients were treated for 8 to 23 days with a mean amount of 0.50 +/- 0.02 IU/kg/day. Glycaemic control was very good after 3-5 days of CSII and remained good at T3. At T2, fasting and postprandial plasma C peptide levels decreased significantly. At T3, fasting C peptide was very similar to T1, and postprandial C peptide was significantly higher than at T1. The molar fasting and postprandial plasma C peptide/glycaemia ratios increased significantly at T3. After glucagon injection, the molar delta C peptide/glycaemia ratio was significantly increased at T2 and even higher at T3. At T2, as at T1 and T3, there were significant correlations between fasting and postprandial C peptide levels and between the glucagon-induced C peptide peak and fasting and postprandial C peptide levels. Between T1 and T3 weight changes correlated significantly with the molar fasting C peptide/glycaemia ratio at T1. Twenty-nine of the 30 patients for whom this ratio was > 6.6 x 10(-8) lost weight. The length of CSII treatment did not correlate with weight changes or other biological parameters. This study shows that CSII with moderate amounts of insulin associated with a low-calorie diet and metformin provided rapid glycaemic control, led to weight loss, maintained regulation of insulin secretion and seemed to improve insulin secretion and sensitivity.

In part, this delay in initiating treatment is due to a fear of provoking hypoglycaemia, which in itself results from a general avoidance of blood glucose monitoring on the part of patients. As a consequence of this apparent disregard for diabetes care, blood glucose concentrations are not adequately controlled in the US and this is reflected in a high incidence of chronic complications, particularly diabetic neuropathy. This is likely to have major cost implications in the future. In an effort to improve the standard of diabetes care, a number of US authorities have begun producing guidelines for primary care physicians, and in the State of Texas, treatment algorithms that incorporate recommendations based on the current US registration trial data have been developed. These recommendations, which have now been adopted by the State of Texas and form part of the minimum standard of care mandated by the State Department of Health's Diabetes Council, provide guidance on the selection and use of oral antidiabetic drugs (including sulphonylureas, metformin, troglitazone, repaglinide and acarbose) in patients with type 2 diabetes, both for glycaemic control and for prevention of cardiovascular complications.

Today, intensified insulin therapy represents the optimal standard of insulin replacement. It permits meal-oriented injection of normal insulin and the use of longer-acting insulin overnight. This form of treatment is now facilitated by the possibilities of plasma glucose selfmonitoring and the use of injection aids (pen). Intensified treatment should be initiated at the time type I diabetes is diagnosed. In the case of a particularly instable metabolic situation or neuropathy, it may become necessary to use insulin pumps.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

As ATP-sensitive K+ channels appear to be a mediator of ischaemic preconditioning in both experimental and clinical studies, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of K(ATP) channels in the warm-up phenomenon.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nTwenty-six patients with coronary artery disease were randomized to receive 10 mg oral glibenclamide, a selective ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, or placebo. Sixty minutes after glibenclamide or placebo administration, patients were given an infusion of 10% dextrose (8 ml x min(-1)) to correct glucose plasma levels or, respectively, an infusion of saline at the same infusion rate. Thirty minutes after the beginning of the infusions, both patient groups underwent two consecutive treadmill exercise tests, with a recovery period of 15 min to re-establish baseline conditions. Before exercise tests, blood glucose levels were similar in placebo and glibenclamide groups (96 +/- 10 vs 105 +/- 22 mg x 100 ml(-1), P=ns). After placebo administration, rate-pressure product at 1.5 mm ST-segment depression significantly increased during the second exercise test compared to the first (220 +/- 41 vs 186 +/- 29 beats x min(-1) x mmHg x 10(2), P<0.01), but it did not change after glibenclamide (191 +/- 34 vs 187 +/- 42 beats x min(-1) x mmHg x 10(2), P=ns), with a significant drug-test interaction (P=0.0091, at two-way ANOVA).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGlibenclamide, at a dose previously shown to abolish ischaemic preconditioning during coronary angioplasty, prevents the increase of ischaemic threshold observed during the second of two sequential exercise tests.

Method The specific P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of rosiglitazone were determined by a combination of three approaches; multiple regression analysis of the rates of metabolism of rosiglitazone in human liver microsomes against selective P450 substrates, the effect of selective chemical inhibitors on rosiglitazone metabolism and the capability of expressed P450 enzymes to mediate the major metabolic routes of rosiglitazone metabolism. Result The major products of metabolism following incubation of rosiglitazone with human liver microsomes were para-hydroxy and N-desmethyl rosiglitazone. The rate of formation varied over 38-fold in the 47 human livers investigated and correlated with paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylation (P<0.001). Formation of these metabolites was inhibited significantly (>50%) by 13-cis retinoic acid, a CYP2C8 inhibitor, but not by furafylline, quinidine or ketoconazole. In addition, both metabolites were produced by microsomes derived from a cell line transfected with human CYP2C8 cDNA. There was some evidence for CYP2C9 playing a minor role in the metabolism of rosiglitazone. Sulphaphenazole caused limited inhibition (<30%) of both pathways in human liver microsomes and microsomes from cells transfected with CYP2C9 cDNA were able to mediate the metabolism of rosiglitazone, in particular the N-demethylation pathway, albeit at a much slower rate than CYP2C8. Rosiglitazone caused moderate inhibition of paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylase activity (CYP2C8; IC50=18 microm ), weak inhibition of tolbutamide hydroxylase activity (CYP2C9; IC50=50 microm ), but caused no marked inhibition of the other cytochrome P450 activities investigated (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A and 4A). Conclusion CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the hydroxylation and N-demethylation of rosiglitazone in human liver; with minor contributions from CYP2C9.", "outbound_citations": ["10189256", "8759326", "8810033", "7473140", "7618352", "8553685", "7923194", "7696540", "7975717", "7903909", "8215410", "8424795", "1371482", "1930304", "1889415", "1680620", "1981707", "2378786", "2322567", "2299601", "2565211", "2916844", "3171974", "3052575", "3203057", "3355588", "4096368", "3843705", "3063497", "PMC1380167", "PMC1132200", "PMC1386495", "9740537"], "inbound_citations": ["36678526", "36813636", "36170034", "35777846", "35621148", "33944982", "33613018", "32290339", "30783475", "29901213"], "label": "0"}

The concept that a feedback loop governs the interaction of the insulin-sensitive tissues and the beta cell as well as the elucidation of the hyperbolic relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion explains why insulin-resistant subjects exhibit markedly increased insulin responses while those who are insulin-sensitive have low responses. Consideration of this hyperbolic relationship has helped identify the critical role of beta-cell dysfunction in the development of Type 2 diabetes and the demonstration of reduced beta-cell function in high risk subjects. Furthermore, assessments in a number of ethnic groups emphasise that beta-cell function is a major determinant of oral glucose tolerance in subjects with normal and reduced glucose tolerance and that in all populations the progression from normal to impaired glucose tolerance and subsequently to Type 2 diabetes is associated with declining insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function. The genetic and molecular basis for these reductions in insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function are not fully understood but it does seem that body-fat distribution and especially intra-abdominal fat are major determinants of insulin resistance while reductions in beta-cell mass contribute to beta-cell dysfunction. Based on our greater understanding of the relative roles of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in Type 2 diabetes, we can anticipate advances in the identification of genes contributing to the development of the disease as well as approaches to the treatment and prevention of Type 2 diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["8877295", "8582538", "1778354", "2065848", "2198187", "2668077",

STUDY SELECTION: Selection of prospective epidemiologic and clinical studies were limited to those focusing on the management of type 2 diabetes. All articles with pertinent information relevant to the scope of this article were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes differ; however, both share chronic complications that significantly affect morbidity and mortality. People with type 1 diabetes have an absolute deficiency of insulin, whereas people with type 2 diabetes have varying degrees of insulin resistance and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) has clearly indicated that intense control of blood glucose in type 1 diabetes prevents and slows the progression of microvascular (i.e., retinopathy, nephropathy) and neuropathic complications. The Kumamoto study showed similar results in nonobese patients with type 2 diabetes. Intense insulin therapy in both populations has proven advantageous, thus supporting a common pathophysiologic process for the microvascular and neuropathic complications. Trends were seen toward fewer macrovascular (atherosclerotic disease) complications in the intensive insulin arm of the DCCT. Conversely, trends were seen toward an increase in macrovascular complications in the VA Cooperative study in people with type 2 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy. This may suggest a discordance in the pathophysiology of macrovascular disease between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, it remains uncertain whether tight glycemic control prevents the onset or slows the progression of macrovascular disease. Two studies (the University Group Diabetes Program and the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study on Glycemic Control and Complications in Type 2 Diabetes) to date have examined pharmacotherapy options for patients with type 2 diabetes and resultant macrovascular complications. It has yet to be determined whether any therapeutic intervention will decrease the morbidity and mortality of macrovascular disease in this population. CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetes, limited prospective evidence does support tight glycemic control to help prevent or slow the progression of microvascular and neuropathic complications. It is uncertain whether tight glycemic control decreases macrovascular complications and which pharmacotherapeutic agent(s) is/are the best options. However, therapy that improves glucose control in combination with aggressive risk factor management should be initiated and enforced in patients with type 2 diabetes in an effort to reduce long-term complications.", "outbound_citations": ["10189558", "12502625", "12502626", "9167103", "9009975", "8971078", "8971080", "8596596", "8742574", "12502616", "8554214", "7623902", "7587846", "7700316", "7732997", "8307622", "8304914", "8357128", "8432214", "8419716", "1284141", "1600834", "1954808", "1864219", "1936481", "2338751", "2301354", "2694775", "2643000", "2662932", "3277013", "3069769", "3792230", "3907294", "6853663", "6759206", "6757026", "7267029", "520119", "520116", "199096", "4266466", "4926376"], "inbound_citations": ["35496279", "27468331", "23440669", "21919543", "19552750", "18766296", "18374119"], "label": "0"}

Both epidemiological and prospective data have demonstrated that treatment of hyperglycaemia is markedly effective in reducing the risk of microvascular disease but is less potent in reducing that of myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors, although by definition less prevalent than hyperglycaemia, appears to be more effective in preventing macrovascular disease than treatment of hyperglycaemia. In recent years, data from intervention trials have suggested that greater benefits with respect to the prevention of macrovascular disease can be achieved by effective treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, and by the use of small doses of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) than by treating hyperglycaemia alone. On the other hand, the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), which examined the impact of intensive glucose and blood pressure (BP) control on micro- and macrovascular complications, is the only intervention trial to include only patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The UKPDS data, the epidemic increase in the number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and their high cardiovascular risk have, however, initiated several new trials addressing, in particular, the possible benefits of treatment of the most common form of dyslipidaemia (high serum triglyceride and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels) in these patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is thus a disease associated with a high vascular risk, where the majority of patients need, and are likely to benefit from, pharmacological treatment of several cardiovascular risk factors provided treatment targets have not been achieved by life-style modification.", "outbound_citations": ["8786010", "6825976", "6131004", "10639539", "10639540", "10418858", "10357573", "10331395", "10189532", "10189534", "10068412", "10227567", "10030325", "9870835", "9841303", "9820979", "9732338", "9742977", "9635947", "9613910", "9609084", "9662040", "9662052", "9571349", "9549452", "9538975", "12017680", "9498659", "9416888", "9355893", "9315531", "9198234", "9223402", "9169397", "9096989", "9385294", "8968014", "8908388", "8657237", "8677862", "7589828", "7587918", "7722129", "7729308", "8076658", "7903784", "8359108", "8387089", "8432214", "1507375", "3313041", "3817306", "9843456", "9742976", "10053176", "9673301", "9538988", "8298418", "9486993", "2664509"], "inbound_citations": ["32035523", "30783461", "30181696", "26426468", "25103217", "25332812", "22279598", "15733008", "12790691", "15516153", "21453018", "22052198", "20705869", "20369451"], "label": "1"}

The Pima Indians arrived in the Americas from Asia around 30,000 years ago. The Pima had little contact with the Spanish and were not in contact with settlers of European origin until the 1840s. In the early 1960s it was realized that the population had an 8to 10fold increased risk of diabetes in comparison to that of the general U.S. population. Although full data are not available, it seems likely that in the early 1900s diabetes was rare in the Pima and that even as recently as the 1920s it was less common than in the general population. Early studies showed that glucose levels were bimodally distributed in the Pima, allowing the definition of specific diagnostic criteria that have been used in our current definitions of normal, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and type II diabetes. Incidence studies showed that diabetes aggregates in families and that obesity is a major risk factor. Bennett presented data that show that natives of Neruda, in the Pacific, also have an extremely high rate of diabetes. The common denominator between Pimas and Nerudans appears to be obesity. Nerudans have much higher rates of diabetes than natives of less affluent Pacific Islands. Similarly, the incidence of diabetes is lower among Pima Indians living in Mexico, who have increased physical activity and decreased obesity, and physical activity levels among the Arizona Pima are inversely related to the prevalence of diabetes. Offspring of women with diabetes during pregnancy have a much higher incidence of diabetes than offspring of women who subsequently develop diabetes but did not have diabetes during pregnancy, suggesting that there is an influence of the intrauterine environment. Breast feeding for at least 2 months lowers the rate of development of diabetes. Pima women who have never been pregnant have a twofold increased risk of developing diabetes, as do women who have had irregular menses. The \"thrifty genotype hypothesis\" is that nutritional deprivation in utero causes increased rates of developing diabetes. Bennett showed a U-shaped curve that showed increased levels of diabetes in adult life in both low-birth-weight and high-birth-weight infants. The highbirth-weight infants are the classic infants of gestational diabetic pregnancies; the low-birth-weight babies may survive because there is a selective advantage to having this genotype. Metabolic determinants of diabetes in the Pima include the increased incidence of diabetes found with increased fasting insulin levels. Early studies showed the importance of insulin resistance. With the use of indirect calorimetry it was found that insulin resistance was due primarily to resistance to glucose storage rather than to glucose oxidation. Those individuals with insulin resistance and decreased insulin secretion had the highest rates of", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

The glycemic response to each of the progressive, sequential phases of insulin treatment was assessed, along with the incidence of hypoglycemic reactions and the relative efficacy of different doses of glipizide in combination with fixed doses of insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Five medical centers participated; half of the patients were assigned to the intensive treatment arm aiming for normal HbA1c levels. Age of patients was 60 \u00b1 6 years, duration of diabetes 8 \u00b1 3 years, and BMI 30.7 \u00b1 4 kg/m2. A fourstep management technique was used, with patients moving to the next step if the operational goals were not met: Phase I, evening intermediate or long-acting insulin; phase II, added daytime glipizide; phase III, two injections of insulin alone; and phase IV multiple daily insulin injections. Home glucose monitoring measurements were done twice daily and at 3:00 A.M. once a week. Hypoglycemic reactions and home glucose monitoring results were recorded and counted in each of the treatment phases. RESULTS Baseline HbA1c was 9.3 \u00b1 1.8%, and fasting plus serum glucose was 11.4 \u00b1 3.3 mmol/1. Fasting serum glucose fell to near normal in phase I, and remained so in the other treatment phases. An HbA1c separation of 2.1% between the arms was maintained during the course of the study, while the intensive arm kept HbA1c levels below 7.3% (P = 0.001). Most of the decrease in HbA1c occurred with one injection of insulin alone (phase I, \u2212 1.4%) or adding daytime glipizide (phase II, \u22121.9% compared with baseline). HbA1c did not decrease further after substituting two injections of insulin alone, with twice the insulin dose. Multiple daily injections resulted in an additional HbA1c fall (\u22122.4% compared with baseline). However, two-thirds of the patients were still on one or two injections a day at the end of the study Changes in home glucose monitoring levels paralleled those of the HbA1c, as did the increments in number of reported hypoglycemic reactions, virtually all either \u201cmild\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d in character. For the combination of glipizide and insulin (phase II), the only significant effect was obtained with daily doses up to 10 mg a day; there were no significant additional benefits with up to fourfold higher daily doses, and HbA1c levels had an upward trend with doses >20 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS A simple regime of a single injection of insulin, alone or with glipizide, seemed sufficient to obtain clinically acceptable levels of HbA1c for most obese, insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes patients. Further decrease of HbA1c demanded multiple daily injections at the expense of doubling the insulin dose and the rate of hypoglycemic events. In combination therapy, doses of glipizide >20 mg/day offered no additional benefit.", "outbound_citations": ["9009975", "8799649", "7587846", "7833731", "8299463", "8366922", "8357128", "8325203", "1406860", "2276309", "6629834"], "inbound_citations": ["36718676", "32738493", "31157748", "30121746", "30246878"], "label": "1"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Fifty-three Chinese patients with NIDDM (mean age 53.9 \u00b1 12.6 years, duration of diabetes 9.0 \u00b1 4.9 years, body wt 60.4 \u00b1 13.3 kg with corresponding body mass index 24.2 \u00b1 4.3 kg/m2, receiving the maximum dose of sulfonylurea and/or metformin) were confirmed to have OHA failure. Twenty-seven patients were randomized to continue OHAs and were given additional bedtime insulin (combination group); 26 patients were randomized to insulin therapy alone with twice\u2013daily insulin (insulin group). Insulin doses were increased incrementally, aiming at fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <7.8 mmol/l during a stabilization period of up to 8 weeks. Insulin dosage, body weight, glycemie control, and quality of life were assessed before and at 3 and 6 months after stabilization. RESULTS Both groups showed similar improvement of glycemie control. For the combination group, FPG decreased from 13.5 \u00b1 2.7 to 8.9 \u00b1 3.0 mmol/l at 3 months (P < 0.0001) and to 8.6 \u00b1 2.5 mmol/l at 6 months (P < 0.0001). For the insulin group, FPG decreased from 13.5 \u00b1 3.6 to 7.5 \u00b1 3.0 mmol/l at 3 months (P < 0.0001) and to 9.8 \u00b1 3.5 mmol/l at 6 months (P < 0.0001). No significant differences were observed between the groups. Similarly, both groups had significant improvement of fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc). Fructosamine fell from a mean of 458 to 365 \u03bcmol/l at 3 months (P < 0.0001) and to 371 \u03bcmol/l at 6 months (P < 0.0001) and from 484 to 325 \u03bcmol/1 at 3 months (P < 0.0001) and to 350 \u03bcmol/l at 6 months (P < 0.0001) for the combination and insulin groups, respectively. HbA1cdecreased from 10.2 to 8.4% at 3 months (P < 0.0001) and to 8.7% at 6 months (P < 0.0001) in the combination group and from 10.7 to 7.8% at 3 months (P < 0.0001) and to 8.4% at 6 months (P < 0.0001) in the insulin group. Despite similar improvement of glycemia, insulin requirements were very different. At 3 months, the combination group was receiving a mean of 14.4 U/day compared with 57.5 U/day in the insulin group (P < 0.0001). Similar findings were observed at 6 months (15.0 vs. 57.2 U/day, P < 0.0001). Both groups gained weight. However, for the combination group, weight gain was 1.6 \u00b1 1.8 kg at 3 months and 2.1 \u00b1 2.5 kg at 6 months (both P < 0.0001 vs. baseline), whereas for the insulin group, weight gain was 3.5 \u00b1 4.3 and 5.2 \u00b14.1 kg, respectively (both P < 0.0001 vs. baseline). Weight gain was significantly greater in the insulin group (P < 0.05 at 3 months, and P < 0.005 at 6 months). Fasting plasma triglyceride decreased in the insulin group (1.8 \u00b1 1.0 to 1.4 \u00b1 0.8 mmol/l at 3 months [P < 0.005] and to 1.4 \u00b1 0.7 mmol/l at 6 months [P < 0.02]) but not in the combination group. No changes were observed in total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. No severe Hypoglycemic reactions were recorded in either group. Mild reactions occurred with similar frequency in both groups. Well-being and quality of life improved significantly in both groups. The majority of patients (82.7%) wanted to continue insulin beyond 6 months, irrespective of the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS in NIDDM patients with secondary OHA failure, therapy with a combination of OHAs and insulin and with insulin alone was equally effective and well tolerated. However, combination therapy was associated with a lower insulin dose and less weight gain. Combination treatment may be considered when OHA failure occurs as a potential intermediate stage before full insulin replacement.", "outbound_citations": ["8253025", "8325203", "8497435", "1406860", "1425085", "1387073", "1556522", "1828656", "2192852", "2192850", "2182032", "2664520", "2757059", "2499443", "3126626", "3283552", "3279941", "3277013", "3521280", "3516096", "3516607", "6382897", "6376030", "7287908", "13766421"], "inbound_citations": ["36686585", "33311036", "30008760", "27640062", "25590212", "24614911", "23659564", "22470171", "15200348", "21900381", "21067837", "20642370", "20831529", "20393934", "19876795", "19421967", "9389427", "18248491", "18363534", "18154689", "18157921", "17976204", "17445933", "17466560", "17881330", "17682113", "17566010", "17403121", "17330687", "17142216", "16351770"], "label": "0"}

Troglitazone acts by enhancing the effects of insulin at peripheral target sites and, unlike the sulphonylurea drugs, is not associated with hypoglycaemia when administered as monotherapy. Clinical trials with troglitazone (usually 200 to 600 mg/day) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus consistently showed marked improvement in glycaemic control, as well as reductions in fasting serum insulin, C-peptide and triglyceride levels. Comparative studies with either glibenclamide (glyburide) or metformin indicated similar glycaemic control with troglitazone or these agents. Serum insulin levels were lower with troglitazone than with glibenclamide. Clinical trials of up to approximately 2 years' duration showed that glycaemic control is maintained with troglitazone on a long term basis. In general, troglitazone is well tolerated by the majority of patients. However, discontinuation of troglitazone because of elevated liver enzyme levels occurs in approximately 2% of patients receiving the drug, and frequent monitoring of liver enzymes is required (e.g. at least 11 times during the first year of therapy). Among patients who started troglitazone therapy in 1998 (after the incorporation of a boxed warning and increased monitoring requirements in the product labelling), the estimated risk of liver-related death is approximately 1 in 100,000. Troglitazone improves the ability of target cells to respond to insulin. The drug has been shown to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin, and its efficacy is similar to that of glibenclamide or metformin. Although troglitazone is generally well tolerated, close monitoring of liver enzyme function is required to minimise the rare occurrence of serious hepatic dysfunction. Drug acquisition and liver function monitoring costs, as well as potential adverse effects, are important factors that may ultimately determine the precise place of troglitazone in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, as the first member of a new class of oral antidiabetic agents, the thiazolidinediones, troglitazone offers an effective treatment option in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus through its action of improving insulin sensitivity.", "outbound_citations": ["10496299", "9867776", "9855455", "9811416", "9727891", "9745421", "9737807", "9727892", "9753210", "9753209", "9789718", "9701278", "9625027", "9606460", "9589243", "9589670", "9568715", "9667800", "9694545", "9516221", "9516220", "9506734", "9533065", "9454525", "9549650", "9421387", "9568716", "9489591", "9489592", "9416885", "9506006", "9421284", "9356012", "9347245", "9290544", "9349604", "9284856", "9253306", "9250469", "9196046", "9186311", "9150855", "9099123", "9054771", "9118772", "9049476", "8996411", "8740931", "8922349", "8972242", "8866563", "8828476", "8784087", "8691897", "8596596", "9162613", "9162604", "8576907", "8718436", "8554203", "8786734", "7476339", "8575720", "7666790", "8581792", "7729620", "7780577", "7723671", "7895657", "7794582", "7616365", "10158995", "7958495", "7935656", "7955995", "7988348", "7920888", "29817821", "1450495", "1547676", "1797492", "2227113", "2590599", "2758951", "3053303", "3060188", "7380107", "9032099", "9211083", "9832300", "9164446", "9742977", "9742976", "8899798", "9215280", "8781766", "8941474", "9422509", "8366922", "1943750", "9742972", "7768881", "3056758", "351218"], "inbound_citations": ["32374857", "31783317", "29609830"], "label": "0"}

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and heterogeneous metabolic disorder that often requires multiple therapeutic approaches to achieve adequate metabolic control. Furthermore, the incidence of T2DM is increasing and affects almost one-third of the older population in the United States. Several new classes of drugs to treat T2DM have become available over past 5 to 8 years. In addition, the goals of therapy (target hemoglobin (Hb)A 1c and fasting and postprandial glucose levels) have become progressively more stringent as evidence mounts regarding the benefits of glucose control in the prevention of diabetic microvascular complications. Most patients with T2DM will ultimately require treatment with combination oral therapy or insulin to reach glucose control targets. There are unique features of diabetes mellitus (DM) in older populations that need to be considered when choosing a therapeutic agent. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was performed to identify all English-language reports of unique, randomized, controlled clinical trials involving recently available oral agents for T2DM. Bibliographies were also reviewed to find additional reports not otherwise identified. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were included in the analysis if they had a study period of at least 3 months, if each group contained at least 10 subjects at the study\u2019s conclusion, and if HbA 1c was reported. When multiple dosages of a drug were tested, the results of the highest approved dosage were used. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were collected from 63 published randomized controlled trials, including placebocontrolled monotherapy trials, monotherapy \u201chead to head\u201d comparisons, and combination therapy trials. In placebo-controlled trials, HbA 1c data were presented as the difference between the change in treated versus placebo subjects. Evidence of efficacy in lowering glucose concentrations and effectiveness in preventing diabetic complications was reviewed.", "outbound_citations": ["12502614", "12028227", "10868827", "10466662", "2721345"], "inbound_citations": ["30658463", "24092493", "21880627", "18236732"], "label": "0"}

Other agents improve insulin secretion kinetics. This is the case for repaglinide et nateglinide, which are efficient in controlling postprandial blood glucose, and to a lesser degree, fasting blood glucose. These agents shortly and quickly stimulate insulin secretion and should be available soon. In oral therapy secondary failures, trials are currently being conducted to clarify the role of fast-acting insulin analogs, as monotherapy or in combination. Finally, insulin sensitizing agents are being investigated as a way to improve postprandial glucose efflux by potentiating insulin effects.

This phenomenon may be deleterious for the preservation of residual beta cell function in patients with slowly progressing type 1 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adult (LADA). Aim/hypothesis: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the exclusion of glibenclamide in the treatment of ICA positive type 2 diabetic patients may diminish or halt the humoral autoimmune response against B-cells as well as improve metabolic control and insulin secretion. Subjects and methods: Fourteen type 2 diabetic patients with pancreatic autoimmunity (ICA+ and GABA+) and treated with insulin and glibenclamide (duration of disease 2.0 - 2.2, range 0.1-7 years and age 53 - 12.5, range 36-75 years) were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, Group 1: insulin monotherapy (n = 8, age 53 - 6.4 years) (Exclusion of glibenclamide) and, Group 2: insulin plus glibenclamide (n = 6, age 53.5 - 16.9 ) (Unmodified treatment). Both groups were investigated at the beginning of the study and after one year for the following parameters: ICA and anti-GAD65 antibodies, fasting glucose and fasting C-peptide. Results: In group 1, six out of eight patients became ICA negative while all patients in group 2 remained ICA positive (p = 0.0097). Fasting glucose concentrations improved in group 1 (4.6 - 2.8) in relation to group 2 (11.5 - 5.5, p = 0.0023) after one year of treatment. No differences were found for anti-GAD antibodies and fasting C-Peptide between the groups. Conclusions: These data show that exclusion of glibenclamide in the treatment of ICA+ type 2 diabetic patients partially decreases specific autoimmunity against endocrine pancreatic cells and improves metabolic control. This may reflect decreased expression of B-cell autoantigens suggesting that insulin monotherapy is a better choice for the treatment of LADA.", "outbound_citations": ["8063033", "3545954", "6360778", "11473087", "9892237", "9972673", "9726590", "9556356", "9115573", "8621013", "8582122", "8098691", "8096268", "2197139", "2644534", "2680555", "3275559", "3545950", "3510930", "6145046", "332567"], "inbound_citations": ["37120620", "33682984", "31449359"], "label": "0"}

Because a normal pattern of insulin secretion is essential for the effective control of postprandial metabolism, a rational basis for the development of agents that target early-phase insulin release exists. Conventional oral hypoglycaemic agents do not target, or adequately control, postprandial glycaemia. The emergence of new classes of oral agent with a more specific mode of action provides, for the first time, an opportunity to restore early-phase insulin release. One such drug class is the meglitinide analogues (repaglinide, nateglinide, and mitiglinide). These drugs are ideally suited for combination use with metformin. They could also prove effective in combination with a thiazolidinedione, a drug class that targets insulin resistance. Exogenous insulin is frequently required in the late management of type 2 diabetes.

(2) The reference first-line drug therapy for type 2 diabetes, when drug therapy is needed, is single-agent treatment with metformin (a biguanide) for overweight patients, or with glibenclamide (a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea) for other patients. (3) If monotherapy fails to control blood glucose levels adequately, most clinical guidelines then recommend a combination of metformin with a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea, although the few available comparative clinical data raise the possibility of excess mortality with this treatment. (4) Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone (glitazones that reduce insulin resistance) have been authorized in the European Union for combination with a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea (for patients in whom metformin is ineffective or poorly tolerated) or with metformin (for obese patients). (5) None of the available trials of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone include data on mortality or morbidity. (6) There are fewer data on pioglitazone than on rosiglitazone. (7) According to short-term comparative trials, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are more effective than placebo on blood glucose levels. Combinations of rosiglitazone or pioglitazone with metformin or with glucose-lowering sulphonylureas have not been compared with the metformin + glucose-lowering sulphonylurea combination or with insulin. (8) Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone frequently cause weight gain. (9) Pioglitazone has a slightly favourable effect on lipid profiles, unlike rosiglitazone, which increases LDL-cholesterol levels. (10) The main side effect of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone is sodium and water retention, which can provoke oedema, anaemia (by haemodilution), and even heart failure. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are also hepatotoxic. (11) Combining rosiglitazone with insulin is contraindicated, owing to the increased risk of heart failure. The same applies to pioglitazone. (12) In practice, neither rosiglitazone nor pioglitazone has a place in the management of type 2 diabetes, except in the context of strictly controlled long-term comparative clinical trials.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

A literature-based, decision-tree model was developed to project the number of patients achieving glycosylated haemoglobin values of <7% on oral therapies and the associated costs over a 3-year timeframe. For each first-line strategy, patients could progress to combination therapy using two or more agents prior to the introduction of insulin. The overall cost of treatment included costs (2001/2002 values; US dollars) of comprehensive medical care, laboratory tests, patient education, drug therapy, home glucose monitoring and adverse events. At 3 years, the overall cost of treatment for the various first-line strategies was 6,106 US dollars for glipizide gastrointestinal therapeutic system, 6,727 US dollars for metformin immediate release, 6,826 US dollars for metformin extended release, 7,141 US dollars for glibenclamide (glyburide)/metformin, 7,759 US dollars for rosiglitazone and 9,298 US dollars for repaglinide. Costs of comprehensive routine medical care ranged from approximately 1,538-2,128 US dollars in year 1 and from approximately 952-1,543 US dollars in subsequent years, for controlled and uncontrolled patients, respectively. Adverse events represented <1%, and drug therapies represented approximately 50%, of the overall cost, respectively. Substantial cost differences between the strategies were seen within the first year.

Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests (FSIGTs) were conducted on Latino women with impaired glucose tolerance and a history of gestational diabetes before and after 12 weeks of treatment with 400 mg/day troglitazone (n = 13) or placebo (n = 12). Insulin sensitivity was assessed by minimal model analysis, and beta-cell insulin release was assessed as acute insulin responses to glucose (AIRg) and tolbutamide (AIRt) during FSIGTs and as the 30-min incremental insulin response (30-min dINS) during OGTTs. Beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance was assessed as the product (disposition index) of minimal model insulin sensitivity and each of the 3 measures of beta-cell insulin release. In the placebo group, there was no significant change in insulin sensitivity or in any measure of insulin release, beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance, or glucose tolerance. Troglitazone treatment resulted in a significant increase in insulin sensitivity, as reported previously. In response, AIRg did not change significantly, so that the disposition index for AIRg increased significantly from baseline (P = 0.004) and compared with placebo (P = 0.02). AIRt (P = 0.001) and 30-min dINS (P = 0.02) fell with improved insulin sensitivity during troglitazone treatment, so that the disposition index for each of these measures of beta-cell function did not change significantly from baseline (P > 0.20) or compared with placebo (P > 0.3). Minimal model analysis revealed that 89% of the change from baseline in insulin sensitivity during troglitazone treatment was accounted for by lowered plasma insulin concentrations. Neither oral nor intravenous glucose tolerance changed significantly from baseline or compared with placebo during troglitazone treatment. The predominant response of beta-cells to improved insulin sensitivity in women at high risk for type 2 diabetes was a reduction in insulin release to maintain nearly constant glucose tolerance.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33098240", "32930949", "32191646", "31241742", "29618726"], "label": "0"}

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of nateglinide and metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA total of 12 type 2 diabetic subjects with the following baseline characteristics were enrolled: age, 56 +/- 13 years; BMI, 28.7 +/- 4.5 kg/m2; HbA1c, 8.4 +/- 1.3%; and fasting plasma glucose 13 +/- 2.8 mmol/l. All subjects had been previously treated with glyburide and were switched to metformin monotherapy for 3 weeks before study start. Subjects then randomly received, in combination with 500 mg metformin, either 120 mg nateglinide or placebo before meals for 1 day, followed by the alternate treatment 7 days later. After 1 week of washout from both drugs, subjects received 1 day of open-label nateglinide treatment. Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, nateglinide, and metformin were assessed frequently during inpatient periods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPostmeal plasma glucose levels were significantly lower in subjects treated with nateglinide plus metformin than in those treated with either drug alone (P < 0.001), especially after lunch and dinner. Coadministration of nateglinide and metformin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug. All treatments were safe and well tolerated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCombination therapy with nateglinide and metformin was more effective than either treatment alone and did not result in any pharmacokinetic interactions. Coadministration of nateglinide and metformin appears to be an excellent option for treating patients with type 2 diabetes not controlled with monotherapy.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

We compared the efficacy and safety of glargine (a long-acting insulin analog) and NPH insulins in insulin-naive type 2 diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nThere were 426 type 2 diabetic patients (age 59 +/- 9 years, BMI 28.9 +/- 4.3 kg/m2, mean +/- SD) with poor glycemic control on oral antidiabetic agents randomized to treatment for 1 year with bedtime insulin glargine or bedtime NPH insulin. Oral agents were continued unchanged. The fasting blood glucose (FBG) target was 6.7 mmol/l (120 mg/dl).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAverage glycemic control improved similarly with both insulins (HbA(1c), [reference range <6.5%] 8.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 8.2 +/- 0.1% at 1 year, glargine vs. NPH, mean +/- SEM, P < 0.001 vs. baseline for both). However, there was less nocturnal hypoglycemia (9.9 vs. 24.0% of all patients, glargine vs. NPH, P < 0.001) and lower post-dinner glucose concentrations (9.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 10.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, P < 0.02) with insulin glargine than with NPH. Insulin doses and weight gain were comparable. In patients reaching target FBG, HbA(1c) averaged 7.7 and 7.6% in the glargine and NPH groups at 1 year.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUse of insulin glargine compared with NPH is associated with less nocturnal hypoglycemia and lower post-dinner glucose levels. These data are consistent with peakless and longer duration of action of insulin glargine compared with NPH. Achievement of acceptable average glucose control requires titration of the insulin dose to an FBG target < or =6.7 mmol/l. These data support use of insulin glargine instead of NPH in insulin combination regimens in type 2 diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["10525654", "10068412", "9653594", "8941458", "7555472", "8366922", "1387073", "1828656", "6376015", "580135"], "inbound_citations": ["37088916", "37038616", "36321411", "36483894", "36271431", "35768707", "35183458", "35036430", "35165557", "34599695", "34525888", "33887352", "33166419", "32532635", "32704570", "32431110", "31997036", "31890395", "31020538", "30641166", "30771017", "30604091", "30658518", "30116732", "29979295", "29802638", "29873004", "29654514", "29650116", "29569978", "28334539", "29276400", "29192764", "28921900"], "label": "0"}

Clinical trials assessing effects on lipids and lipoproteins, and adverse effects of marketed lipid\u2010lowering agents were extracted. Reviews and other relevant articles were included if they provided information regarding lipid and lipoprotein metabolism or guidelines on the treatment of dyslipidemias in patients with diabetes mellitus. An extensive review of clofibrate was not included. The most common dyslipidemia in patients with poorly controlled insulin\u2010dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is combined elevated triglyceride and cholesterol levels, with reduced high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (mixed hyperlipidemia). Hypertriglyceridemia combined with a reduced HDL cholesterol is the most common dyslipidemia in patients with noninsulin\u2010dependent diabetes mellitus, but essentially any pattern of dyslipidemia may be present. Small and dense low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL), glycosylation of lipoproteins, and increased oxidized lipoproteins may be present in patients with diabetes mellitus; all contribute to accelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Insulin therapy generally corrects quantitative lipid abnormalities in patients with IDDM, so drug treatment is seldom indicated. Diet, exercise, and insulin or oral sulfonylureas will improve hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL concentrations, but do not always return them to normal. Drug therapy is indicated when nonpharmacologic measures are inadequate. It is administered based on the effects of each agent on lipids and lipoproteins, patient age, adverse effect profile, patient tolerability, and drug\u2010disease and drug\u2010drug interactions. A fibric acid derivative is the drug of choice for marked hypertriglyceridemia in patients with diabetes mellitus. Niacin can worsen glycemic control, but it may be required in severe hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, or mixed hyperlipidemia. Bile\u2010acid binding resins may accentuate hypertriglyceridemia but may be useful in selected patients with marked hypercholesterolemia and normal triglycerides. Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are preferred in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol and mild hypertriglyceridemia.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study, 132 patients with NIDDM received daily doses of 5, 20, or 40 mg of either glipizide-GITS or immediate-release glipizide for 8 weeks followed by 8 weeks of the alternate formulation. Plasma glucose, serum insulin, C-peptide, and plasma glipizide levels were measured at fasting and post-Sustacal challenge at the end of 1 and 8 weeks of each treatment phase. HbA1c was measured at the end of weeks 7 and 8 of each treatment phase. RESULTS Both formulations of glipizide yielded similar mean HbA1c values. However, mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were significantly lower with glipizide-GITS treatment than with immediate-release glipizide at the end of week 1 (11.0 vs. 11.6 mmol/l; P < 0.01) and at the end of the 8-week treatment phase (10.9 vs. 11.7 mmol/l; P < 0.001). Fasting insulin and C-peptide levels were lower after 5 mg glipizide-GITS vs. immediate-release glipizide. Glucose responses to Sustacal were similar after both formulations of glipizide; however, serum insulin (P < 0.01) and C-peptide responses (P < 0.05) were lower with glipizide-GITS than with immediate-release glipizide treatment at the end of the 8-week treatment phase. Mean plasma glipizide concentrations were stable by the end of week 1, and the concentrations increased proportionately with dose. Once-daily Glipizide-GITS provided effective mean glipizide concentrations (> 50 ng/ml) 24 h after dosing, even at the lowest (5 mg) dose level. Both formulations were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS Glipizide-GITS was significantly more effective than immediate-release glipizide in reducing FPG levels. Both formulations reduced postprandial plasma glucose levels equally; however, glipizide-GITS exerted its control in the presence of lower plasma glipizide concentrations in addition to significantly lower insulin and C-peptide levels. This suggests that glipizide-GITS improves insulin sensitivity.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35602882", "32026779"], "label": "1"}

Design: Multicentre, randomised, controlled trial allocating patients to treatment with diet alone or additional chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, insulin, or metformin (if obese) to achieve fasting plasma glucose concentrations </=6 mmol/l. Setting: Outpatient diabetic clinics in 15 British hospitals. Subjects: 2520 subjects who, after a three month dietary run in period, had fasting plasma glucose concentrations of 6.1-14.9 mmol/l but no hyperglycaemic symptoms. Main outcome measures: Fasting plasma glucose, glycated haemoglobin, and fasting plasma insulin concentrations; body weight; compliance; and hypoglycaemia. Results: Median fasting plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower at three years in patients allocated to chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin rather than diet alone (7.0, 7.6, 7.4, and 9.0 mmol/l respectively; P<0.001) with lower mean glycated haemoglobin values (6.8%, 6.9%, 7.0%, and 7.6% respectively; P<0.001). Mean body weight increased significantly with chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, and insulin but not diet (by 3.5, 4.8, 4.8, and 1.7 kg; P<0.001). A similar pattern was seen for mean fasting plasma insulin concentration (by 0.9, 1.2, 2.4, and \u22120.1 mU/l; P<0.001). In obese subjects metformin was as effective as the other drugs with no change in mean body weight and significant reduction in mean fasting plasma insulin concentration (\u22122.5 mU/l; P<0.001).

Furthermore, we showed that obese normoglycemic family members of a type 2 diabetic proband failed to compensate for the insulin resistance of obesity by increasing insulin secretion. In this study, we tested the primary hypotheses that previously described variants in the pancreatic sulfonylurea receptor gene (SUR1 or ABCC8), glucokinase (GCK) gene, or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (TCF1 or HNF1alpha) gene contribute to the inherited deficiencies of insulin secretion and beta-cell compensation to insulin resistance, as well as the secondary hypotheses that these variants altered insulin sensitivity.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe typed 124 nondiabetic members of 26 familial type 2 diabetic kindreds who had undergone tolbutamide-modified intravenous glucose tolerance tests for two variants of the ABCC8 (sulfonylurea) gene, two variants of the GCK gene, and one common amino acid variant in the TCF1 (HNF1alpha) gene. All family members were classified as normal or having impaired glucose tolerance based on oral glucose tolerance testing. We used minimal model analysis to calculate the insulin sensitivity index (S1) and glucose effectiveness (SG), and acute insulin response to glucose was calculated as the mean insulin excursion above baseline during the first 10 min after the glucose bolus. Disposition index (DI), a measure of beta-cell compensation for insulin sensitivity, was calculated as insulin sensitivity times acute insulin response. Effects of polymorphisms were determined using mixed effects models that incorporated family membership and by a likelihood analysis that accounted for family structure through polygenic inheritance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAn intronic variant of the ABCC8 gene just upstream of exon 16 was a significant determinant of both DI and an analogous index based on acute insulin response to tolbutamide. Surprisingly, heterozygous individuals showed the lowest indexes, whereas the DI in the two homozygous states did not differ significantly. Neither the exon 18 variant nor the variants in the GCK and TCF1 genes were significant in this model. However, combined genotypes of ABCC8 exon 16 and 18 variants again significantly predicted both indexes of glucose and tolbutamide-stimulated insulin secretion. Unexpectedly, a variant in the 3' untranslated region of the GCK gene interacted significantly with BMI to predict insulin sensitivity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe exon 16 variant of the ABCC8 gene reduced beta-cell compensation to the decreased insulin sensitivity in the heterozygous state. This may explain the observation from several groups of an association of the ABCC8 variants in diabetes and is consistent with other studies showing a role of ABCC8 variants in pancreatic beta-cell function. However, our study focused on individuals from relatively few families. Ascertainment bias, family structure, and other interacting genes might have influenced our unexpected result. Additional studies are needed to replicate our observed deficit in beta-cell compensation in individuals heterozygous for ABCC8 variants. Likewise, the role of the GCK 3' variant in the reduced insulin sensitivity of obesity will require further study.", "outbound_citations": ["11017071", "10819247", "10330363", "10333056", "10199785", "10051618", "9851800", "9758619", "9799081", "9653619", "9568693", "9519757", "9133564", "9075812", "9042926", "9032110", "8945470", "8866553", "8842605", "8640221", "8635661", "8616883", "8644748", "8593945", "7657027", "7668272", "7677151", "8247074", "8433729", "1607068", "3311855", "3023430", "3640682"], "inbound_citations": ["32961860", "30515958"], "label": "0"}

Interaction of adenine nucleotides with Kir6.2 positively charged amino acids such as K185 and R201 on the C-terminus causes channel closure. Substitution of these amino acids with other positively charged residues had small effects on inhibition by adenine nucleotide, while substitution with neutral or negative residues had major effects, suggesting electrostatic interactions between Kir6.2 positive charges and adenine nucleotide negative phosphate groups. Furthermore, R201 mutation decreased channel sensitivity to ATP, ADP, and AMP to a similar extent, but K185 mutation decreased primarily ATP and ADP sensitivity, leaving the AMP sensitivity relatively unaffected. Thus, channel inhibition by ATP may involve interaction of the alpha-phosphate with R201 and interaction of the beta-phosphate with K185. In addition, decreased open probability due to rundown or sulfonylureas caused an increase in ATP sensitivity in the K185 mutant, but not in the R201 mutant. Thus, the beta-phosphate may bind in a state-independent fashion to K185 to destabilize channel openings, while R201 interacts with the alpha-phosphate to stabilize a channel closed configuration. Substitution of R192 on the C-terminus and R50 on the N-terminus with different charged residues also affected ATP sensitivity.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 201 patients in 18 centers in 4 countries were randomized in a double-blind manner to miglitol (50 mg t.i.d., followed by 100 mg t.i.d.), glibenclamide (3.5 mg q.d/b.i.d.), or placebo for 24 weeks. Efficacy criteria were changes from baseline of HbA1c, fasting and postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels, body weight, and serum triglycerides. RESULTS Efficacy was assessed in 119 patients who completed the full protocol, and the results were similar to those obtained in 186 patients who fulfilled the validity criteria for analysis. Compared with placebo, mean baseline-adjusted HbA1c decreased by 0.75% (P = 0.0021) and 1.01% (P = 0.0001) in the miglitol and glibenclamide treatment groups, respectively. Blood glucose decreased slightly in the fasting state and considerably in the postprandial state in both treatment groups but not in the placebo group. Fasting insulin levels increased slightly (NS) in all treatment groups; however, postprandial insulin levels decreased with miglitol, while increasing markedly with glibenclamide (P = 0.0001 between all treatment groups). Gastrointestinal side effects (flatulence and diarrhea) occurred mostly in the miglitol-treated patients, while some glibenclamide-treated patients had symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS Miglitol monotherapy is effective and safe in NIDDM patients. Compared with glibenclamide, it reduced HbA1c less effectively and caused more gastrointestinal side effects. On the other hand, glibenclamide, unlike miglitol, tended to cause hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and weight gain, which are not desirable in patients with NIDDM.", "outbound_citations": ["7556806", "7833731", "8039603", "8001622", "8052342", "8112185", "8366905", "8366922", "1499461", "1954810", "2223417", "2673693", "4039692", "6629834", "4181737"], "inbound_citations": ["33897622", "33190640", "32549177", "31333110", "28685995"], "label": "1"}

The aim of this study is to examine whether sulphonylurea drug treatment revives PDH activity in circulating lymphocytes from NIDDM patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty normal-weight individuals with NIDDM were enrolled in this study. They had maintained their glycaemic levels close to normal by means of a restricted diet that had no longer been successful in the proceeding 2 months. The treatment protocol consisted in 160 mg gliclazide daily for 5 weeks. Twenty healthy subjects, matched for age, body mass index and gender, were enrolled as a control group. Patients, before and after treatment, as well as controls were tested for PDH activity in their circulating lymphocytes. Nine other untreated patients and nine healthy subjects, with the above mentioned characteristics, were recruited for the assay of PDH activity in their circulating lymphocytes before and after exposure, in vitro, to gliclazide, to insulin, and to gliclazide and insulin in combination.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn gliclazide-treated NIDDM patients, PDH activity in circulating lymphocytes recovered. In vitro, in circulating lymphocytes of untreated patients and controls insulin at 5 microU ml(-1) was ineffective and highly effective, respectively, in raising enzyme activity; gliclazide at 10 ng ml(-1) was ineffective on PDH in both groups, but in combination with insulin at 5 microU ml(-1) in both groups PDH was as active as in cells of controls exposed to insulin only. In cells of controls, gliclazide alone at 25-50 ng ml(-1) caused enzyme activation, whereas above 50 ng ml(-1) it caused inhibition; in cells of patients below 50 ng ml(-1) it had no effects, but at 50 ng ml(-1) and above raised enzyme activity to the basal level of controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study suggests that free gliclazide concentrations determine recovery of PDH activity in circulating lymphocytes of treated patients through drug-mediated enhanced insulin control over PDH or through the drug alone.", "outbound_citations": ["7750476", "7833497", "7704761", "8243832", "7678737", "1446795", "1637336", "1318688", "1587397", "1592161", "1559409", "2123890", "18411111", "2184057", "2677730", "2504569", "2664520", "3277539", "3073980", "3053285", "3094377", "3026348", "3026347", "3527808", "6368153", "6338572", "6293549", "7048309", "7000069", "6772676", "6249805", "6254825", "505013", "187955", "825112", "136249", "6018", "5036975", "5036972", "4326833", "PMC371691", "6428844", "1451945", "PMC1132197", "PMC329837", "PMC1172695", "PMC1163960", "2668078", "PMC1147101", "PMC1132807", "510803", "PMC346451", "2137771", "1906024", "2559864"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

The compounds will probably exhibit beneficial effects on other facets of the metabolic syndrome. Their effectiveness on glycaemic control appears comparable, as assessed by the literature available. HbA1c is lowered by 1.0 to 1.5%. Both drugs are approved for combination therapy with either metformin or sulphonylureas, not as monotherapy or in combination with insulin.

It is administered once daily to patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in whom glycaemia is not controlled by diet and exercise alone, and may be combined with insulin in patients with secondary sulphonylurea failure. The greatest blood glucose lowering effects of glimepiride occur in the first 4 hours after the dose. Glimepiride has fewer and less severe effects on cardiovascular variables than glibenclamide (glyburide). Pharmacokinetics are mainly unaltered in elderly patients or those with renal or liver disease. Few drug interactions with glimepiride have been documented. In patients with type 2 diabetes, glimepiride has an effective dosage range of 0.5 to 8 mg/day, although there is little difference in efficacy between dosages of 4 and 8 mg/day. Glimepiride was similar in efficacy to glibenclamide and glipizide in 1-year studies. However, glimepiride appears to reduce blood glucose more rapidly than glipizide over the first few weeks of treatment. Glimepiride and gliclazide were compared in patients with good glycaemic control at baseline in a 14-week study that noted no differences between their effects. Glimepiride plus insulin was as effective as insulin plus placebo in helping patients with secondary sulphonylurea failure to reach a fasting blood glucose target level of < or = 7.8 mmol/L, although lower insulin dosages and more rapid effects on glycaemia were seen with glimepiride. Although glimepiride monotherapy was generally well tolerated, hypoglycaemia occurred in 10 to 20% of patients treated for < or = 1 year and > or = 50% of patients receiving concomitant insulin for 6 months. Pooled clinical trial data suggest that glimepiride may have a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than glibenclamide, particularly in the first month of treatment. Dosage is usually started at 1 mg/day, titrated to glycaemic control at 1- to 2-week intervals to a usual dosage range of 1 to 4 mg/day (maximum 6 mg/day in the UK or 8 mg/day in the US). Glimepiride is a conveniently administered alternative to other sulphonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not well controlled by diet alone. Its possible tolerability advantages and use in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs require further study. Glimepiride is also reported to reduce exogenous insulin requirements in patients with secondary sulphonylurea failure when administered in combination with insulin.", "outbound_citations": ["8960852", "8572835", "8911979", "8911987", "8911978", "8529504", "8137714", "1930290", "8777281", "8842603", "7833494", "8911988", "8902432", "1600834", "12369756", "8377160", "7972332", "8911977", "8840133", "8093111", "9203460", "7750476", "8911985", "9184703", "8243832", "8172913", "8911975", "8216442", "8911976", "12369757", "8529503", "8877293", "2361988", "8911984", "8311478", "8911991", "1608924", "9223393", "8911982", "8529486", "8908379", "7972319", "1610416", "8141820", "8172912", "8911981"], "inbound_citations": ["36928591", "36902257", "35642661", "35402293", "33604051", "31640214", "30998259"], "label": "1"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A crossover design with a 15-day intervention diet was used. Eighteen patients were separated into two groups on the basis of hypoglycemic treatment (diet, n = 9, or diet plus glibenclamide, n = 9) and were assigned to a 15-day treatment with a high-carbohydrate/low-fiber diet containing 60% energy from carbohydrate and 20% from fat or a low-carbohydrate/low-fiber diet with 40% energy from carbohydrate and 40% from fat and then crossed over to the other diet for 15 more days. RESULTS The high-carbohydrate diet produced a significant increase in postprandial blood glucose in patients on glibenclamide (13.6 \u00b1 1.4 vs. 11.0 \u00b1 1.8 mmol/l, P < 0.002, while no difference was recorded in the group on diet alone (9.7 \u00b1 vs. 8.9 \u00b1 0.6 mmol/l).

In 10 patients with NIDDM receiving glibenclamide (CAS 10238-21-8) the fasting plasma amylin level was twofold higher than in healthy control (2.72 \u00b1, 0.38 pmol/l; p < 0.025) but following glucagon administration it increased only twofold. In 15 patients treated with metformin (CAS 657-24-9) the fasting plasma amylin level was similar to that in healthy individuals (1.64 \u00b1 0.25 pmol/l), but after glucagon stimulation the increment of plasma amylin was minima1 and the relevant mean value was significantly lower when compared with those in healthy individuals and with NIDDM patients treated with glibenclamide. In 10 untreated obese patients with newly diagnosed NIDDM the administration of glibenclamide (14 days) resulted in the increase of basal (2.47 \u00b1 0.23 and 3.16 \u00b1 0.29 pmol/l; p < 0. l), and glucagon stimulated (3.34 \u00b1 0.39 and 4.56 \u00b1 0.38; p < 0.05) plasma amylin concentrations, whereas other 10 patients receiving metformin showed a decrease in fasting plasma level of this peptide before (2.64 \u00b1 0.59 and 1.28 \u00b1 0.38 pmol/l; p < 0. l), and after glucagon injection (5.02 \u00b1 0.55 and 2.83 \u00b1 0.65 pmol/l; p < 0.02). With the respect to the trophic effect of amyloid deposits in the pancreatic islets and to a hypothetic effect of amylin increasing insulin resistance, the present results emphasize the particular usefulness of metformin in the pharmacological treatment of NIDDM. All contraindications and side effects of metformin should be taken into account before drug administration.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["30449203"], "label": "0"}

In this study, the effect of combination therapy with insulin and glibenclamide on metabolic control, daily insulin dosage, and insulin sensitivity was assessed in subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Ten men with Type 1 diabetes mellitus participated in a randomized, double\u2010blind, crossover, clinical trial with three treatment regimens, namely (1) insulin alone, (2) insulin and placebo, (3) insulin and glibenclamide, each lasting 3 months. Combination therapy induced: (1) reduction in daily insulin dosage; (2) more uniform blood glucose control as reflected by a lower average 24 h blood glucose level, a smaller difference between mean preprandial and 2 h postprandial blood glucose concentrations, decreased 24 h urine glucose excretion, and a decline in number of hypoglycaemic events; (3) improved insulin sensitivity as expressed by more rapid plasma glucose disappearance rate, without a significant alteration in fasting plasma glucagon and 1 h postprandial serum C\u2010peptide levels; when compared with treatment with either insulin alone or with insulin and placebo. Therefore, it is apparent that the addition of glibenclamide to insulin reduces daily insulin dosage and renders a greater uniformity to diurnal blood glucose control, most probably secondary to enhancement of insulin sensitivity.", "outbound_citations": ["8366922", "8147960", "1406860", "1547684", "1828239", "2276309", "2192850", "2192848", "2137755", "2405235", "2136557", "2507265", "2646537", "2645308", "3141099", "3041937", "3282148", "3117833", "2887735", "3299096", "3555432", "3519484", "3902422", "3924948", "3884667", "6398258", "6435371", "6428843", "7009267", "6776759", "106617", "396109", "365478", "192617", "4181737", "5763664", "14241221"], "inbound_citations": ["35745754", "34833980", "23494446"], "label": "0"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Twenty-five moderately obese subjects with NIDDM were randomized to treatment with extended-release glipizide or placebo. After 9 weeks of treatment, they fasted overnight, took their study drug, omitted breakfast, and exercised on a treadmill for 90 min. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations were measured before, during, and after exercise. RESULTS On the fasting-exercise day, fasting glucose concentrations were lower (153 vs. 241 mg/dl, P < 0.01) and insulin and C-peptide concentrations higher in the extended-release glipizide group. The decrement of glucose from the fasting baseline was modest and equivalent in the two groups: 17 vs. 21 mg/dl at the end of exercise and 28 vs. 27 mg/dl after 2 h of recovery.

Levels of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fructosamine, and plasma lipids were measured at predetermined intervals, and the effects of nateglinide on prandial glucose insulin, C-peptide, and triglyceride levels were measured after a liquid standard meal (Sustacal; Mead Johnson, Evansville, IN). Adverse events and hypoglycemic episodes were recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter a liquid meal challenge, nateglinide rapidly increased mealtime insulin levels within 30 min of drug intake and reduced mealtime glucose excursions without affecting triglyceride levels. At study end point, reduction of HbA1c levels was statistically significantly greater with nateglinide at doses of 60, 120, and 180 mg than placebo (-0.45, -0.62, and -0.64%, respectively; P<0.05). The mean level of FPG was significantly reduced versus placebo in the nateglinide 120-mg group only (-1.14 mmol/l P<0.01). Overall, nateglinide was well tolerated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrated that nateglinide improves mealtime and mean glycemic control in a dose-dependent manner by restoring early insulin secretion phase.

The patients were treated for 3 months with diet alone (30 kcal/kg per day) (n = 15), diet with voglibose (n = 12), or diet with glyburide (n = 9). They underwent 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing, assessment of insulin sensitivity (SI), and acute insulin response (AIR) with intravenous glucose tolerance testing based on the minimal model, and measurement of abdominal visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue area (SAT) by computed tomography before and after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe diabetic patients had comparable SAT but larger VAT than the control subjects. With a mean weight loss of 2-3 kg, VAT and SAT were decreased similarly in all treatment groups. The VAT-to-SAT ratio was decreased only in the voglibose group. Glycemic control and serum lipid profiles were improved in all groups. Changes in glycemic control after diet were closely correlated with changes in VAT but not with changes in SAT. SI and AIR were unchanged in the diet group but were improved in the voglibose and glyburide groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn Japanese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who were relatively lean but had excess VAT, diet with or without voglibose or glyburide effectively reduced VAT. Decrease in VAT was closely associated with improvement of glycemic control with diet. Additional use of voglibose or low-dose glyburide had no detrimental effects on abdominal adiposity and had beneficial effects on SI and AIR.", "outbound_citations": ["11423510", "10866038", "10857936", "10372240", "10331409", "10333947", "9589225", "9588440", "8787683", "7589820", "8536820", "7988316", "1897468", "2684710", "2975544", "2890903", "3721806", "3710689"], "inbound_citations": ["36498669", "32504833", "28685995"], "label": "0"}

Karen Earle, Robert Rushakoff, and Ira Goldfine have presented an interesting case report of hypoglycemia due to an inadvertent glimepiride overdosage.1 This article makes an important point that in a hypoglycemic patient with elevated serum insulin and C-peptide levels, indicating endogenous production of excessive insulin, even a negative urine or blood screen for sulfonylureas does not always exclude a diagnosis of an inadvertent or factitious overdosage of an oral antidiabetic drug. A negative sulfonylurea screen in this setting can be misleading, because three oral antidiabetic agents will not be assayed for on a routine sulfonylurea screen. These drugs are glimepiride, repaglinide, and nateglinide. Of these three drugs, only glimepiride is a sulfonylurea. A patient suspected of an overdose with an antidiabetes drug will not be identified, and the screening test will be reported as negative if any of these three drugs is responsible for an overdosage. A rule of thumb in clinical pharmacology is that a drug effect will persist until three halflives have passed following the final dose. Repaglinide and nateglinide are relatively short-acting non-sulfonylurea antidiabetic agents with half-lives of 1 h for repaglinide and 1.3 h for nateglinide. According to the \u201crule,\u201d the effects of the two non-sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents will persist for only 3\u20134 h after an overdosage. Glimepiride has a half-life of 5 h, indicating that an effect will persist for 15 h following an overdosage. This half-life indicates that there is time for a patient who overdoses on glimepiride to be transported to an emergency room, receive glucose to normalize the blood glucose level, and then (without further monitoring and additional treatment) become hypoglycemic again before the drug is fully metabolized. A short-acting oral agent is less likely to produce prolonged hypoglycemia than a longer-acting agent. By the time a patient who has overdosed on one of the two nonsulfonylurea and short-acting antidiabetic agents reaches the emergency room (probably at least 3\u20134 h later) it would be too late to even screen for these agents, and the laboratory would not be counted on to make the diagnosis of an overdosage of one of these two agents. It would be necessary to take a history of drugs used by the patient as well as the patient\u2019s family to see if any antidiabetic drugs are in the household. A negative sulfonylurea screen might be considered sufficient to exclude a glimepiride overdosage if the clinician were unaware that this agent is not routinely screened for on the sulfonylurea screen. A diagnosis of glimepiride overdosage would then be missed, and if additional laboratory evidence of endogenous hyperinsulinism is present, then the patient might be misdiagnosed to", "outbound_citations": ["12828829"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

This study assessed the effects on lipid levels of glyburide/metformin tablets in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, particularly in a group of patients who had poor glycemic control and dyslipidemia at baseline. This 52-week, open-label study was an extension of a 32-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The patient population was drawn from 3 groups: those who completed the double-blind study, those who were discontinued from the double-blind study, and those who were ineligible for the double-blind study based on predefined measures of glycemic control (screening fasting plasma glucose > 240 mg/dL and glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] < or = 12%, or HbA1c 11%-12%) and were directly enrolled in the open-label extension study. Patients with an HbA1c of < 9% received glyburide/ metformin tablets 1.25 mg/250 mg BID; those with an HbA1c > or = 9% received glyburide/ metformin tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg BID. Changes in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels were assessed for 52 weeks. The study population included 828 patients: 515 who completed the double-blind study, 138 who were discontinued from the double-blind study, and 175 who were enrolled directly. Direct enrollees had poor glycemic control and dyslipidemia at baseline. Improvements in plasma lipid levels were seen as early as week 13. At week 52, the mean change in TC from baseline was -8.0 mg/dL for the total population (95% CI, -10.9 to -5.2; P < 0.05) and -23.2 mg/dL for direct enrollees (95% CI, -30.1 to -16.4; P < 0.05). The mean decrease in LDL-C from baseline for the total population was 2.86 mg/dL (95% CI, -5.3 to -0.4; P < 0.05), compared with a reduction of 13.3 mg/dL for direct enrollees (95% CI, -18.5 to -8.1; P < 0.05).

Subjects were assessed annually from diagnosis, with measurement of HbA1c, arterial blood pressure (random zero), and three urine samples for estimation of the albumin/creatinine ratio. During follow-up, 63 of 494 children developed MA at one or more annual assessments and were designated as cases for a nested case-control study. Each case was matched for sex and age at diagnosis with two normoalbuminuric control subjects. Blood pressure (BP) data were compared at corresponding years of diabetes duration.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCases with MA were similar to normoalbuminuric control subjects with respect to age and BMI, but they had higher mean HbA1c levels (mean difference 1.1%, P < 0.001). In the years before the onset of MA, the diastolic BP standard deviation score (SDS) was significantly higher than zero in cases (mean 0.49, P < 0.001) and in control subjects (0.50, P < 0.001). No difference could be detected between cases and control subjects before the onset of MA in either systolic or diastolic BP (mean difference systolic -1.2 mmHg [95% CI -4.7 to 2.7], mean difference diastolic 0.1 mmHg [-2.4 to 2.6]). However, within the cases, the onset of MA was associated with elevations in systolic and diastolic BP SDSs (F = 16.1, P < 0.001; and F = 18.0, P < 0.001). BMI, but not HbA1c, was associated with systolic and diastolic BP SDSs in the subjects with MA (F = 0.6, P = 0.4; and F = 12.3, P = 0.001). However, the association of BP with MA remained signifcant for systolic BP (P = 0.001) and for diastolic BP (P < 0.001) after adjusting for BMI.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA rise in systemic BP cannot be detected before the first appearance of MA in children with type 1 diabetes. BP rises concurrently with the onset of MA and is also closely related to BMI.", "outbound_citations": ["11128358", "10064671", "10097935", "9648837", "9713006", "9703338", "9300227", "9051372", "8829124", "8729162", "7648820", "7926296", "7955992", "8366922", "1313473", "1849524", "2149686", "1969518", "3280484", "3523245", "3873913", "6738599", "624438"], "inbound_citations": ["35913059", "31860926", "30093549", "29535943", "29423321"], "label": "0"}

After a 30-day run-in period of dietary treatment, patients received combined glyburide (5, 7.5 or 10 mg/day) and metformin (800, 1,200 or 1,600 mg/day) as preconstitued, fixed combinations, or glyburide alone (5, 10 or 15 mg/day).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted an open, prospective, randomized, and comparative study comprising a total of 60 patients selected and placed in two parallel groups. We had previously confirmed that the subjects had secondary failure to high doses of sulfonylureas. The initial metformin dosage was a single 850 mg tablet, and the dosage was increased to two or three tablets depending on the patient's metabolic changes. The initial dosage of DNA-recombinant insulin was 24 U, subcutaneously administered and divided into two portions: two-thirds at around 8:00 A.M., before breakfast, and the remaining third at 8:00 P.M., before dinner. The dosage was adjusted based on the patient's clinical and metabolic response. RESULTS The initial average glucose value for the metformin group was 269.1 \u00b1 32.2 mg/dl, decreasing by the end of the study to 159.7 \u00b1 30.5 mg/dl. For the insulin group, these figures went from 270.7 \u00b1 24.0 mg/dl at the beginning of the study to 134.8 \u00b1 26.7 mg/dl. This decrease correlates with the reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin from 12.8 to 8.9% for the first group and from 12.3 to 8.2% for the second, as well as with the reduction in triglyceride values from 230.3 to 183.1 mg/dl and from 218.4 to 186.3 mg/dl, respectively. The BMI (27.5\u201326.4), blood pressure (systolic from 145.7\u2013132.1 mmHg, diastolic from 90.3\u201384.8 mmHg), and total cholesterol levels (235\u2013202 mg/dl) decreased in only the metformin group. CONCLUSIONS Metformin is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment that improves metabolic control and favorably modifies secondary clinical alterations due to insulin resistance, such as arterial hypertension, overweight, and hyperlipidemia, in obese patients with NIDDM suffering from secondary failure to sulfonylureas.", "outbound_citations": ["7623903", "7623902", "7555503", "7995625", "8013758", "8282343", "8412779", "1600835", "1551495", "1955512", "2162756", "2136557", "3170749", "2967151", "3552509", "3552515", "3897043", "3935560", "6352352", "520116", "387488", "1276694"], "inbound_citations": ["36853844", "34805192", "29248426"], "label": "0"}

The aim of our study was to evaluate the quality of life (QOL) in diabetic patients and the factors affecting it in type 2 diabetic mellitus patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study that included 86 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in the territory of the City of Ni\u0161. Health-related QOL of patients was measured using the short form survey (SF-36) that produces an 8-scale health profile. The average duration of diabetes was 12.76\u00b18.08 years. The best QOL in all areas was observed in patients diagnosed with diabetes less than 10 years ago p<0.05) and younger than 65 years. Male respondents perceived a better QOL compared to women, especially in the vitality and pain domains. The patients with comorbidity (93.64%) had lower QOL score in all domains. There was no significant difference in the QOL of patients with diabetes compared to the level of education. High QOL represents an ultimate goal and an important outcome of all medical interventions in diabetic patients. Factors related to lower QOL included: older age, female gender, and existence of comorbidities. Uncontrolled diabetic patients had a lower QOL than controlled diabetics. Sa\u017eetak Prisustvo dijabetesa dovodi do pada kvaliteta \u017eivota u svim domenima. Cilj na\u0161eg istra\u017eivanja bio je da procenimo kvalitet \u017eivota bolesnika sa dijabetesom tip 2 i da utvrdimo faktore koji na to uti\u010du. Sprovedena je studija preseka na teritoriji grada Ni\u0161a kojom je obuhva\u0107eno 86 bolesnika sa dijabetes melitusom tip 2. Kvalitet \u017eivota bolesnika procenjen je pomo\u0107u upitnika SF-36. Prose\u010dna du\u017eina trajanja dijabetesa iznosila je 12.76\u00b18.08 godina. Najbolji kvalitet \u017eivota u svim domenima uo\u010den je kod bolesnika mla\u0111ih od 65 godina i kod onih kod kojih je dijabetes melitus dijagnostikovan pre manje od 10 godina (p<0.05). Mu\u0161karci su prijavili bolji kvalitet \u017eivota od \u017eena, posebno u oblasti vitalnosti i bolova. Bolesnici sa komorbiditetima (93.64%) su imali ni\u017ei kvalitet \u017eivota u svim domenima.

Despite the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, existing treatment strategies often fail. New oral agents give a wider segment of the population with type 2 diabetes hope of achieving near-normal blood-glucose levels. Troglitazone, a novel chemical entity, is one promising new agent. We conducted an economic analysis based on glycemic-control data from a randomized clinical trial comparing troglitazone with placebo, each added to glyburide. A patient simulation model was used to translate these data to long-term outcomes associated with diabetes. Patients had poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus despite glyburide therapy. Risk functions of developing and progressing through nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, hypoglycemia, and macrovascular disease were developed from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and large epidemiologic studies. Cost estimates were based on data from 5 states, all payor databases, surveys, and literature. The main outcomes of the model were cost-consequences, number of patients developing each type of complication, mean time to development of the complication, cost per life-year gained (LYG), and cost per quality-adjusted life-year. The model predicts that for every 1000 patients treated with troglitazone, the improved glycemic control could mean that 95 to 140 fewer patients would experience one of the most severe diabetic complications (eg, blindness, end-stage renal disease, amputation), which may increase life expectancy by 2.0 years. These benefits are obtained at an additional $2100 per LYG (undiscounted). The ratio remains <$50,000 per LYG for most variations in input. The clinical trial demonstrated that troglitazone + glyburide improves glycemic control compared with glyburide alone. Based on these results, the model estimates fewer diabetic complications at a cost well below accepted cost-effective thresholds.", "outbound_citations": ["9727892", "9653606", "9516220", "9428834", "9224218", "9135934", "9135935", "8898811", "8799631", "8554206", "7589828", "7671025", "7935656", "8154951", "8366922", "8359108", "8487827", "1306034", "1547676", "2916977", "2644929", "3181642", "3658346", "3743309", "6690964"], "inbound_citations": ["36867279", "35290625", "31571136"], "label": "0"}

In two open\u2010label, two\u2010period, randomized crossover studies, healthy subjects received repaglinide alone, repaglinide on day 5 of ketoconazole treatment, or repaglinide on day 7 of rifampicin treatment. In three open\u2010label, three\u2010period, randomized crossover studies, healthy subjects received 5 days of repaglinide alone; 5 days of ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel, simvastatin, or nifedipine alone; or 5 days of repaglinide concomitant with ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel, simvastatin, or nifedipine. Compared to administration of repaglinide alone, concomitant ketoconazole increased mean AUC0\u2010\u221e for repaglinide by 15% and mean Cmax by 7%. Concomitant rifampicin decreased mean AUC0\u2010\u221e for repaglinide by 31% and mean Cmax by 26%. Concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 substrates altered mean AUC0\u20135h and mean Cmax for repaglinide by 1% and 17% (ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel), 2% and 27% (simvastatin), or 11% and 3% (nifedipine). Profiles of blood glucose concentration following repaglinide dosing were altered by less than 8% by both ketoconazole and rifampicin. In all five studies, most adverse events were related to hypoglycemia, as expected in a normal population given a blood glucose regulator. The safety profile of repaglinide was not altered by pretreatment with ketoconazole or rifampicin or by coadministration with ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel. The incidence of adverse events increased with coadministration of simvastatin or nifedipine compared to either repaglinide or simvastatin/nifedipine treatment alone. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions occurred between repaglinide and the CYP3A4 substrates ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel, simvastatin, or nifedipine. The pharmacokinetic profile of repaglinide was altered by administration of potent inhibitors or inducers, such as ketoconazole or rifampicin, but to a lesser degree than expected. These results are probably explained by the metabolic pathway of repaglinide that involves other enzymes than CYP3A4, reflected to some extent by a small change in repaglinide pharmacodynamics. Thus, careful monitoring of blood glucose in repaglinide\u2010treated patients receiving strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 is recommended, and an increase in repaglinide dose may be necessary. No safety concerns were observed, except a higher incidence in adverse events in patients receiving repaglinide and simvastatin or nifedipine.", "outbound_citations": ["7988782", "7937537", "8314452", "12919179", "11555322", "11452245", "11103752", "10893694", "10664925", "10664920", "10501822", "10383608", "9877000", "9542477", "9088587", "9321523", "8560487", "7995001", "8445813", "8361994", "1449532", "1286134", "1371482", "1559307", "2191822", "2327982"], "inbound_citations": ["36597378", "31952912", "31382371", "30575126", "30636597", "30488793", "30335870", "29384369"], "label": "1"}

It is now possible to identify subjects at high risk of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, especially in the patient's family members. Preventive interventions are quickly becoming available, and can help delay the onset of the disease and thereby reduce complications in these subjects. Furthermore the correct etiological diagnosis of diabetes is fundamental in providing the best treatment for the patient. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) syndrome should be suspected in cases of a subtle onset of diabetes and autosomal dominant inheritance. Mitochondrial DNA mutations should be considered when a diabetic patient also suffers from deafness or if there is a family history of this combination in the mother side of the family. Atypical diabetes has to be identified by the physician to avoid mistakes when the patient enters the non-insulin-dependent phase. In the case of Wolfram's syndrome a gene analysis for each family member should be performed to identify heterozygote subjects. Recently, many discoveries in genetics help us better understand the pathogenesis of the diseases and diagnose the monogenic form of diabetes more easily.

Patients: 12 patients with a high grade stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery (n = 10) or left circumflex coronary artery (n = 2), and an angiographically normal corresponding left circumflex artery or left anterior descending artery, respectively. Design: Two Doppler ultrasound wires were positioned in the \u201cnormal\u201d and post-stenotic artery for simultaneous measurements of coronary blood flow velocity under baseline conditions and after intravenous glibenclamide, 0.05 mg/kg body weight. Local coronary blood flow was calculated from the average peak velocity and the cross sectional area derived from quantitative coronary angiographic analysis. Coronary flow reserve was determined after intracoronary injection of 30 \u03bcg adenosine and 12 mg papaverine. Results: One hour after glibenclamide, serum insulin increased from (mean (SD)) 7.4 (2.0) to 44.8 (25.5) mU/l (p < 0.005), and C peptide from 1.4 (0.4) to 3.4 (1.2) ng/l (p = 0.005). In normal coronary arteries coronary flow reserve was 2.6 (0.4) after adenosine and 3.0 (0.4) after papaverine, while in post-stenotic arterial segments it was 1.2 (0.3) after adenosine (p = 0.005) and 1.3 (0.3) after papaverine (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference after glibenclamide. In non-stenotic arteries, average peak velocity (18.8 (5.2) cm/s) and calculated coronary blood flow (23.8 (10.7) ml/min) were not altered by glibenclamide (18.3 (5.2) cm/s and 22.8 (10.4) ml/min, respectively). In post-stenotic arteries, baseline average peak velocity was 13.3 (4.9) ml/min and coronary blood flow was 9.1 (3.0) ml/min, without significant change after glibenclamide (13.3 (5.2) cm/s, 9.0 (3.2) ml/min). Conclusions: Glibenclamide, 0.05 mg/kg intravenously, is effective in increasing serum insulin, suggesting a KATP channel blocking effect in pancreatic \u03b2 cells. It does not compromise coronary blood flow and vasodilatation in response to adenosine and papaverine in post-stenotic and angiographically normal coronary arteries at rest.", "outbound_citations": ["8877293", "10926635", "10882810", "10758983", "10758984", "10728426", "10722911", "10448615", "10367585", "10979714", "10213347", "9890407", "10600828", "9935017", "9863741", "9742976", "9486663", "9321819", "9302359", "9534276", "8977166", "8960843", "8921787", "8901685", "8806335", "8804781", "8613554", "8680745", "7653639", "7814627", "8037088", "8044938", "7923296", "7923284", "1572046", "2117388", "2107575", "3932228", "4006657", "832350", "4926376", "PMC507146", "PMC1909199", "PMC295430", "PMC1728790", "9813550"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Of the 3 groups of drugs currently available for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the sulphonylureas and metformin are, in general, well-tolerated and generally safe. In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, however, care must be exercised in the use of many of these drugs, as accumulation, either of the active drug or of active metabolites, can lead to serious adverse effects such as hypoglycaemia or, with metformin, lactic acidosis. The sulphonylurea drugs, to a greater or lesser degree, are metabolised in the liver to a variety of active or inactive compounds which, in general, are excreted by the kidneys. In addition, varying amounts of parent compound may depend on renal elimination. As a result, sulphonylurea drugs such as tolazamide, acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (glyburide) are more likely to cause significant hypoglycaemia, as the metabolism of these drugs, compared with other commonly prescribed sulphonylureas, can lead to the accumulation of either the parent drug or the active metabolite in the presence of renal insufficiency. Tolbutamide, glipizide, gliclazide and gliquidone are much less likely to cause hypoglycaemia as their metabolites are either inactive or have minimal hypoglycaemic potency. Metformin is dependent on renal excretion and is not significantly metabolised. As a result, caution is required when treating patients with renal insufficiency where metformin accumulation can occur, with the danger of lactic acidosis. Although the correlation between creatinine clearance (CLCR) and total oral clearance of drug is weaker than the correlation between CLCR and renal clearance (CLR) of metformin, it is clear that renal insufficiency is associated with most cases of metformin-induced lactic acidosis. For this reason, clinicians in general would regard a raised plasma creatinine as a contraindication to metformin treatment. Acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, and a relatively new agent for treating NIDDM, is likely to be safe in patients with impaired renal function, as the drug is not significantly absorbed from the gut, but data on this subject are lacking.", "outbound_citations": ["7734015", "1600835", "2677730", "2798990", "3301149", "3081293", "3984386", "7041933", "7306436", "109099", "710026", "569611", "690998", "651643", "200493", "1017154", "4631138", "4626706", "5053812", "4638970", "5141777", "5793755", "6057070", "6022563", "5334897", "5968015", "5936465", "14261407", "14067739", "387488", "337162", "6411511", "1451945", "7021124", "499320", "3075902", "4772978", "406158", "4772979", "927538"], "inbound_citations": ["33035600", "30595699", "29227654"], "label": "1"}

The study consisted of an initial screening day, a titration period of 3 weeks, a 1-week stabilization period, a study period, and an end-of-study day. During the 3-day study period, half the patients of each group received two meals on the first day and three meals on the next 2 days, and in the other half, this sequence was reversed. Repaglinide was administered preprandially with each meal, and glyburide was administered as recommended in current labeling, i.e., either one or two daily doses before breakfast and dinner, regardless of whether lunch had been omitted. The diurnal blood glucose excursions on a day in which three meals were eaten were compared between the two groups, and the minimum blood glucose concentration (BGmin) measurements were compared between lunch and dinner on days with three and two meals.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 83 randomized patients, 43 entered into the 3-day study period and completed the trial. The results showed no significant differences between the repaglinide and glyburide groups in average blood glucose excursions from fasting blood glucose (P = 0.44). The influence on the mean BGmin of omitting a meal differed significantly between the repaglinide and glyburide groups (P = 0.014). In the latter group, BGmin decreased from 77 to 61 mg/dl as a result of omitting lunch, whereas in the repaglinide group, BGmin was unchanged for the two-meal day (78 mg/dl) and the three-meal day (76 mg/dl). All hypoglycemic events (n = 6) occurred in the glyburide group on the two-meal day, in connection with omitting lunch. No hypoglycemic events were recorded in the repaglinide group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest that treatment with repaglinide in well-controlled type 2 diabetic patients who miss or delay a meal is superior to treatment with longer-acting sulfonylurea drugs (such as glyburide) with respect to the risk of hypoglycemic episodes.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31884929", "28920861"], "label": "1"}

During the last decade there was an increased interest in the use of oral antihyperglycemic agents (OAHAs) as an alternative to insulin in achieving good glycemic control. OAHAs are divided into four groups: derivatives of sulfonylurea, biguanides, glucosidase inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. This review describes the possible teratogenic effects of the use of OAHAs during pregnancy and the effects of these drugs during lactation. Animal and human studies assessing the teratogenic effects of OAHAs have yielded conflicting data because the risk of major malformations in infants of mothers with diabetes appears to be related to maternal glycemic control rather than the antidiabetic therapy. A major concern with the use of OAHAs during pregnancy is neonatal hypoglycemia, which may be severe and persist for days. Therefore, insulin is still the drug of choice because it has not been implicated as a teratogen in human pregnancies. In addition, because of the lack of data regarding the use of OAHAs in pregnancy, we cannot draw firm conclusions about all of the available drugs. However, OAHAs, especially glibenclamide (glyburide), may be beneficial in a situation where the proper use of insulin is problematic. Because there are very limited clinical data on the exposure of OAHAs to the infant via breast milk, and the potentially serious effect of neonatal hypoglycemia, the safest recommendation is not to breast feed while taking OAHAs. Well-conducted, prospective, controlled studies regarding the feasibility of OAHAs in pregnant women with diabetes and during lactation are needed.", "outbound_citations": ["11900497", "11163815", "11036125", "11036118", "10972579", "9746382", "9678539", "9077600", "8722068", "8092211", "8088125", "8177055", "8073364", "8362957", "1681225", "1951536", "6369573", "6777880", "7556974"], "inbound_citations": ["34481828", "33894214"], "label": "0"}

The transport process responsible for this reabsorption has been investigated thus far only in laboratory animals.

The uptake process was found to be obligatorily dependent on Na+ with no involvement of anions. The process was saturable, with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 14 +/- 1 microM. The Na+:carnitine stoichiometry was 1:1. The same process also was found to be responsible for the uptake of acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine, two acyl esters of carnitine with potential for therapeutic use in humans. The uptake process was specific for carnitine and its acyl esters. Betaine, a structural analog of carnitine, interacted with the uptake process to a significant extent. The present studies also showed that sulfonylureas, oral hypoglycemic agents currently used in the management of type 2 diabetes, inhibited the carnitine uptake system. Among the sulfonylureas tested, glibenclamide was the most potent inhibitor. The inhibition was competitive. Glibenclamide inhibited the uptake not only of carnitine but also of acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine. The inhibition most likely was the result of direct interaction of the compound with the carnitine transporter because the inhibition could be demonstrated in purified rat kidney brush border membrane vesicles.", "outbound_citations": ["9685390", "9632645", "9618255", "9533980", "9426230", "29585060", "8865821", "8702418", "8628999", "7502040", "7672113", "7626031", "7716547", "7990927", "8155735", "8237872", "8494353", "1464372", "1555624", "1944900", "1763895", "2235122", "2153122", "3185635", "2838357", "3822602", "6517597", "7451429", "6773946", "6770910"], "inbound_citations": ["31985003", "31255901"], "label": "0"}

This study was performed to evaluate whether this results in a better maintenance of ATP-dependent K+ channel mediated ischaemic myocardial preconditioning.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nIn a double-blind placebo-controlled study the period of total coronary occlusion during balloon angioplasty of high grade coronary artery stenoses was used as a model to compare the effects of both drugs. Quantification of myocardial ischaemia was achieved by recording the intracoronary ECG and the time to the occurrence of angina during vessel occlusion. All patients underwent three dilatations. The first dilatation (dilatation 1) served to determine the severity of ischaemia during vessel occlusion. During dilatation 2, baseline values were recorded. Thereafter, glimepiride (15 patients: 1.162 mg), glibenclamide (15 patients: 2.54 mg) or placebo (15 patients) were intravenously administered over 12 min. Dilatation 3 started 10 min after the beginning of the drug administration. Mean ST segment shifts in the placebo group decreased by 35% (dilatation 2: 0.23; dilatation 3:0.15 mV; CI -0.55 to 0.00 mV; P=0.049). A similar reduction also occurred in the glimepiride group, in which repetitive balloon occlusion led to a 34% reduction (dilatation 2: 0.35; dilatation 3: 0.23 mV; CI -0.21 to -0.02 mV; P=0.01). There was little influence however, on mean ST segment shifts in the glibenclamide group (dilatation 2 and dilatation 3: 0.24 mV; CI -0.10 to 0.25 mV; P=0.34). Accordingly, time to angina during balloon occlusion slightly increased (by 30%) in the placebo group (dilatation 2: 37 s; dilatation 3: 48 s; CI 0.0 to 15.0 s; P=0.16); increased by 13% in the glimepiride group (dilatation 2: 40 s; dilatation 3: 45 s; CI 0.0 to 14.0 s; P=0023); and remained unchanged in the glibenclamide group (dilatation 2 and dilatation 3: 30 s; CI -7.5 to 7.5 s; P=0.67).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results show that glimepiride maintains myocardial preconditioning, while glibenclamide might be able to prevent it.", "outbound_citations": ["8752796", "8763396", "7664446", "7641342", "7805230", "8529504", "8529506", "7930208", "7858767", "8044938", "8172912", "8403330", "8324795", "7679152", "1394937", "1512336", "1510137", "1505561", "1301066", "1310443", "1908730", "1707221", "1908354", "2242528", "2087855", "2317895", "2107575", "2105170", "3769170", "2942314", "2945332", "6310409"], "inbound_citations": ["37049638", "36429732", "33315940", "32811736", "32282393", "32146997", "31748210", "31969305", "3520890", "30202411", "29501322", "29795806", "28990512", "29318412"], "label": "0"}

Of these, only 61 patients completed the study; 27 patients received insulin-placebo and 34 patients received insulin-glipizide. Three skeletal muscle (quadriceps femoris) biopsies were performed in all patients over a 3-year period. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1 was determined every 100 +/- 20 days, including plasma glucose levels. Muscle capillary basement membrane width was quantitated by a previously described method. After approximately 16 months, glycosylated hemoglobin A1 decreased significantly in each group from its baseline (P < 0.001 insulin-glipizide group and P < 0.025 insulin-placebo), although no statistically significant difference was seen between the two groups. After 3 years this decrease was statistically significant (P < 0.001) only in the insulin-glipizide group. At baseline, no statistically significant difference was found in the muscle capillary basement membrane width between the two groups. In spite of the significant decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin A1 in both groups after 14 to 16 months, only muscle capillary basement membrane width in the insulin-glipizide group decreased significantly compared with baseline. Patients receiving insulin-placebo showed a gradual increase in the muscle capillary basement membrane width, which after 3 years was significantly higher than baseline (P < 0.02). Although the mechanisms by which the addition of glipizide to insulin treatment reduced the thickening of the muscle capillary basement membrane are not clearly understood, the current findings suggest that diabetic microangiopathy is not necessarily progressive and that prophylaxis may be attained.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33190640"], "label": "0"}

All patients were submitted for 14 days to therapy with 5 injections of insulin per day in total dose of insulin permitting to decrease the mean daily glycaemia below 8.8 mmol/l (160 mg/dl). After the termination of the intensive insulin therapy (IIT) the patients with insulin requirement below 44 U daily were alternatively qualified to treatment with SU (glybenclamide) alone or with this SU plus biguanide derivate (BG: phenformin), and those who needed more than 44 U daily continued conventional therapy with insulin alone or with insulin plus SU (glybenclamide). There was a marked reduction of fasting and postprandial blood glucose during the IIT and over the subsequent 15 months of the follow-up. The mean glycaemia which initially was in fasting state 12.5 +/- 2.4 mmol/l (225 +/- 43 mg/dl) and 2 hours after breakfast 18.1 +/- 2.8 mmol/l (325 +/- 50 mg/dl) decreased significantly and was in four groups between 8.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (144 +/- 5 mg/dl) and 10.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (194 +/- 9 mg/dl) in fasting state and between 10.5 +/- 0.3 (189 +/- 5 mg/dl) and 11.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (201 +/- 7 mg/dl) after breakfast. The least hypoglycaemic effect was found in patients who after IIT were treated exclusively with insulin (mean daily dose 53 +/- 2 IU) while the decrease of glycaemia was most evident in patients treated with SU given as a single drug or in combination with BG or with insulin (mean daily dose 19 +/- 1 IU). In all studied patients basal and stimulated (1 mg glucagon i.v.) C-peptide secretion markedly decreased during IIT, and greatly increased after its termination, and this increase persisted over following 15 months of observation, correlating with the initial values.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe short-term IIT in patients with NIDDM and secondary failure to SU is effective in reducing hyperglycaemia, and in most of them makes possible to continue the oral antidiabetic treatment with SU. The secretion of endogenous insulin seems to have only limited influence on the metabolic control of the patients treated with four different pharmacological regiments after IIT.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

In animal models of insulin resistance, rosiglitazone decreased plasma glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels and also attenuated or prevented diabetic nephropathy and pancreatic islet cell degeneration. In contrast with troglitazone, rosiglitazone does not induce cytochrome P4503A4 metabolism. It does not interact significantly with nifedipine, oral contraceptives, metformin, digoxin, ranitidine or acarbose. In clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, rosiglitazone 2 to 12 mg/day (as a single daily dose or 2 divided daily doses) improved glycaemic control, as shown by decreases in fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Addition of rosiglitazone 2 to 8 mg/day to existing sulphonylurea, metformin or insulin therapy achieved further reductions in fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c. Oral combinations improved insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function according to a homeostasis model assessment. Consistent with its mechanism of action, rosiglitazone appears to be associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia (<2% of patients receiving monotherapy).

This strategy controls symptoms effectively in most patients, at least in the short term, by reducing glycemia and initiating weight loss where appropriate. It also stresses the importance of diet in diabetes management. However, if the fasting plasma glucose level continues to increase after diet therapy is started, a decision must be made to continue with diet alone or to start intensive therapy with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin. We have reported on the efficacy of these therapeutic options in the main randomization group of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPS) [3, 4]. Here, we report the response to treatment with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin in a subgroup of patients recruited to the UKPS who continued to have marked hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic symptoms during the initial 3 months of diet therapy and in whom continued diet therapy alone was not an option. We sought to determine whether clinical or biochemical characteristics at diagnosis helped to define this subgroup of patients, whom we called the primary diet failure group, and the extent to which the different intensive therapies maintained control of blood glucose levels over 6 years of follow-up. We also compared the efficacy of the therapies in the primary diet failure group with that in the main randomization group. Methods Patients In the parent study, we enrolled 4075 patients aged 25 to 65 years with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (fasting plasma glucose level > 6 mmol/L on two occasions) from 15 centers between 1977 and 1991. Patients were excluded if they had ketonuria (ketone concentration > 3 mmol/L) (2% of referrals), a history of myocardial infarction in the previous year, or current angina or heart failure; had had more than one major vascular episode; had a serum creatinine level greater than 175 mol/L, severe retinopathy requiring photocoagulation, malignant hypertension, an uncorrected endocrine abnormality, or severe intercurrent illness likely to limit life expectancy; or required extensive systemic therapy [3]. The parent study was approved by the institutional review board of each hospital and was conducted in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki as amended in Tokyo (1975), Venice (1983), and Hong Kong (1989). Initial Diet Therapy and Randomization Initially, patients were seen monthly and prescribed a diet consisting of about 50% carbohydrates, low saturated fat, and moderately high fiber, with reduced total calorie content if patients were obese (>120% of ideal body weight). During this period, we identified 560 patients (13.7%) who had fasting plasma glucose levels greater than 15 mmol/L or persistent symptoms of hyperglycemia. These 560 patients (primary diet failure group) were randomly allocated to intensive treatment after we stratified for obesity [4]. Of the nonobese patients, 56% received sulfonylurea (chlorpropamide or glyburide) and 44% received insulin. Of the obese patients, 42% received sulfonylurea, 32% received insulin, and 26% received metformin (Figure 1). Figure 1. Flow chart showing patients who were entered into the primary diet failure group. At 3 months, 2769 of 4075 patients continued to receive diet therapy alone and were asymptomatic with fasting plasma glucose levels of 6 to 15 mmol/L. These 2769 patients formed the main randomization group of the parent study and were allocated to the same intensive therapies as the primary diet failure group and to a group that was allocated diet therapy alone. Seven hundred forty-six patients had fasting plasma glucose levels less than 6 mmol/L after 3 months of diet therapy (diet satisfactory) and were followed up. We compared patients in the primary diet failure group with those in the main randomization group who received the same intensive therapy allocation. Measurements and Follow-up Sulfonylurea doses were adjusted with the aim of obtaining a fasting plasma glucose level less than 6.0 mmol/L without triggering episodes of hypoglycemia. If fasting plasma glucose levels were 15.0 mmol/L or more at two consecutive clinic visits or if symptoms of hyperglycemia developed while patients received the maximum sulfonylurea dosage (chlorpropamide, 500 mg/d; glyburide, 20 mg/d), metformin was added to the regimen. Glyburide was added if patients met these criteria while receiving the maximum metformin dosage (2550 mg/d). Patients who met these criteria while receiving both sulfonylurea and metformin were switched to insulin. Patients who were randomized or switched to insulin received ultralente insulin (initially, beef Ultratard MC; subsequently, human Ultratard HM, Novo Nordisk, Pease Pottage, United Kingdom) [5]. These patients monitored their blood glucose levels at home if they required more than 14 U of ultralente insulin daily. If blood glucose levels before meals or at bedtime were greater than 7.0 mmol/L, additional soluble insulin, two or three times daily, or twice-daily mixtures of medium-acting and short-acting insulins were advised. We defined monotherapy as allocated therapy with sulfonylurea, metformin, or ultralente insulin alone. At each 3-month visit, all patients were asked about hypoglycemic symptoms. The most severe hypoglycemic episode for each period was recorded; the clinician graded the episode as minor if the patient could treat the symptoms unaided or major if third-party help or medical intervention was necessary. We calculated the mean annual rates for major and all hypoglycemic episodes. The central laboratory monitored fasting plasma glucose levels at individual clinics by using a monthly quality assurance scheme in which a coefficient of variation of less than 4% was maintained. In the central laboratory, glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c) was assayed by using high-pressure liquid chromatography (normal range, 0.045 to 0.062), and plasma insulin was assayed by using radioimmunoassay with 100% cross-reactivity to proinsulin [6]. Levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol were measured directly by precipitation methods [7]. The Homeostasis Model Assessment [8-10], a structural model of glucose-insulin interactions, was used to estimate the percentages of -cell function and insulin sensitivity that would induce the measured fasting levels of insulin and glucose of each participant. Percentages of -cell function and insulin sensitivity were expressed in relation to a reference group of 40 normoglycemic persons (age, 18 to 25 years; body mass index, 18 to 25 kg/m2) and were assessed in all patients at randomization. They were also assessed in patients who continued to receive sulfonylurea or metformin therapy at 1 year. Diabetic retinopathy was assessed by a modified Wisconsin grading of color retinal photography of four horizontal, 30-degree fields per eye [3, 11]. The presence of retinopathy was defined as grade 20-20 or worse (that is, microaneurysm in both eyes or more severe retinopathy in one eye). Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were done by using SAS software [12] according to allocated therapy on an intention-to-treat basis, except where stated. For description of the groups, the mean SD, the geometric mean (1-SD interval), or the median (interquartile range) is given. For differences across time, data are expressed as the mean with a 95% CI. Percentages are quoted with 95% CIs except where the actual numbers of patients are given. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, t-test, or analysis of variance with paired comparisons using a Bonferroni correction to compare groups, and we used chi-square tests to compare proportions. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare data between groups across time. Adjustment for baseline values used analysis of covariance. We calculated estimates of survival functions for time to requirement of additional therapy by using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method. For this analysis, patients were placed in three groups according to tertiles of the distributions of age or body mass index at randomization. For all analyses, a P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Annual data for body weight and fasting plasma glucose level were calculated as the median of three consecutive visits for each patient (the annual visit and the preceding and subsequent 3-month visit). Hemoglobin A1c concentrations and plasma levels of insulin and lipids were assessed annually. Role of Industry Sponsors Our study was supported in part by pharmaceutical companies, including Novo Nordisk; Bayer; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Hoechst; Lilly; Lipha; and Farmitalia Carlo Erba. Additional assistance was granted by Boehringer Mannheim, Becton Dickinson, Owen Mumford, Securicor, Kodak, and Cortecs Diagnostics. None of the funding sources had a role in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data or in the decision to publish this report. Results We present 6-year follow-up data for 458 of 560 patients in the primary diet failure group and 1620 of 2769 patients in the main randomization group. The remaining patients were lost to follow-up (main randomization group, 96 [3%]; primary diet failure group, 10 [5%]), had died (main randomization group, 144 [5%]; primary diet failure group, 11 [5%]), or had not reached the 6-year time point (main randomization group, 909 [33%]; primary diet failure group, 81 [36%]). At baseline, patients who were followed did not differ from those who were not. The median time spent receiving diet therapy alone from recruitment to randomization was 42 days (95% CI, 22 to 63 days) in the primary diet failure group and 103 days (CI, 91 to 119 days) in the main randomization group (P < 0.001). Clinical and Biochemical Characteristics at Baseline Patients in the primary diet failure group were significantly younger and less obese than patients in the main randomization group (Table 1).

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search identified all relevant articles, including reviews; Bayer Pharmaceuticals. STUDY SELECTION: Due to the large number of clinical trials available, specific criteria were used to narrow the focus of this review: (1) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study design; (2) a minimum of 25 patients enrolled per treatment arm; (3) a treatment duration of 90 days or more; and (4) adherence to Food and Drug Administration Good Clinical Practice guidelines. DATA EXTRACTION: All clinical trials that were available up to December 1995 were reviewed. Preliminary trials and unpublished reports were not reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Acarbose is effective in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. It does not stimulate endogenous insulin secretion and, therefore, will not cause hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. The enhanced glycemic control achieved with acarbose is additive to that of sulfonylureas. It lowers postprandial serum glucose and insulin concentrations and does not promote weight gain. Acarbose can be used as first-line therapy with diet and exercise, or it can be used in combination with sulfonylureas to lower hemoglobin Alc concentrations an additional 0.5\u20130.9%. Acarbose is not a cure for diabetes, nor is it a substitute for diet, exercise, oral hypoglycemic agents, or insulin. Adverse effects are gastrointestinal and can be diminished by starting with an initial dosage of 25 mg tid. Depending on patient response, the dosage can be increased up to a maximum of 100 mg tid over time.

In this single-centre, open-label, phase-I trial, six healthy male volunteers received 2 mg of the prandial glucose regulator, repaglinide, four times daily for 13 days, 15 min before meals. On the morning of day 7, breakfast was omitted and the dose was given as an oral solution containing 2 mg of (14)C-repaglinide. After oral dosing, a mean peak plasma concentration of repaglinide of 27.74 ng. ml(-1) (range: 16.84-36.65 ng. ml(-1)) was observed with a time to peak concentration of 0.5 h. Approximately 20% of repaglinide and its associated metabolites were distributed into red blood cells. No measurable (14)C-radioactivity was present in whole blood samples 6 h after dosing. Within 96 h of dosing with (14)C-repaglinide, 90% of the administered dose appeared in the faeces and 8% was excreted in urine. In the plasma, the major compound was repaglinide (61%). In the urine, the major metabolites were unidentified polar compounds, the aromatic amine (M(1)) (24%), and the dicarboxylic acid (M(2)) (22%). In the faeces, the major metabolite was M(2) (66% of administered dose). Therefore, repaglinide was excreted predominantly as metabolites and the major in vivo metabolite of repaglinide in humans was M(2). During regular dosing for 6 days, the morning plasma trough levels of repaglinide were, with very few exceptions, almost always too low to measure, indicating the absence of accumulation at this dose of 2 mg four times daily. Repaglinide was well tolerated, and there were no episodes of hypoglycaemia. After oral dosing with repaglinide, the mean peak plasma concentration was rapidly attained and, thereafter, plasma concentrations decreased promptly. The major route of excretion was via the faeces. These properties make repaglinide a suitable insulin secretagogue for all patients with type-2 diabetes who retain sufficient beta-cell function.", "outbound_citations": ["9877000", "9519738", "8894500", "8592553", "8607437"], "inbound_citations": ["37189682", "34428046", "33088647", "31382371", "31162534", "29720472", "29381228"], "label": "0"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Sixteen patients with NIDDM who had demonstrated a fall in fasting plasma glucose concentration > 2.2 mmol/l in response to glipizide treatment but continued to have fasting plasma glucose concentrations > 8.3 mmol/l were studied. Fasting glucose, GHb, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were determined, and resistance to insulin-mediated glucose disposal was estimated by measuring the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration at the end of a 180-min infusion of somatostatin, glucose, andinsulin. In addition, plasma glucose, insulin, and TG concentrations were measured at frequent intervals from 0800 to 2400, with patients eating breakfast at 0800 and lunch at 1200. Vitamin A was also given at lunch, and the retinyl ester content in plasma and in chylomicron (Svedberg flotation constant [Sr] > 400) and the chylomicron remnant (Sr 20\u2013400) fractions were used to quantify the concentration of postprandial intestinal TG-rich lipoprotein from 1200 to 2400. RESULTS Fasting plasma glucose concentrations (6.8 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 10.5 \u00b1 0.4 mmol/l), GHb levels (7.9 \u00b1 0.3 vs. 10.8 \u00b1 0.5%), and day-long plasma glucose concentrations were all significantly lower after metformin treatment (P < 0.001), which was associated with a significant (P < 0.001) fall in SSPG concentration (11.0 \u00b1 0.9 to 9.6 \u00b1 0.6 mmol/l). In addition, postprandial concentrations of glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, and TG were lower (P < 0.001) following metformin treatment. Postprandial retinyl ester concentrations were also lower in plasma by 33 \u00b1 5.7% (P < 0.001) and in both the chylomicron (32 \u00b1 7.2%, P < 0.001) and chylomicron remnant (26 \u00b1 7.0%, P < 0.005) fractions. CONCLUSIONS Addition of metformin to sulfonylurea-treated patients with NIDDM with less than optimal glycemic control was associated with improved glycemic control, lower postprandial insulin and TG concentrations, and a decrease inpostprandial concentration of TG-rich lipoproteins of intestinal origin. All of these changes might be expected to decrease risk of coronary heart disease.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35908083", "35890109", "34200427", "32994049", "32231641", "31014100", "30688410", "29960584", "29405635", "29853564"], "label": "0"}

LVDD was evaluated by Doppler echocardiography, which included the use of the Valsalva maneuver and pulmonary venous recordings to unmask a pseudonormal pattern of left ventricular filling.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLVDD was found in 28 subjects (60%), of whom 13 (28%) had a pseudonormal pattern of ventricular filling and 15 (32%) had impaired relaxation. Systolic function was normal in all subjects, and there was no correlation between LVDD and indexes of metabolic control.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLVDD is much more common than previously reported in subjects with well-controlled type 2 diabetes who are free of clinically detectable heart disease. The high prevalence of this phenomenon in this high-risk population suggests that screening for LVDD in type 2 diabetes should include procedures such as the Valsalva maneuver and pulmonary venous recordings to unmask a pseudonormal pattern of ventricular filling.", "outbound_citations": ["9109692", "9096915", "8887883", "8760175", "9162606", "8624869", "7786661", "7619351", "7750035", "7859895", "7924771", "8111764", "1414944", "1392171", "1538067", "2404638", "2683698", "2521427", "3364373", "3591685", "6730848", "6880859", "709763", "4835750"], "inbound_citations": ["37146415", "37239956", "36941646", "36934979", "37067056", "36204578", "36093165", "35877579", "35783195", "35709167", "35495842", "36284986", "34831374", "34627874", "34627704", "34533037", "34113491", "33969314", "33783483", "33855087", "33400138", "34849288", "33364978", "33307298", "33520819", "32775437", "32310054", "33786504", "32212368", "31902323", "31653946", "31451315", "31284526", "30922976", "31212580", "30724013", "30078623", "30995812", "31805945", "30877708", "30412438", "29392627", "30559720", "30217497", "30337334", "30314666", "30258845", "30037278", "30190647", "30122238", "29457265", "29867479", "29420147", "29650092", "29413646", "29330646", "29308692", "28980272", "28165130", "29137850", "29349500", "29121924"], "label": "0"}

Thus, the effect of acarbose alone accounts for 0.7 or 0.5% respectively, whereas the effect of teaching and diet in a special diabetes unit (the difference from the study to placebo) accounts for 1.3% of HbA1c. Home monitored blood and urine glucose values were improved: The postprandial blood glucose concentrations, the postprandial differences, the mean blood glucose concentrations and the glycosuria were decreased during acarbose treatment in comparison with placebo. The preprandial blood glucose concentrations before breakfast and supper were not influenced by acarbose.

It is, therefore, possible that previous studies may have overlooked the possible benefits of tight control of post-prandial hyperglycaemia as an important factor in reducing the cardiovascular mortality. Nateglinide is a novel D-phenylalanine derivative that inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels in pancreatic \u03b2-cells in the presence of glucose and thereby restores first phase insulin response in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

The potency of sulfonamide has increased with the generations. However, this potency is compensated in practice by the dose prescribed, which is much smaller for recent generations. The half-life is a far more important property. The effective action period is correlated with half-life but is much longer. The action period for \"short-term\" sulfonamides is < or = 24 h (tolbutamide, glipizide) and can exceed 24 h for \"long-term\" sulfonamides (e.g. glibenclamide). Metabolism and elimination reduce the risk of accumulation. All sulfonamides are metabolised more than 95% by the liver. The metabolites are inactive except for one from glibenclamide. As a function of their action period and possibly of intrinsic properties, some sulfonamides more than others (e.g. glibenclamide) affect fasting hepatic glucose production, which is particularly increased early in the day in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients because of a circadian drop in insulin sensitivity (dawn phenomenon). Finally, in chronic administration, all sulfonamides cause a progressive desensitisation of the beta cell, which responds by an insulin secretion peak only during food intake. This condition indicates the unuselessness of sulfonamide fractionation and, contrary to the classic notion, the low risk of hypoglycaemia after a meal is skipped. The ideal product would be a sulfonamide with high potency and an ultra-short half-life, but capable of maintaining plasma concentrations for 24 h (which might seem incompatible except in continuous administration). Moreover, it would exert its action at relatively low levels of insulinaemia and be completely metabolisable. Glipizide in its osmotic oral form (Ozidia) satisfies all these conditions since it is a very potent sulfonamide with a quite short half-life but with intestinal delivery up to 16 h after administration because of its osmotic principle. It controls fasting glycaema better than ordinary glipizide and at least as well as glibenclamide by acting on hepatic glucose production. Compared to glibenclamide, it has the advantage of generation this effect at lower levels of insulinaemia. In comparison with normal glipizide, it allows identical control for lower postprandial inslinaemias, which is proof of its powerful inductive effect on insulin sensitivity.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Ten obese patients with NIDDM were studied before and after 8 weeks of treatment with a weight-maintaining diet in combination with the sulphonylurea gliclazide. Gliclazide treatment was associated with significant reductions in HbA1C (p=0.001) and fasting plasma glucose (p=0.005) as well as enhanced beta-cell responses to an oral glucose load. During euglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic clamp (2 mU x kg-1 x min-1) in combination with indirect calorimetry, a 35% (p=0.005) increase in whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate, predominantly due to an increased non-oxidative glucose metabolism (p=0.02) was demonstrated in teh gliclazide-treated patients when compared to pre-treatment values. In biopsies obtained from vastus lateralis muscle during insulin infusion, the half-maximal activation of glycogen synthase was achieved at a significantly lower concentration of the allosteric activator glucose 6-phosphate (p=0.01). However, despite significant increases in both insulin-stimulated non-oxidative glucose metabolism and muscle glycogen synthase activation in gliclazide-treated patients no changes were found in levels of glycogen synthase mRNA or immunoreactive protein in muscle.

The high rate of microvascular and macrovascular complications developing in these patients will place an even higher burden on our healthcare systems. Several pathophysiological factors are involved in the development of complications, among which are hyperglycaemia per se, the consequent formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and the intracellular accumulation of sorbitol. In addition, hypertension and dyslipidaemia also play an important role, especially in the development of coronary heart disease and stroke. The major therapeutic goals in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are to reduce obesity and normalise lipid disturbances and increased blood pressure, in order to improve the well-being of the patient and reduce the risk of the development of late diabetic complications. Often, pharmacological treatment of the hyperglycaemia is necessary, in which case sulphonylureas, metformin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose, or insulin may be employed. It is believed that medical interventions, by their effect on improving metabolic control, reduce the incidence and severity of diabetic complications, especially when considering the toxic effects of glucose and the accumulation of AGEs as a consequence of raised tissue glucose levels. This concept is also based on extrapolation of the finding of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial that intensive glycaemic control in IDDM will prevent the progression of at least the microvascular complications like retinopathy and nephropathy. There are, however, no long term studies in NIDDM patients to show that treatment with oral antihyperglycaemic agents helps to postpone or prevent complications. It is expected that the UK Prospective Diabetes Study will show whether better metabolic control, either with oral antihyperglycaemics or with insulin, will indeed improve outcome. Several other studies aiming at specific risk factor intervention (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, lipid oxidation) in NIDDM patients are currently ongoing.", "outbound_citations": ["2109678", "1280575", "3072813", "8864641", "1473615", "6800175", "640303", "6988265", "15531279", "1516760", "1955098", "2065858", "1906023", "2253830", "3282955", "3936738", "4054448", "3888754", "6147291", "6751904", "6988275", "8150221", "1541387", "2253831", "11168965", "8718447", "7587846", "7729307", "7744216", "7968073", "7864934", "8001625", "8039603", "8039601", "8001626", "7924784", "8035098", "8013758", "8198043", "8120522", "8288039", "8112188", "8017462", "28634739", "8312676", "8366922", "8243530", "8376593", "8325447", "8341651", "7691511", "8325978", "8495803", "8492718", "8485123", "8472388", "8462623", "8427759", "1526339", "1465438", "1464241", "1464243", "1411574", "1357346", "1397699", "1398217", "1464414", "1526336", "1526343", "9211066", "1396015", "1499865", "1495978", "1505314", "1459313", "1600835", "1612070", "1600834", "1436266", "1554398", "1569383", "1532777", "1531244", "1547676", "1727735", "1763069", "1576237", "1762301", "1955512", "1943745", "1943726", "1834497", "1838067", "1954810", "2068089", "1647995", "1872304", "1872308", "2037746", "1830524", "1936476", "1713132", "1902426", "1905629", "2010046", "1828740", "1847886", "1991829", "1794270", "1936895", "1752940", "2176495", "2102083", "2148699", "2237405", "2079312", "2204056", "2113013", "2201502", "2111705", "2192848", "2333833", "2157941", "2307293", "2180396", "2180397", "2137750", "2404714", "3371160", "2404481", "2513018", "2686622", "2694775", "2528948", "2664520", "2662408", "2650522", "2523781", "2523787", "2648723", "2915437", "2680553", "2594949", "2651086", "3184351", "3069394", "3418853", "2975549", "3416710", "3259727", "3378684", "3277013", "3125029", "3075899", "2959437", "3600289", "3294899", "3552795", "3106757", "3552532", "3304783", "3552537", "2882967", "3552515", "2948513", "3535494", "3527829", "3529955", "3533670", "3721064", "3517644", "3959907", "3083198", "3017379", "3079965", "2995180", "4077243", "4050825", "2412077", "2862087", "4024018", "3993659", "3920474", "3857597", "3915271", "3935376", "6593734", "6439532", "6384269", "6086432", "6377892", "6242771", "6367725", "6423429", "6367724", "6585811", "6690964", "6420216", "6376034", "6656850", "6360756", "6412862", "6411648", "6870991", "6761187", "6765225", "6759249", "6759246", "6750367", "7057116", "7028540", "7019248", "6985989", "7380107", "6776763", "116480", "111449", "429528", "370980", "116387", "488851", "598565", "992232", "1106937", "1166991", "1091759", "166458", "4919967", "4926376", "4297979", "14202755", "892130", "8495805", "7510610", "1778353", "2677730", "2668699", "3286212", "8487827", "6989693", "913749", "2192847", "8298418", "631459", "7937786", "7821128", "3289989", "1425483", "8213583", "2119168", "2527134", "2967151", "720789"], "inbound_citations": ["36558414", "33435948", "30460578"], "label": "0"}

There is concern that sulphonylureas may increase cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and that high insulin concentrations may enhance atheroma formation. We compared the effects of intensive blood-glucose control with either sulphonylurea or insulin and conventional treatment on the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes in a randomised controlled trial. 3867 newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes, median age 54 years (IQR 48-60 years), who after 3 months' diet treatment had a mean of two fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of 6.1-15.0 mmol/L were randomly assigned intensive policy with a sulphonylurea (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or glipizide) or with insulin, or conventional policy with diet. The aim in the intensive group was FPG less than 6 mmol/L. In the conventional group, the aim was the best achievable FPG with diet alone; drugs were added only if there were hyperglycaemic symptoms or FPG greater than 15 mmol/L. Three aggregate endpoints were used to assess differences between conventional and intensive treatment: any diabetes-related endpoint (sudden death, death from hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke, renal failure, amputation [of at least one digit], vitreous haemorrhage, retinopathy requiring photocoagulation, blindness in one eye, or cataract extraction); diabetes-related death (death from myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, and sudden death); all-cause mortality. Single clinical endpoints and surrogate subclinical endpoints were also assessed. All analyses were by intention to treat and frequency of hypoglycaemia was also analysed by actual therapy. Over 10 years, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 7.0% (6.2-8.2) in the intensive group compared with 7.9% (6.9-8.8) in the conventional group--an 11% reduction. There was no difference in HbA1c among agents in the intensive group. Compared with the conventional group, the risk in the intensive group was 12% lower (95% CI 1-21, p=0.029) for any diabetes-related endpoint; 10% lower (-11 to 27, p=0.34) for any diabetes-related death; and 6% lower (-10 to 20, p=0.44) for all-cause mortality. Most of the risk reduction in the any diabetes-related aggregate endpoint was due to a 25% risk reduction (7-40, p=0.0099) in microvascular endpoints, including the need for retinal photocoagulation. There was no difference for any of the three aggregate endpoints between the three intensive agents (chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin). Patients in the intensive group had more hypoglycaemic episodes than those in the conventional group on both types of analysis (both p<0.0001). The rates of major hypoglycaemic episodes per year were 0.7% with conventional treatment, 1.0% with chlorpropamide, 1.4% with glibenclamide, and 1.8% with insulin. Weight gain was significantly higher in the intensive group (mean 2.9 kg) than in the conventional group (p<0.001), and patients assigned insulin had a greater gain in weight (4.0 kg) than those assigned chlorpropamide (2.6 kg) or glibenclamide (1.7 kg). Intensive blood-glucose control by either sulphonylureas or insulin substantially decreases the risk of microvascular complications, but not macrovascular disease, in patients with type 2 diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)", "outbound_citations": ["10938048", "10937510", "10937499", "10905483", "10580431", "10547208", "10547209", "10566566", "10428734", "10372240", "10079680", "9868971",

The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of PCH among individuals with diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) in adults aged 40-74 years with diabetes who were not using insulin (i.e., they used oral hypoglycemics or received no pharmacological therapy). Each respondent underwent a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. PCH was defined as a 2-h glucose level >or=200 mg/dl.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, PCH was present in 74% of those with diagnosed diabetes. Although it was present in virtually all (99%) of the diabetic adults under suboptimal glycemic control (HbA(1c) >or=7.0%), PCH was also common (39%) among those under optimal control (HbA(1c) <7.0%). Likewise, among sulfonylurea users, PCH was present in 99% of those under suboptimal control and in 63% of those under good control. Similar patterns were observed in those with undiagnosed diabetes. Isolated PCH (2-h glucose >or=200 mg/dl and fasting glucose <126 mg/dl) was present in 9.8% of the adults with diagnosed diabetes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data suggest that PCH is common among diabetic adults in the U.S., even in the setting of \"optimal\" glycemic control and sulfonylurea use. Interventions designed to lower postprandial glucose excursions may help improve overall glycemic control in the general population of U.S. adults with diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["12502614", "11176766", "10977060", "11092289", "10972628", "10491414", "10877745", "10372249", "10381296", "10097918", "9868996", "9773731", "9702426", "9571335", "8849753", "8689856", "7821127", "8366922", "8375241", "6345991"], "inbound_citations": ["36999231", "36564983", "36352762", "34669756", "32739275", "31367236", "30041493"], "label": "0"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Rat islets were perfused with 10 nmol/l GLP-I in combination with 2 \u03bcumol/l glibenclamide. In human experiments, GLP-I (0.75 pmol. kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121) was given as a continuous infusion during 240 min, while glibenclamide (3.5 mg) was administered orally. Eight patients participated in the study (age 57.6 \u00b1 2.7 years, BMI 28.7 \u00b1 1.5 kg/m2, mean \u00b1 SE). In all subjects, blood glucose was first normalized by insulin infusion administered by an artificial pancreas (Biostator). RESULTS GLP-I increased the insulinotropic effect of glibenclamide fourfold in the perfused rat pancreas. In human experiments, treatment with GLP-I alone and in combination with glibenclamide significantly decreased basal glucose levels (5.1 \u00b1 0.4 and 4.5 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 6.0 \u00b1 0.3 mmol/l, P < 0.01), while with only glibenclamide, glucose concentrations remained unchanged. GLP-I markedly decreased total integrated glucose response to the meal (353 \u00b1 60 vs. 724 \u00b1 91 mmol \u03bc l\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121, area under the curve [AUC] [\u201330\u2013180 min], P < 0.02), whereas glibenclamide had no effect (598 \u00b1 101 mmol \u00b7 l\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121, AUC [\u201330\u2013180 min], NS). The combined treatment further enhanced the glucose lowering effect of GLP-I (138 \u00b1 24 mmol \u00b7 l\u22121 \u00b7 min, AUC [\u201330\u2013180 min], P < 0.001). GLP-I, glibenclamide, and combined treat-stimulated meal-induced insulin release as reflected by insulinogenic indexes (control 1.44 \u00b1 0.4; GLP-I 6.3 \u00b1 1.6, P < 0.01; glibenclamide 6.8 \u00b1 2.1, P < 0.01; combination 20.7 \u00b1 5.0, P < 0.001). GLP-I inhibited basal but not postprandial glucagon responses. Using paracetamol as a marker for gastric emptying rate of the test meal, treatment with GLP-I decreased gastric emptying at 180 min by \u223c50% compared with the control subjects (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In acute experiments on overweight patients with NIDDM, GLP-I exerted a marked antidiabetogenic action on the basal and postprandial state. The peptide stimulated insulin, suppressed basal glucagon release, and prolonged gastric emptying. The glucose-lowering effect of GLP-I was further enhanced by glibenclamide. This action may be at least partially accounted for by a synergistic effect of these two compounds on insulin release. Glibenclamide per se enhanced postprandial but not basal insulin release and exerted a less pronounced antidiabetogenic effect compared with GLP-I.", "outbound_citations": ["7988303", "8125072", "7684514", "8381211", "1425125", "1348845", "1547685", "1672112", "1991827", "2472299", "2890903", "2437108", "2409943", "2578253", "6189748", "7055942", "236845", "4722050", "13464070"], "inbound_citations": ["33034350", "28711685"], "label": "0"}

During the clamp a small replacement dose of insulin was given (0.15 mU/kg per min). Isotopically determined glucose-induced glucose uptake was similar before and after GZ administration which led to improved glycaemic control (basal plasma glucose 12.2 +/- 1.3 vs 8.9 +/- 0.7 mmol/l; P < 0.01). Glucose-induced suppression of HGP was, however, more pronounced during GZ treatment (0.96 +/- 0.14 vs 1.44 +/- 0.20 mg/kg per min; P < 0.02). Following GZ treatment hyperglycaemia failed to stimulate glycogen synthase activity. Moreover, GZ resulted in a significant increase in the immunoreactive abundance of the insulin-regulatable glucose transport protein (GLUT 4) (P < 0.02). In conclusion, these results suggest that GZ therapy in type 2 diabetic patients enhances hepatic sensitivity to hyperglycaemia, while glucose-induced glucose uptake remains unaffected. In addition, GZ tends to normalize the activity of glycogen synthase and increases the content of GLUT 4 protein in skeletal muscle.", "outbound_citations": ["1547918", "1959709", "2257997", "2258000", "1535055", "1907347", "1828740", "2003599", "2123890", "2122177", "2354749", "2163201", "2121571", "2677730", "2559864", "2662408", "2661591", "2524334", "2905942", "2975544", "3290006", "3147830", "3366906", "3110217", "3102297", "3517644", "3894118", "3882491", "6368585", "6376034", "6432610", "6618956", "6401923", "6759246", "382871", "5380710", "5659651", "14284029", "510803"], "inbound_citations": ["33932519"], "label": "0"}

However, many of these individuals relapse into hyperglycemia within 1 year. In such patients, we compared the effect of low-dose sulfonylurea and dietary therapy in the prevention of recurrence of hyperglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted an intention-to-treat study in 35 obese newly diagnosed diabetic patients (17 with DKA and 18 with severe hyperglycemia). After discontinuation of insulin, seven of 17 patients with DKA and seven of 18 patients with hyperglycemia were managed with diet and glyburide (1.25\u20132.5 mg/day), whereas other patients were followed with diet alone. In all patients, pancreatic insulin reserve was documented 1 day after resolution of hyperglycemic crises and within 1 week of discontinuation of insulin. Recurrence of hyperglycemia was defined as fasting blood glucose > 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) or random blood glucose > 10 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) on two or more consecutive determinations, or HbA1c > 7.5%. RESULTS Both treatment groups were comparable in age, sex, duration of diabetes, months of insulin therapy, BMI, glucose, and HbA1c. At presentation, the acute C-peptide response to glucagon in obese DKA patients was lower than in patients with hyperglycemia (P < 0.01), but responses were comparable after discontinuation of insulin. Sulfonylurea treatment significantly reduced recurrence of hyperglycemia in both obese DKA and obese hyperglycemic patients (P = 0.03). With a median follow-up of 16 months, hyperglycemia recurred in six of 10 DKA patients and in five of 11 hyperglycemia patients treated with diet alone, compared with one of seven DKA and one of seven hyperglycemia patients treated with glyburide. Readmission with metabolic decompensation occurred in four patients treated with diet but in none of the patients treated with diet and glyburide.

In addition, the study assessed whether these outcomes were influenced by the patients' level of glycaemic control. A total of 253 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio of repaglinide: placebo, with doses taken flexibly with main meals (2-4 per day), whenever they were eaten. Repaglinide was initiated at 0.5 mg per meal, increased to 1 mg after 4 weeks if fasting plasma glucose exceeded 7.8 mmol/l. QoL and treatment satisfaction outcomes were compared using generic and disease-specific self-assessment measures, previously applied in diabetes: the WHO Wellbeing Questionnaire (WHO-WBQ), WHO Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (WHO-DTSQ) and EuroQoL EQ-5D. Over the trial period, repaglinide-treated patients reported a significant 9% improvement in (WHO-DTSQ) treatment satisfaction score (p < 0.05). No significant increase was associated with placebo. The correlation between decrease in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and increase in treatment satisfaction (WHO-DTSQ) was -0.22 (p < 0.01). Scores obtained with the other measures did not change significantly during the trial in either group, but the cohort exhibited only a slight reduction in wellbeing (WHO-WBQ) and health status (EQ-5D) at baseline compared with the background population. In conclusion, flexible mealtime dosing with oral medication appears to be well accepted by pharmacotherapy-na\u00efve patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that repaglinide provides a higher level of treatment satisfaction than placebo, and this may in part relate to improved glycaemic control.", "outbound_citations": ["8556011", "8591815", "12602238", "11194214", "11063280", "11063283", "11113684", "11063281", "10857945", "10631622", "10716587", "10388978", "10522837", "10332683", "10383607", "10100911", "10051177", "11475269", "9877000", "9850489", "9802740", "9817117", "10024935", "9742976", "9706120", "9620105", "10085197", "9519738", "9450510", "9366889", "9314632", "8969335", "10158943", "8742561", "8742562", "8843498", "7587918", "8088122", "8088131", "1499468", "2142043", "10109801", "2967144", "9739505", "9062334", "16464209"], "inbound_citations": ["36498669", "33304826", "31303419"], "label": "1"}

The plasma profile of LA was determined for 24 hours after administration of the dose,and pharmacokinetic analyses were performed. For the safety and tolerability study, 21 patients with type 2 diabetes were given 900 mg of CRLA daily for 6 weeks, followed by 1,200 mg of CRLA daily for an additional 6 weeks.

In 15 patients, the mean plasma fructosamine concentration was reduced from 313 to 283 micromol/L(P<0.05) after 12 weeks of treatment with CRLA.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCRLA increased the plasma concentration of LA over time in healthy subjects, and CRLA was safe, well tolerated, and effective in reducing plasma fructosamine in patients with type 2 diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["10836205", "10926311", "10595592", "10656234", "10594485", "10499773", "10480774", "10468203", "10401614", "10072479", "10333946", "9876998", "9285502", "9378235", "9051389", "9094201", "9421684", "8817248", "8858282", "7575750", "7649494", "14854913"], "inbound_citations": ["34939534", "34122657", "32054355", "32344198", "30696240", "30612488", "29731703", "28724177", "25893270", "25897356", "25821809", "25502159", "25380523", "23768254", "22374556", "22107734", "21520997", "23148152", "20307398", "20199220", "19126754", "19019027", "18494549", "18221433", "19021026", "19509460", "18069903", "17496361", "17309390", "15936776", "15998259"], "label": "0"}

Urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (ACR) was measured in a 52-week, open-label, cardiac safety study comparing rosiglitazone and glyburide. Patients were randomised to treatment with rosiglitazone 4 mg b.i.d. or glyburide. ACR was measured at baseline and after 28 and 52 weeks of treatment. Statistically significant reductions from baseline in ACR were observed in both treatment groups at week 28. By week 52, only the rosiglitazone group showed a significant reduction from baseline. Similar results were observed for the overall study population and for the subset of patients with baseline microalbuminuria. For patients with microalbuminuria at baseline, reductions in ACR did not correlate strongly with reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin, or fasting plasma glucose, but showed strong correlation with changes in mean 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressure for rosiglitazone-treated patients (deltaACR vs deltamean 24-h systolic blood pressure, r=0.875; deltaACR vs deltamean 24-h diastolic blood pressure, r=0.755; P < 0.05 for both). No such correlation was observed for glyburide-treated patients. In conclusion, rosiglitazone treatment was associated with a decrease in urinary albumin excretion. These findings suggest a potential beneficial effect of rosiglitazone in the treatment or prevention of renal and vascular complications of type II diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["12719295", "12401757", "12163427", "11232013", "11023140", "10831180", "10871202", "10725292", "10624787", "10690319", "10389852", "10226869", "10085162", "10096775", "10096778", "9732337", "9742977", "9703335", "9597373", "9217873", "8908388", "8572838", "7589828", "7564792", "8359108"], "inbound_citations": ["36922653", "36359869", "35308207", "34015285", "33099742", "32450102", "31342643", "29486908", "30175243", "29686650"], "label": "0"}

Data had to be reported in at least three quantiles or intervals so that the nature of the relationship between glucose and cardiovascular events (i.e., linear or nonlinear) could be explored, and to ensure that any incremental cardiovascular risk was consistent across quantiles or intervals.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnalyzed studies comprised 95,783 people (94% male) who had 3,707 cardiovascular events over 12.4 years (1,193,231 person-years). Studies reporting fasting glucose levels (n = 6), 2-h glucose levels (n = 7), 1-h glucose levels (n = 5), and casual glucose levels (n = 4) were included. The glucose load used varied from 50 to 100 g. The highest glucose interval for most studies included glucose values in the diabetic range. The relationship between glucose levels and the risk of a cardiovascular event was modeled for each study and the beta-coefficients were combined. Compared with a glucose level of 4.2 mmol/l (75 mg/dl), a fasting and 2-h glucose level of 6.1 mmol/dl (110 mg/dl) and 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) was associated with a relative cardiovascular event risk

Participants were part of a larger multicenter study on the effects of acarbose on glucose control in diabetes. A total of 63 type 1 diabetic patients, age 28 +/- 9 years, BMI 24 +/- 0.6 kg/m2, after a 4-week run-in period on their habitual diet, were randomized to either an HF (n = 32) or a low-fiber (LF) diet (n = 31) for 24 weeks. The two diets, composed exclusively of natural foodstuffs, were weight-maintaining and, aside from their fiber content, were similar for all nutrients. At the end of the run-in period and the dietary treatment, fasting blood samples for the measurement of plasma cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, and HbA(1c) were collected. A daily glycemic profile was performed on a day in which the participants had consumed a standard menu representative of their treatment diet (HF or LF).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 63 study subjects, 29 in the HF group (91%) and 25 in the LF group (81%) completed the study Compared with the LF diet, the HF diet after 24 weeks decreased both mean daily blood glucose concentrations (P < 0.05) and number of hypoglycemic events (P < 0.01).

They received single 10-min preprandial doses of 120 mg nateglinide, 0.5 or 2 mg repaglinide, or placebo or 1 min preprandially of 2 mg repaglinide. Subjects received each dose only once, 48 h apart. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic assessments were performed from 0 to 12 h postdose.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNateglinide induced insulin secretion more rapidly than 2 and 0.5 mg repaglinide and placebo (10 min preprandial), with mean rates of insulin rise of 2.3, 1.3, 1.15, and 0.8 microU x ml(-1) x min(-1), respectively, over the 0- to 30-min postmeal interval. After peaking, insulin concentrations decreased rapidly in the nateglinide-treated group and were similar to placebo within 2 h postdose. After 2 mg repaglinide, peak insulin concentrations were delayed and returned to baseline more slowly than with nateglinide treatment. Nateglinide treatment produced lower average plasma glucose concentrations in the 0- to 2-h postdose interval than either dose of repaglinide and placebo (P < 0.05 vs. 0.5 mg repaglinide and placebo). Plasma glucose concentrations returned more rapidly to predose levels with nateglinide treatment than with either dose of repaglinide. Treatment with repaglinide produced a sustained hypoglycemic effect up to 6 h postdose.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this single-dose study in nondiabetic volunteers, nateglinide provided a more rapid and shorter-lived stimulation of insulin secretion than repaglinide, resulting in lower meal-related glucose excursions. If similar results are observed in diabetes, nateglinide may produce a more physiological insulin secretory response with the potential for a reduced risk of postabsorptive hypoglycemia.", "outbound_citations": ["10773014", "10720043", "10868832", "11563410", "9892228", "9405900", "15989662", "9145209", "9117089", "9028717", "8894500", "1770103", "1906797", "2524334"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

The effects of a meal on the oral bioavailability and pharmacodynamic actions of nateglinide were investigated. Twelve healthy male subjects completed this randomized, single\u2010dose, four\u2010way crossover study in which each subject received a 60 mg dose of nateglinide 10 minutes before the start of and immediately after a high\u2010fat breakfast meal. In addition, each subject received a single 30 and 60 mg dose of nateglinide under fasting conditions. Plasma and urine concentrations of nateglinide were determined by an HPLC method while plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured by standard immunoassay methods. Compared to the fasted state, administration of nateglinide 10 minutes before the meal was associated with an increase in the rate of absorption (12% increase in Cmax and 52% decrease in tmax), while there was no significant effect on the extent of absorption (AUC). Alternatively, when nateglinide was given after the meal, a food effect was observed that was characterized by a decrease in the rate of absorption: 34% decrease in Cmax and a 22% increase in tmax but no significant effect on AUC. Nateglinide was rapidly eliminated with plasma t1/2 = 1.4 hours. Its plasma renal clearance, 20.7 ml/min, appears to be due mostly to active tubular secretion. However, only 13% to 14% of the dose is recovered as nateglinide in the urine. The 30 and 60 mg tablets were dose proportional in terms of both AUC and Cmax; both tmax and t1/2 were dose independent. Regardless of timing, the combination of a meal and nateglinide produced a larger increase in insulin levels than did nateglinide alone. Meal\u2010related glucose excursions were eliminated when nateglinide was taken prior to the meal.

Following OGTT, plasma glucose, GIP, GLP-1NT, and GLP-1CT in type 2 patients increased more markedly than in controls, despite the lower response of insulin.

We performed oral (OGTT) and intravenous (FSIGT) glucose tolerance tests. The OGTT showed that C and E were normotolerant, while D had a markedly reduced glucose tolerance. This was also confirmed in the FSIGT where the glucose tolerance index (KG) was 0.6 +/- 0.1% min-1 in D vs 1.8 +/- 0.2 in C and 1.5 +/- 0.2 in E (p < 0.0002). Total insulin area of D and the overall insulin delivery were not different from those of the control groups. The early phase area was instead significantly reduced (0.19 +/- 0.02 mU min/mL vs 0.61 +/- 0.06 of C and 0.46 +/- 0.06 of E, p < 0.001) given the reduction in the dynamic first-phase insulin delivery (0.86 +/- 0.17 min(microU/mL)/(mg/dL) vs 3.95 +/- 0.61 in C (p < 0.005) and 2.61 +/- 0.66 (p < 0.001) in E). SI of D was 3.4 +/- 0.4 10(-4) min-1/(microU/mL), not different from that of C (4.7 +/- 0.6) and E (3.5 +/- 0.2).

This study compares the effects of the two enteral nutritional formulae in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes) treated with sulfonylurea or insulin. Fifty-two type 2 diabetes patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the two enteral formulae. Test enteral formula breakfast (250 cc) were consumed at approximately 0900 h after routine medications (insulin or oral agents) had been taken. Venous blood samples were obtained during fasting, before medication, and at 30 and 120 min after the start of the meal. The glycemic response of patients to the HCF was significantly greater than to RCF, but lower than in the sulfonyl type 2 diabetes treated groups. The incremental glucose response was within acceptable levels except in insulin treatment type 2 diabetes patients given HCF. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide responses were higher in HCF than RCF groups. Two-factor analysis of variance on mean increments of blood glucose and C-peptide from basal levels to 30 min show the type of enteral nutrition as the main factor (P = 0.0010 and P = 0.0005, respectively). The RCF formula supplies 50.0% of energy as fat and 33.3% as carbohydrates, so it may be a ketogenic diet. It was found that both ketone bodies were higher after RCF than after HCF ingestion, but without statistical significance. We conclude that the partial replacement of complex digestible carbohydrates with monounsaturated fatty acids in the enteral formulae for supplementation of oral diet may improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The long-term effects of enteral diets high in monounsaturated fatty acids need further evaluation in patients with type 2 diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["8642888", "8604657", "7554586", "7848401", "8026287", "8174444", "8117360", "8077331", "1461145", "1397701", "1421778", "1327177", "1738224", "1959473", "1877514", "2402159", "2164134", "2502921", "2514507", "3045553", "7113763", "344113", "4453802", "4997333"], "inbound_citations": ["32640608", "32222291"], "label": "0"}

This effect may imply harmful cardiovascular effects of glibenclamide when used under conditions of ischaemia in patients with Type II diabetes. Acarbose is not associated with effects on the cardiovascular system, because the drug is not absorbed from the bowel. Therefore we hypothesized that treatment of Type II diabetes patients with glibenclamide will impair the vasodilator function of K(ATP) opening, unlike treatment with acarbose. A double-blind randomized cross-over study in 12 patients with Type II diabetes was performed to compare the effects of glibenclamide with those of acarbose on the vasodilator responses to K(ATP) channel opening in the forearm vascular bed. The study consisted of two periods: 8 weeks of treatment with orally administered glibenclamide (10 mg x day(-1)) followed by 8 weeks of treatment with acarbose (300 mg x day(-1)), or vice versa. At the end of each treatment period, forearm blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography) in response to intra-arterially administered diazoxide, acetylcholine and dipyridamole and to forearm ischaemia was measured. The diazoxide-mediated increase in the forearm blood flow ratio (infused/control arm) was significantly less pronounced after glibenclamide than after acarbose (290 +/- 58% and 561 +/- 101% respectively; P<0.0005). Forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine, dipyridamole and forearm ischaemia were similar during glibenclamide and acarbose treatment.

Prandial glucose regulation is aimed at restoring the first-phase insulin response that follows consumption of a meal, which is missing in patients with Type 2 diabetes. After repaglinide administration, the resulting insulin profile reflects that of healthy individuals more closely, providing tighter glycaemic control and reducing the risk of hypoglycaemic events. Repaglinide is quickly absorbed and rapidly eliminated through biliary excretion, making it suitable for use in patients with renal impairment. It appears in the bloodstream within 15 to 30 min of dosing, stimulating short-term insulin release from the pancreatic b-cells by binding to a unique site on the \u03b2-cell membrane. Rapid elimination ensures that postprandial insulin levels quickly return to preprandial levels as the high prandial glucose level subsides. Repaglinide is given on a \u2018one meal, one tablet; no meal, no tablet\u2019 basis. It is particularly effective in patients who have not previously been treated with an oral antidiabetic agent, significantly reducing glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels by 1.6%. It also offers increased mealtime flexibility and safety, compared with other oral antidiabetic agents. As a result of the short plasma half-life and lack of accumulation of repaglinide with repeated dosing, the risk of between-meal and nocturnal hypoglycaemia is substantially reduced compared with other oral antidiabetic agents. Repaglinide acts synergistically with metformin, consistently improving glycaemic control in patients who were insufficiently controlled by metformin alone. Results from recent studies have shown similar synergistic effects with neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH)-insulin or troglitazone.", "outbound_citations": ["10522841", "10522839", "10522838", "10499883", "10426375", "10372242", "10199798", "10363735", "10097930", "10369424", "9892231", "9877000", "9742976", "9549452", "9540016", "9519738", "9421381", "9283692", "8971078", "8971080", "8894500", "8826962", "7671557", "8508612", "8387089", "1737544", "3283554", "3865878", "4555783"], "inbound_citations": ["34696808", "33998049", "31953901", "31089348", "29723439", "27435474", "26053313", "25758123", "19900993", "17391168", "17953471", "16710643"], "label": "1"}

Initially described by Stein and Leventhal in 1935 [2] as a combination of polycystic ovaries, amenorrhoea, hirsutism and obesity, it has been defined in different ways over the years. Finally, in 1990 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) established the new diagnostic criteria for this disorder, which are based on the presence of hyperandrogenism and chronic oligo-anovulation, with the exclusion of other causes of hyperandrogenism such as non-classical adrenal steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency, hyperprolactinemia, or androgen-secreting neoplasm [3]. In the past decade it became apparent that the syndrome is also associated with metabolic disturbances. Burghen and colleagues [1] in 1980 first reported that women with PCOS had higher basal and glucose-stimulated insulin levels than weight-matched controls. Subsequently, a number of studies worldwide [4, 5] demonstrated that hyperinsulinemia and insulin-resistance are common features of a large number of patients affected by PCOS. In addition to hyperinsulinemia and insulinresistance, altered first-phase insulin secretion, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension and impaired fibrinolysis have also been described in PCOS [6, 7, 8]. This cluster of metabolic disturbances places women with PCOS at a high risk for the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes and implies that the PCOS by itself may not be considered just a hyperandrogenic disorder exclusively related to young and fertile-age women, but a syndrome which may have some health implications later in life.", "outbound_citations": ["1563578", "11875250", "11397859", "11344202", "11161134", "10831553", "10946879", "10453357", "10468913", "10024076", "9920077", "9408743", "9385530", "9363702", "9215280", "8784087", "8687515", "8768842", "8680455", "8773746", "8772557", "8772555", "7593446", "7673399", "7600112", "7615824", "7723677", "7623362", "7825639", "7955458", "8175959", "8177055", "8375585", "8348699", "8334748", "1559293", "1773700", "2221057", "2670645", "6223044", "7350174", "382871"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Adverse effect profiles differ markedly between the sulphonylureas and biguanides, reflecting differences in chemical structure and mode of action. Sulphonylureas are generally well tolerated, although pharmacokinetic differences between these agents have important clinical implications. The main adverse effect associated with sulphonylureas is hypoglycaemia. This effect is a predictable consequence of the principal pharmacological effect of these drugs, i.e. sensitisation of the islet beta-cell to glucose, resulting in enhanced endogenous insulin secretion. Sulphonylurea-induced suppression of hepatic glucose production may cause profound and protracted hypoglycaemia, especially in elderly patients, in individuals with intercurrent illnesses and reduced caloric intake, or when taken in combination with other compounds with hypoglycaemic potential, e.g. alcohol (ethanol). Sulphonylureas with a longer duration of action, notably chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (glyburide), are more liable to induce serious hypoglycaemia, particularly when drug elimination is reduced by renal impairment. Other drugs such as salicylates may potentiate the actions of sulphonylureas, thereby increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Biguanide therapy is associated with alterations in lactate homeostasis which under certain clinical circumstances may result in fatal lactic acidosis. Phenformin is associated with a markedly greater risk of lactic acidosis than metformin. Phenformin has been withdrawn in many countries for this reason. All biguanides must be avoided in patients with renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction and cardiac failure--conditions where drug accumulation or disordered lactate metabolism may predispose to lactic acidosis. Phenformin should not be given to individuals who exhibit a severe, genetically conferred hepatic defect of hydroxylation which impedes metabolism of this drug. Less seriously, the biguanides are associated with a relatively high incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit compliance. Acarbose, a competitive inhibitor of intestinal alpha-glucosidases, has recently been introduced. In contrast to the sulphonylureas and biguanides, acarbose has not been associated with life-threatening adverse effects. This reflects the low systemic absorption of the drug and, predictably, its principal unwanted effects are gastrointestinal disturbances resulting from iatrogenic carbohydrate malabsorption.", "outbound_citations": ["8082525", "7903785", "7903784", "8112499", "8261749", "8458189", "8445035", "8422773", "1387073", "1600835", "1611838", "1600834", "1551316", "1838063", "1954810", "2044434", "2209342", "2192848", "2677730", "2695959", "2567896", "2500402", "2702912", "2645125", "2722133", "2672051", "3286363", "2968877", "3129103", "2967151", "2964327", "3301149", "3593625", "3552795", "3091170", "3083989", "4078865", "2951106", "3890480", "3865878", "6430443", "6641100", "6414303", "6336343", "6443808", "7028548", "7388472", "6766289", "678924", "589351", "930951", "838166", "1175342", "4213123", "4742454", "4109946", "4181737", "4169605", "1280577", "7049798", "387488", "6706043", "69109", "3286212", "3936738", "7833731", "6989693", "1444694", "6411511", "1451945", "1935599", "7021124", "3075901", "631459", "3289989", "7635034", "3075902", "6847752", "2651086", "3030623", "3075896", "3935560", "6350078", "344119", "2065696", "404205", "1435883"], "inbound_citations": ["36077003", "35806265", "35398707", "35112779", "34006565", "34054542", "31748838", "31316549", "29498478", "30077092", "30181847", "28322845", "29345438", "27579542", "27164115", "26037130", "27214299", "26335661", "25840942", "25483062", "25587316", "24948564", "24896141", "24741335", "24510630", "23621352", "22721394", "22940189", "22908576", "15200348", "10576527", "5430471", "21236717", "21270651", "21281021", "21241070", "21275442", "20942513", "21354873", "21164223", "20362759", "20378050", "19481899", "19843053", "19580949", "19522462", "19464426", "18983988", "19196370", "19902987", "19817501", "19015566", "18728386", "18398806", "17984746", "17658960", "17102161", "17044809", "16968950", "16893337", "16914074", "16415668", "16219016", "16219009", "16515237", "16002175", "16125352", "15963007", "15878899", "15743682", "15735184"], "label": "1"}

A soft gelatin capsule containing PEG 400, PEG 4000, Tween 20 and glycerin was prepared as a formulation that may accelerate dissolution of gliclazide. The in vitro dissolution of gliclazide at pH 7.2 was identical for the soft capsule and conventional tablets, Diamicron and Diberin. However, at pH 1, 2 and 4.0 the dissolution from the soft capsule was more rapid compared to the tablets. When bioavailability parameters were compared following oral administration of the soft capsule and Diamicron to 16 healthy Korean male subjects, the parameters representing the amount of adsorption (i.e. the area under the serum gliclazide concentration vs. time curve up to 24 h, AUC24, and the peak serum concentration Cmax) were not statistically different for both formulations. However, the time required to reach the peak (Tmax) was significantly shorter for the soft capsule than for the Diamicron. Our results, therefore, indicate that a rapid elevation of serum gliclazide concentration following oral administration of a formulation can be achieved by accelerating the in vitro dissolution of gliclazide from the formulation into the acidic buffers. Thus, the rate of gastrointestinal absorption of gliclazide appears to be dependent on its in vivo dissolution rate in gastric fluid. A soft capsule containing a PEG 400 suspension of gliclazide appears to be an appropriate formulation for accelerating the dissolution.", "outbound_citations": ["7833494", "8111803", "7691511", "1478992", "1794262", "2614701"], "inbound_citations": ["36999176", "36145695", "33929614", "32510859", "31692384", "31646950", "30802549", "26883263", "26100737", "25767316", "25378281", "24829616", "23305705", "22382730", "21874525", "21959805", "21181508", "20196643", "19539757", "18478549", "19319688", "18204476", "17507189", "17454041", "16107306"], "label": "0"}

This article reviews the diagnosis and classification of type 2 diabetes, describes the multiple defects in glucose metabolism associated with the disease, and discusses the various pharmacologic options for achieving glycemic control in these patients. The information in this review was compiled through a search of MEDLINE. Search terms included but were not limited to type 2 diabetes and antihyperglycemic agents. In addition, abstracts were identified using the Web sites of diabetes-related professional organizations. Two pathophysiologic mechanisms, insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, are usually present at diagnosis in type 2 diabetes. Several studies have shown that combination therapy with antihyperglycemic agents having different mechanisms of action provides greater efficacy than treatment with single agents. Current research suggests that early aggressive treatment with combination therapy achieves glycemic control at lower doses and with fewer side effects than monotherapy with either component.", "outbound_citations": ["12502614", "12324981", "11118018", "11023153", "10977060", "10938048", "10963823", "11242607", "10773014", "10720043", "10522837", "10706327", "10510952", "10525654", "10877745", "10359389", "10436254", "10333910", "9742977", "9715377", "9691098", "9571335", "9454524", "9538975", "8960830", "8592553", "7589820", "7623903", "7587918", "7860750", "8035658", "8157701", "8366922", "8412779", "1401068", "1727062", "1955512", "2033819", "2661589", "760352", "13937884"], "inbound_citations": ["33781459", "31958487", "28628926", "24059307", "24741644", "24294470", "24146442", "21111037", "19917523", "19422900", "18413196", "15815569"], "label": "1"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a multicenter ambulatory randomized double-masked parallel comparison. There were 208 subjects with secondary failure to sulfonylureas who took glimepiride titrated to 8 mg b.i.d. for 8 weeks; 145 subjects with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 180\u2013300 mg/dl (10\u201316.7 mmol/1) on this treatment were randomized to placebo plus insulin (PI) or glimepiride plus insulin (GI) for 24 weeks. A dosage of 70/30 insulin before supper was titrated, seeking fasting capillary blood glucose (FBG) 120 mg/dl (6.7 mmol/1), equivalent to FPG 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/1). Outcome measures included FPG, HbA1c, insulin dosage, weight, serum insulin and lipids, and adverse events. RESULTS FPG and HbA1c were equivalent at baseline: 261 vs. 250 mg/dl (14.5 vs. 13.9 mmol/1), and 9.9 vs. 9.7%. At 24 weeks, the FPG target was achieved in both groups (136 vs. 138 mg/dl, 7.6 vs. 7.6 mmol/1), and HbA1c values were equal (7.7 vs. 7.6%). However, with GI, control improved faster and fewer subjects dropped out (3 vs. 15%, P < 0.01), and less insulin was needed (49 vs. 78 U/d, P < 0.001). The outcomes were alike in other respects. No subject had severe hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS Injection of 70/30 insulin before supper safely restored glycemic control of type 2 diabetes not controlled by glimepiride alone.

The study will report in 1998, when the median duration from randomization will be 11 years. This report is on the efficacy of therapy over 6 years of follow-up and the overall incidence of diabetic complications. Subjects comprised 4,209 newly diagnosed type II diabetic patients who after 3 months' diet were asymptomatic and had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 6.0\u201315.0 mmol/l. The study consists of a randomized controlled trial with two main comparisons: 1) 3,867 patients with 1,138 allocated to conventional therapy, primarily with diet, and 2,729 allocated to intensive therapy with additional sulfonylurea or insulin, which increase insulin supply, aiming for FPG <6 mmol/l; and 2) 753 obese patients with 411 allocated to conventional therapy and 342 allocated to intensive therapy with metformin, which enhances insulin sensitivity. In the first comparison, in 2,287 subjects studied for 6 years, intensive therapy with sulfonylurea and insulin similarly improved glucose control compared with conventional therapy, with median FPG at 1 year of 6.8 and 8.2 mmol/l, respectively (P < 0.0001). and median HbA1c of 6.1 and 6.8%, respectively (P < 0.0001). During the next 5 years, the FPG increased progressively on all therapies (P < 0.0001) with medians at 6 years in the conventional and intensive groups, FPG 9.5 and 7.8 mmol/l, and HbA1c 8.0 and 7.1%, respectively. The glycemic deterioration was associated with progressive loss of \u03b2-cell function. In the second comparison, in 548 obese subjects studied for 6 years, metformin improved glucose control similarly to intensive therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin. Metformin did not increase body weight or increase the incidence of hypoglycemia to the same extent as therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin. A high incidence of clinical complications occurred by 6-year follow-up.

We performed a randomised, controlled trial allocating patients treated with diet and oral antihyperglycaemic agents to treatment with glibenclamide or insulin to achieve HbAlc levels under 7.5%. We included 36 subjects with established NIDDM of more than 2 years' duration. Mean HbAlc levels were significantly reduced in patients allocated to insulin treatment from 9.1 +/- 1.4% before the start to 7.8 +/- 1.3% (p < 0.05) after 1 year, and did not change significantly thereafter throughout the study period. Mean HbAlc levels increased during the study in the patients allocated to glibenclamide treatment, and 11 of 18 patients had to be switched to insulin treatment due to increasing hyperglycaemia (HbAlc > 10%). Mean body weight increased in the subjects allocated to insulin by 7.2 +/- 4.1 kg during the study period. In conclusion, insulin was more effective than glibenclamide treatment in obtaining control over hyperglycaemia in these patients, and once improved, glycaemic control did not deteriorate over 42 months in the insulin-treated group. Two thirds of the patients allocated to glibenclamide treatment had to be given insulin due to inadequate glycaemic control.", "outbound_citations": ["8722048", "7589820", "7621997", "7797776", "7794379", "7729308", "7851075", "7619101", "8077888", "8077881", "1516497", "1516483", "1542270", "2182032", "2757059", "3283552", "3749450", "904548", "13875925"], "inbound_citations": ["33549676", "33311036", "27882816", "27071029", "26066789", "26222249", "23633364", "23594109", "22470171", "19509109", "16841232", "16501671", "15717881"], "label": "1"}

Clinical expression of the disorder requires both genetic and environmental factors. One theory concerning its etiology is that it is the result of the evolution of a thrifty genotype that had survival benefits in the past but is detrimental in the current environment. An opposing theory is that it represents an adult metabolic response to fetal malnutrition. Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes results from absolute or relative insulin deficiency. Most often relative insulin deficiency is attributable to an inability to adequately compensate for insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may be caused by a variety of genetic or metabolic factors. The most common etiological factor in insulin resistance is central obesity. Insulin resistance is associated with a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that include glucose intolerance, hypertension, a unique dyslipidemia, a procoagulant state, and an increase in macrovascular disease. Clinical intervention studies have demonstrated that reduction in the chronic microvascular and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes requires treatment of hyperglycemia to achieve hemoglobin A1c <7.0%, blood pressure </=130/80 mmHg, and plasma LDL-cholesterol </=2.6 mmol/L (</=100 mg/dL). Oral antihyperglycemic agents increase endogenous insulin secretion, decrease insulin resistance, or lower postprandial plasma glucose rise by delaying absorption of complex carbohydrates. Long-term glycemic control in type 2 diabetes requires progressive, stepwise, combination treatment with oral agents and eventually combination treatment with oral agents and insulin.", "outbound_citations": ["11168965", "10189561", "9742977", "9715376", "9715377", "9635947", "9472859", "9399962", "9277397", "9158288", "8801446", "8875093", "7988310", "8247074", "13937884"], "inbound_citations": ["36947700", "36618551", "36043003", "35651332", "35310942", "34689672", "33889388", "32987447", "32908532", "32983730", "32283758", "35497611", "31538345", "31438580", "29650791", "29476414", "29373526"], "label": "0"}

Patients included were type 2 diabetic outpatients, 40-70 years of age, treated by diet alone or oral anti-diabetic drugs. Endpoint criteria evaluated were HbA1, blood glucose and plasma insulin (at fasting, and 1 and 2 h after a test meal). At each visit, a clinical examination was performed, and a questionnaire on side effects and associated symptoms was completed. The dose was reduced by half in the case of hypoglycaemia. The 216 patients were recruited in 5 centres [Shanghai (1) = 48, Shanghai (2) = 40, Beijing = 40, Canton = 42, Chengdu = 46 and randomized into treatment groups A, B, C, D (56, 56, 50 and 54 respectively). Eleven patients were withdrawn for administrative reasons. In patients treated with glibenclamide, a significant increase in weight and insulinaemia was observed, together with a significant decrease in blood glucose values; in those receiving TCT, blood glucose values were significantly decreased only 2 h after the test meal. A synergistic effect on blood glucose was observed when both treatments were given. Hypoglycaemia occurred in 19 patients (all in the two verum glibenclamide groups). This first multicentre controlled trial showed that the 3 Chinese plants tested were well-tolerated and effective in Type 2 diabetes as indicated by a significant synergistic effect in association with a sulfonylurea.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29670524"], "label": "0"}

Long-term control of blood glucose levels in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients will decrease the incidence and prolong the time until progression of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Our increased understanding of the pathophysiology behind type 2 diabetes has led to the development of many new agents that are aimed at treating the underlying insulin resistance and relative insulinopenia. The sulfonylureas as a group have been used for many years and act by stimulating insulin secretion. They are useful alone or as combination therapy with insulin or another oral hypoglycemic agent. The biguanides act by decreasing hepatic glucose production and by increasing peripheral insulin sensitivity. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitors act nonsystemically by blocking the metabolism of digested polysaccharides and therefore lowering the amount of carbohydrate absorbed in a meal. Benzoic acid derivatives act in a manner similar to that of sulfonylureas by enhancing pancreatic insulin production. They offer a shorter duration of action, lowering the risk of hypoglycemia. The thiazolidinediones increase peripheral insulin sensitivity and are effective as both monotherapy and combination therapy. Oral hypoglycemic agents, when properly administered, are very effective in controlling type 2 diabetes and preventing long-term complications.", "outbound_citations": ["7734015", "8648655", "8829014", "8911977", "8911981", "9096989", "9184703", "9209206", "9516221", "9519738", "9561345", "9571333", "9652997", "9652998", "9727881"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

In a single-blinded cross-over design vs. placebo, one 30 mg tablet gliquidone was administered 15 min before breakfast. Concomitant to the measurement of glucose and insulin, the gliquidone plasma levels of 20 subjects were determined by a new specific liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay method with fluorescence detection, and the pharmacokinetic parameters calculated. Following the gliquidone administration, the mean plasma glucose profiles of the responders were up to 15% lower than with placebo (p < 0.005) between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., representing a duration of the blood sugar-lowering effect of 8 to 10 h. Insulin values were raised, with peaks over 40% higher, during or shortly after meals. Subsequently, the insulin levels returned to approximately the same levels obtained with placebo during the postprandial phase. Plasma concentrations of gliquidone showed pronounced interindividual variability. The mean maximum concentration in plasma Cmax was 0.65 microgram/ml, (range: 0.12-2.14 micrograms/ml, coefficient of variation (CV): 82%). The median time to reach maximum plasma concentrations tmax was 2.25 h (range: 1.25-4.75 h). The areas under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero time to infinity (AUC0-infinity) and the mean terminal elimination half-lives (t1/2 beta) were computed from those patients (N = 8) who exhibited at least five plasma levels above the limit of quantitation in the terminal log-linear phase using a two-compartment model: the mean AUC0-infinity was 5.1 micrograms.h/ml (range: 1.5-10.1 micrograms.h/ml, CV 56%). The dominant half-life t1/2 alpha derived from therapeutically relevant plasma levels of gliquidone (> 80 ng/ml) was approximately 1.2 h (range: 0.4-3.0 h. CV: 71%) and the mean terminal half-life t1/2 beta was approximately 8 h (range: 5.7-9.4 h, CV: 17%).

Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a long period of impaired glucose tolerance, a reversible metabolic state associated with increased prevalence of macrovascular complications. Thus, at the time of diagnosis, long-term complications have developed in almost one fourth of patients. Susceptibility to type 2 diabetes requires genetic (most likely polygenic) and acquired factors, and its pathogenesis involves an interplay of progressive insulin resistance and beta-cell failure. The ideal treatment of type 2 diabetes should reverse insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in most treated patients and prevent, delay, or reverse long-term complications. Current strategies are aimed at amelioration of insulin resistance (diet, exercise, weight loss, and metformin and troglitazone therapy), augmentation of insulin supply (sulfonylurea and insulin therapy), or limitation of postprandial hyperglycemia (acarbose therapy). Future therapies probably will target (1) insulin resistance, using a multifaceted approach; (2) hepatic glucose production, using gluconeogenesis inhibitors; (3) excess nonesterified fatty acid production, using lipolysis inhibitors; and (4) fat oxidation, using carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II inhibitors. Attempts also could be made to stimulate energy expenditure and increase nonoxidative glucose disposal by means of beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists. One promising strategy is an attack on multiple pathophysiological processes by combining antidiabetic agents with disparate mechanisms of action. Thus, we now have unprecedented resources for drug therapy for diabetes, with great opportunity for innovative combinations. It is hoped that these expanded choices will provide the tools necessary for a more efficient management of type 2 diabetes and prevention of its long-term complications.", "outbound_citations": ["9327978", "9129543", "9118772", "8922349", "8908379", "8875094", "8686710", "8596596", "8592553", "8572835", "8571133", "8718436", "8629660", "8554200", "8554205", "8554201", "8554206", "7502040", "7589828", "7589820", "7589821", "7586939", "7623903", "7623902", "7609750", "7609751", "7615786", "7789631", "7587918", "7733122", "7738178", "7537758", "7738205", "7716547", "7716548", "7716539", "7860750", "7712708", "7712705", "7734015", "7882832", "7958494", "7525563", "7935656", "7962519", "7848543", "7523453", "8070607", "8013748", "8062602", "8121460", "8163660", "8132752", "8276779", "8262307", "7906882", "8413456", "8263034", "8405713", "8227324", "8366922", "8100835", "8487827", "8462390", "8433729", "8450063", "8422777", "7678183", "8428713", "1478035", "1406860", "1397716", "1357346", "1326453", "1365828", "1396017", "1499871", "1512357", "1511566", "1600836", "1600838", "1600834", "1349655", "1560802", "1733810", "1547676", "1345889", "1727716", "1717241", "1959473", "2057034", "1872379", "2052059", "1858869", "1936481", "2044434", "1828417", "1986018", "2227112", "2166697", "2374275", "2209341", "1973589", "2404714", "2575416", "2695369", "2676655", "2671740", "2570461", "2504569", "2664520", "2669517", "2757059", "2644145", "3069395", "3065001", "3283553", "2898268", "3292303", "3117062", "3027558", "3782431", "3552521", "3527829", "3510930", "3522142", "3882489", "3994695", "6090930", "6336343", "6336606", "6752642", "7043166", "7207655", "6985989", "7380107", "989537", "4364389", "4726369", "4926376", "4186029"], "inbound_citations": ["35273012", "34007967", "33381668", "31569571"], "label": "0"}

Several studies have suggested an association between magnesium (Mg) depletion and insulin resistance and/or reduction of insulin secretion in these cases. Our purpose was to evaluate if Mg supplementation (as magnesium oxide [MgO]) would improve metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied 128 patients with type 2 diabetes (32 men, 96 women, aged 30\u201369 years), treated by diet or diet plus oral antidiabetic drugs, in the Bahia Federal University Hospital, Brazil. Patients at risk for hypomagnesemia or with reduced renal function were excluded. This study was a clinical randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Patients received either placebo, 20.7 mmol MgO, or 41.4 mmol MgO daily(elementary Mg) for 30 days. Mg concentrations were measured in plasma, in mononuclear cells, and in 24-h urine samples. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1, and fructosamine were used as parameters of metabolic control. RESULTS Of the patients, 47.7% had low plasma Mg, and 31.1% had low intramononuclear Mg levels. Intracellular Mg in patients with diabetes was significantly lower than in the normal population (62 blood donors; 1.4 \u00b1 0.6 vs. 1.7 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcg/mg of total proteins). No correlation was found between plasma and intracellular Mg concentrations (r = \u22120.179; P = 0.15) or between Mg concentrations and glycemic control (r = \u22120.165; P = 0.12). Intracellular Mg levels were lower in patients with peripheral neuropathy than in those without (1.2 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcg/mg). Similar findings were observed in patients with coronary disease (1.0 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcg/mg). In the placebo and in the 20.7 mmol Mg groups, neither a change in plasma and intracellular levels nor an improvement in glycemic control were observed. Replacement with 41.4 mmol Mg tended to increase plasma, cellular, and urine Mg and caused a significant fall (4.1 \u00b1 0.8 to 3.8 \u00b1 0.7 mmol/1) in fructosamine (normal, 1.87\u20132.87 mmol/1). CONCLUSIONS Mg depletion is common in poorly controlled patientswith type 2 diabetes, especially in those with neuropathy or coronary disease. More prolonged use of Mg in doses that are higher than usual is needed toestablish its routine or selective administration in patients with type 2 diabetes to improve control or prevent chronic complications.", "outbound_citations": ["7714114", "7714113", "7729296", "8200955", "8062625", "8264519", "1516501", "1727737", "2041895", "2662695", "2651054", "3665095", "3956882", "3807425", "4012290", "3971556", "6802656", "652004", "5186833"], "inbound_citations": ["36638933", "36741996", "36471364", "36408199", "36093068", "35989402", "35811985", "35559000", "35045911", "34836329", "34277971", "33665494", "35368816", "32960105", "32045781", "31979560", "31758631", "31650393", "30971596", "30835085", "30587761", "30544774", "30430111", "30200431", "34860982", "29393871", "29387426", "28150351", "33442083", "28464014", "27707767", "27530471", "28140318", "27329332", "26449610", "26919891", "26865651", "26689794", "27439768", "25974209", "25520013", "26675817", "25974209", "25540137", "25247020", "25405132", "24484939", "25238470", "24002422", "23657239", "23226651", "25340105", "22404119", "23393691", "22198525", "21298562", "18235082", "19618003", "19658275", "19225116", "19124169", "19076553", "18488152", "23105708", "17916960", "17645588", "17616498", "17187968", "17495189", "17699436", "17309390", "17229895", "17229898", "17093158", "16978367", "16690176", "16417942", "16307847", "15925015"], "label": "0"}

In some animal species, myocardial preconditioning appears to be due to activation of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The role played by KATP channels in preconditioning in humans remains unknown. The aim of this study was to establish whether glibenclamide, a selective KATP channel blocker, abolishes the ischemic preconditioning observed in humans during coronary angioplasty following repeated balloon inflations. Methods and ResultsTwenty consecutive patients undergoing one-vessel coronary angioplasty were randomized to receive 10 mg oral glibenclamide or placebo. Sixty minutes after glibenclamide or placebo administration, patients were given an infusion of 10% dextrose (8 mL/min) to correct glucose plasma levels or, respectively, an infusion of saline at the same infusion rate. Thirty minutes after the beginning of the infusion, both patient groups underwent coronary angioplasty. The mean values (\u00b1 1 SD) of ST-segment shifts on the surface 12-lead ECG and the intracoronary ECG were measured at the end of the first and second balloon inflations, both 2 minutes long. In glibenclamide-treated patients, the mean ST-segment shift during the second balloon inflation was similar to that observed during the first inflation (23\u00b1 13 versus 20\u00b18 mm, P=NS), and the severity of cardiac pain was greater (55\u00b121 versus 43\u00b123 mm on a scale of 0 to 100, P<.05). Conversely, in placebo-treated patients the mean ST-segment shift during the second inflation was less than that during the first inflation (9\u00b15 versus 23\u00b113 mm, P<.001), as was the severity of cardiac pain (15\u00b115 versus 42\u00b119 mm, P<.01). Blood glucose levels were significantly reduced 60 minutes after glibenclamide compared with those at baseline (53\u00b19 versus 102\u00b110 mg/100 mL, P<.001) in the glibenclamide group; however, before coronary angioplasty, blood glucose levels increased to 95\u00b119 mg/100 mL, a value similar to that found in placebo group (96\u00b111 mg/100 mL, P=NS).

Plasma glucose, radioimmunoassay insulin, and nateglinide were measured at baseline and for a further 180 min.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe time-averaged 180-min postdose mean decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration was greater after nateglinide (1.8 mmol/l; 95% CI 1.5-2.0) than after placebo (0.7 mmol/l; 95% CI 0.3-1.2) (P < 0.001). Hypoglycemia did not develop in any of the subjects. Insulin concentrations increased 1.5-, 1.8-, and 1.9-fold with the 60-, 120-, and 180-mg doses, respectively (P < 0.001), peaking approximately 30 min after the dose. Nateglinide concentrations peaked after approximately 30 min, decreasing to 21% of peak by 180 min. In the meal test, the mean increase (2.9 mmol/l, 2.3-3.6) in plasma glucose over 180 min after placebo was reduced by 1.8 mmol/l (P < 0.001) with the two higher doses of nateglinide.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA single dose of nateglinide administered to diet-treated type 2 diabetic patients with fasting hyperglycemia increased insulin secretion and reduced fasting glucose without hypoglycemia. Administered 5 min before a meal, nateglinide reduced the postprandial glucose excursion by 64%. With its rapid onset and short duration of action, nateglinide is a promising oral prandial therapy in type 2 diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["10773014", "10784228", "10720043", "10565863", "10491749", "10372249", "9802740", "9742976", "9559882", "9105692", "9117089", "8596487", "7864093", "8119179", "1906797", "2738878", "2484976", "6778079", "565457"], "inbound_citations": ["33322540", "28618876", "28942740", "28989726", "26487791", "25974701", "25005331", "24403842", "24649052", "22995389", "23010558", "21801074", "19665640", "18946890", "18200800", "17298589", "16735959", "16532323", "16214362", "16002802", "15715888"], "label": "1"}

Forty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were on conventional insulin therapy (subcutaneous insulin therapy consisting of regular and NPH insulin, two times a day) were included in the study. They were randomized to double blind treatment with insulin in combination with gliclazide or acarbose for 6 months. For both groups, acceptable glycemic control was achieved at the end of study period. The mean HbA(1c) levels decreased from 8.32+/-0.26 to 7.13+/-0.18% in acarbose group and 8. 6+/-0.15 to 7.48+/-0.21% in the gliclazide group. The difference between groups was not significant (P 0.29). In the acarbose group, total cholesterol and LDL concentration decreased significantly while other parameters did not change. In the gliclazide group, HDL levels decreased significantly from 46.6+/-2.48 mg/dl to 41.3+/-2.09 mg/dl (P 0.001) BMI increased significantly from 27.60+/-1.21 kg/m(2) to 28.69+/-1.26 kg/m(2).

In the acarbose group, there were no significant differences between responders and nonresponders with respect to fasting and stimulated C-peptide, HbA(1c) levels and baseline BMI values. But in the gliclazide group, baseline BMI values were significantly higher in the nonresponding group compared to responders (P 0.02). In conclusion, combination of insulin with acarbose can be a good alternative for type 2 diabetic patients on insulin therapy; seems more beneficial than combination with gliclazide; may have advantage of achieving good glycemic control without increasing insulin dose and BMI; also may have the advantage of providing a decrease in LDL level, which are all important to prevent atherosclerosis.", "outbound_citations": ["9520910", "9369268", "9267146", "7751990", "7648802", "7557497", "8314013", "8495612", "8212978", "1387073", "1600834", "1280578", "1828656", "1872311", "1834486", "2044434", "1872309", "2209344", "2192852", "2192850"], "inbound_citations": ["30586591", "28685995"], "label": "0"}

For myocardial infarction, the reduction in risk (16% for a 0.9% decrease in HbA1c) was of borderline significance but corresponded closely to epidemiological predictions (14% decrease for a 1% drop in HbA1c) (2). These data demonstrated that neither insulin nor sulfonylureas, despite causing hyperinsulinemia and weight gain, have adverse effects on cardiovascular outcome. Glycemic control deteriorated continuously, however, even in intensively treated patients in the UKPDS (1).\n\nIn the UKPDS, the worsening of glycemic control has been attributed to the natural course of type 2 diabetes and lack of efficacy of current antihyperglycemic therapies (1). Insulin therapy consisted of a single injection of ultralente or isophane insulin. If the daily dose exceeded 14 U, regular insulin was added and home-glucose monitoring was encouraged (1). Combination therapy regimens with insulin and oral agents were not used. We now know that 14 U of long-acting insulin is insufficient to control fasting glycemia in most type 2 diabetic patients (3). Since 1977, when the UKPDS was started, several studies have tried to define the optimal insulin treatment regimen for type 2 diabetic patients. These studies are the focus of this review and include studies comparing insulin alone to combination therapy with insulin and sulfonylureas (subject to meta-analyses in 1991 and 1992) (4,5) and more recent trials using metformin, glitazones, or acarbose in insulin combination therapy regimens. They do not contain data on cardiovascular end points but only on surrogate markers of risk of micro- and macrovascular complications, mostly data on glycemia, body weight, insulin doses, lipids, and in a few studies, also accurate data on the frequency of hypoglycemias.\n\nAccording to a Medline search (1966\u20132000), \u2026", "outbound_citations": ["10938048", "10937510", "10937499", "10905483", "10580431", "10547208", "10547209", "10566566", "10484048", "10428734", "10372240", "10068412", "10230643", "10079680", "9892227", "9839094", "9868971", "9653594", "9686693", "9690059", "9589227", "9516220", "9649951", "9398709", "9357409", "8941458", "7587856", "7555561", "7587918", "7555472", "7734015", "8366922", "8325203", "1387073", "1516500", "1595776", "1828656", "2507265", "2499443", "3126626", "3129273", "3141099", "3127418", "3123116", "2890501", "3605188", "3106656", "3545931", "3516096", "3940908", "3919531", "3931537", "6439036", "6428120", "6629834", "7468572", "29812685"], "inbound_citations": ["36641115", "36050763", "34388350", "33865916", "33602190", "33551800", "31567175", "31692244", "31720743", "31159430", "30050287", "29686457", "29316236", "29110384"], "label": "1"}

Few data are available concerning their effects on metabolic parameters other than measures of glycemic control. In addition to assessing the effects of repaglinide and glimepiride on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, this study also examined the effects of these agents on 3 metabolic parameters known to be cardiovascular risk factors--lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and homocysteine (Hcy). This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted at a single center in Italy. Eligible patients were nonsmokers; had no hypertension or coronary heart disease; were taking no hypolipidemic drugs, diuretics, beta-blockers, or thyroxin; and had normal renal function. After an initial 4-week placebo washout period, patients were randomized to receive repaglinide 1 mg/d or glimepiride 1 mg/d. The dose of study drug was optimized over an 8-week titration period, which was followed by a 12-month treatment period. Measures of glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], fasting plasma glucose [FPG], postprandial plasma glucose [PPG], fasting plasma insulin [FPI], postprandial plasma insulin [PPI]) and the other metabolic parameters of interest were assessed after 6 and 12 months of treatment. One hundred twenty-four patients (63 women, 61 men) completed the study, 62 in each treatment group. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between groups. After 6 and 12 months of treatment, FPG levels and HbA1c values were significantly reduced from baseline in both groups (6 months, P < 0.05; 12 months, P < 0.01). After 6 months, PPG levels were significantly decreased only in the repaglinide group (P < 0.05 vs baseline); at 12 months, however, PPG levels were significantly reduced from baseline in both groups (P < 0.01 repaglinide, P < 0.05 glimepiride). No significant changes from baseline in FPI or PPI levels were seen in either group at 6 months, although FPI levels were significantly increased in the repaglinide group at 12 months (P < 0.05).

Repaglinide and glimepiride improved glycemic control and reduced levels of other metabolic parameters of interest in this population of patients with type 2 diabetes.

The rate of failure and the features of those who fail have been poorly described. To assess secondary failure rates of sulphonylureas, we report on the responses in 1305 patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 DM randomly allocated to therapy with either chlorpropamide or glibenclamide in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). These patients were initially treated by diet for 3 months and had a fasting plasma glucose >6 mmol l\u22121; mean age 53 (SD 9) years; BMI 26.8 (SD 5.0) kg m\u22122; and median fasting plasma glucose 9.1 (7.6\u201312.5 quartiles) mmol l\u22121. If their fasting plasma glucose subsequently rose above 15.0 mmol l\u22121, or they developed hyperglycaemic symptoms, additional hypoglycaemic therapy was given: metformin, ultratard insulin, and soluble insulin as required. By 6 years, 44 % had required additional therapy. Of those randomized to glibenclamide, 48 % required additional therapy by 6 years, compared with 40 % of those allocated to chlorpropamide (p < 0.01). 61 %, 39 %, and 23 %, respectively, of patients with fasting plasma glucose \u226510.0 mmol l\u22121, \u22657.8 mmol l\u22121 to <10.0 mmol l\u22121 and <7.8 mmol l\u22121 at randomization required additional therapy (p < 0.001). In the initial 3 years, non\u2010obese subjects (BMI <30 kg m\u22122) were more likely to require additional therapy than obese patients (BMI \u226530 kg m\u22122) (43 % vs 53 % at 6 years; p < 0.001). Modelled beta\u2010cell function showed that those with lower function were more likely to fail (p < 0.0001). Thus sulphonylureas fail as a therapeutic agent at rates which are dependent both on the phenotype at presentation and perhaps on the agent used initially. Higher failure rates were found in those with higher glucose concentrations, those who were younger, those with lower beta\u2010cell reserve and those randomized to glibenclamide compared with chlorpropamide. \u00a9 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37234549", "36828194", "36559020", "36520430", "36754495", "36255061", "35508700", "35586622", "35353540", "35196393", "35108433", "35212627", "35174618", "34758676", "34680107", "34542937", "34302636", "33987715", "33950400", "33837921", "33489216", "34680107", "32741645", "32543261", "32468916", "32489427", "32376986", "32203408", "31804738", "31772943", "31686879", "31251092", "31383366", "31616495", "31250216", "31190934", "30876392", "30173655", "30471177", "30360949", "29697198", "29880308", "29564716", "29542001", "29488154", "29302934", "29275961", "29260253", "28935388", "28509408", "27569728"], "label": "1"}

The median age was 72 years. Ninety-two patients suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus; 10 patients had type 1 diabetes mellitus. The median lowest blood glucose level was 1.77 mmol/L (32 mg/dL). Drug-induced hypoglycemic coma occurred in 99 patients out of the hospital, while 3 patients developed it during hospitalization. Drug-induced hypoglycemic coma occurred in patients undergoing treatment with insulin, glyburide, and combined therapy with insulin and glyburide, insulin and metformin, or glyburide and metformin. Ninety-three patients had at least 1 of the following risk factors: age older than 60 years, renal dysfunction, decreased intake of energy, and infection. Fourteen patients concomitantly received drugs that potentiated hypoglycemia. Forty patients responded to treatment within the first 12 hours, while 62 patients had protracted hypoglycemia of 12 to 72 hours' duration.

The subjects of our study had a mean age of 52.5 +/- 1.6 years, BMI of 28.5 +/- 0.7 kg/m2, diabetes duration of 9.1 +/- 1.8 years, and HbA1c of 7.0 +/- 0.8%.

The patients were asked to visit our outpatient clinic after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. At all times, blood pressure, microalbuminuria at rest, blood glucose, serum creatinine, serum picotamide, and creatinine clearance were measured; at baseline and after 6 and 12 months, all patients underwent submaximal physical exercise. After 6 months of picotamide, baseline and exercise-induced microalbuminuria were significantly decreased (up to one-third) as compared with the baseline and placebo level, with no further drops at month 12 of picotamide treatment. On placebo treatment, UAE at rest and after exercise was slightly increased compared with baseline values. The effects of picotamide occurred without significant side effects or changes in either blood pressure levels or glycometabolic control. Our study is the first long-term intervention trial in type 2 diabetes showing that an antithromboxane agent is able to decrease microalbuminuria, which in this disease is a dual marker of macro- and microangiopathy. Our findings suggest an important role for thromboxane in the pathophysiology of microalbuminuria in diabetes; moreover, we hypothesize that antithromboxane agents may have a place in the treatment/prevention of both macro- and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetic patients.", "outbound_citations": ["8366922", "2507264", "2493897", "3275846", "6738599", "6145027", "6242771", "6690964", "6472345", "6424441", "6123720", "6761893", "6783168", "7444853", "4134681"], "inbound_citations": ["35224730", "33929093", "33026598", "31390997"], "label": "0"}

An approximately threefold increased risk exists for all cardiovascular diseases [1, 2], and life expectancy is substantially reduced at all ages of disease presentation [3, 4]. Persons with diabetes presenting in their fourth or fifth decade of life have a twofold increased mortality compared with a control population [4, 5]. Microvascular diseases associated with diabetes are a major cause of blindness, renal failure, and amputations, all of which require expensive health care resources [6]. The continued high incidence of complications in patients with NIDDM [3, 7] indicates that the current therapeutic approach is inadequate for maintaining good health. At present, patients are often treated to prevent marked hyperglycemia when it induces symptoms such as thirst, whereas moderately raised blood glucose levels are often accepted. Mechanisms by which hyperglycemia might induce tissue damage have now been described, including glycosylation of tissues with formation of advanced glycation end products [8] and increased flux through the sorbitol pathway [9]. Reducing glucose concentrations in patients with NIDDM might be sensible [10]. However, it is uncertain whether hyperglycemia should be treated more intensivelywith diet, oral agents, or insulinto maintain near-normal glucose levels and prevent the onset of complications or whether these therapies have a neutral or even harmful effect [7]. Association of Blood Glucose Control with Diabetic Complications The epidemiologic association of glycemic levels with the risk for microvascular and macrovascular disease suggests that these two types of complications are affected by differing degrees of hyperglycemia. The development of diabetic retinopathy [11, 12] and nephropathy [12] mainly occurs when the fasting plasma glucose level is 7.8 mmol/L or higher. The increased risk for these specific diabetic complications when the glucose concentration rises above 7.8 mmol/L has led to it becoming the accepted defining criterion for diabetes [13]. On the other hand, a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease [14, 15] is associated with blood glucose levels at the upper end of the normal range (approximating a fasting plasma glucose level more than 6 mmol/L). The relevance of these data, however, remains controversial because of discordant results [16] and because other associated risk factors may be involved. For instance, patients with impaired glucose tolerance may have been at risk for heart disease because of associated dyslipidemia, hypertension, and raised insulin levels [17-19]. The prospective data in patients with NIDDM suggest that hyperglycemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease [4, 20], but insufficient data exist to determine whether there is a glycemic threshold for macrovascular disease. These data suggest that it may be necessary to obtain stricter control of diabetes to prevent cardiovascular disease than is necessary to prevent microvascular disease, but further studies are required. Previous Prospective Clinical Trials The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) studied 1441 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (mean age, 27 years) and showed that intensive therapy, which resulted in a mean hemoglobin A1c level of 7.1%, compared with conventional therapy, which resulted in a level of 9.0%, retards the progress of diabetic microvascular disease [21]. Whether such improved glucose control will be similarly beneficial in patients with NIDDM is unknown. A similar reduction in microvascular disease might be expected, but most of the complications in patients with NIDDM are from premature macrovascular, not microvascular, disease. The University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) studied 1027 patients with NIDDM (mean age, 53 years) and showed no benefit from improved glucose control induced by insulin, biguanide, or sulfonylurea therapy in preventing diabetic complications over 11 years of follow-up [7]. Potential Sting in the Tail of Pharmacologic Therapies The UGDP reported that a sulfonylurea (tolbutamide) [22] and a biguanide (phenformin) [23] appeared to increase cardiovascular mortality as compared with placebo (see Exogenous Insulin Administration and Cardiovascular Risk in NIDDM and IDDM). The results were statistically significant, but because this finding was unexpected and without a previous hypothesis, the study in effect introduced a new hypothesis rather than giving a confirmatory result. A mechanism by which sulfonylureas might increase the risk for cardiovascular disease is the presence in the myocardium of ATP (adenosine triphosphate)-sensitive potassium channels [24]. In theory, closure of these channels by sulfonylurea might prevent ischemia-induced vasodilatation and thus exacerbate ischemic episodes. In addition, ischemic pain might be lessened so that patients do not rest when ischemia becomes critical [25]. In a study done in rabbits, an interaction of sulfonylureas with ouabain induced cardiac arrhythmia with a first- but not second-generation sulfonylurea [26]. The UGDP results can possibly be explained by the use of the first-generation tolbutamide, and the results might not be applicable to second-generation sulfonylurea. Insulin therapy has been suggested to be potentially harmful, because when given subcutaneously it induces higher peripheral insulin levels than the usual endogenous secretion into the portal vein (see Do NIDDM and Cardiovascular Disease Share Common Antecendents?). This event occurs because the therapy needs to provide sufficiently high insulin levels in the portal vein to reduce excess hepatic glucose output. The high peripheral levels may lead to atherogenesis, as suggested by in vitro studies of the effect of raised insulin levels on the morphologic and biochemical responses of the arterial wall [27]. The epidemiologic associations in the general population of high fasting insulin levels with an increased risk for myocardial infarction [28, 29] are in accord with this theory, although the dyslipidemia and hypertension associated with high insulin levels, rather than high insulin levels per se, may account for the association [30]. The Uncertainty about Therapies The previous studies lend no support for the hypothesis that improved glucose control with currently available pharmaceutical agents helps to prevent the complications of NIDDM. The effect of available therapies on the development of cardiovascular disease is unknown, and the side effects of therapies may outweigh any potential gain from their blood glucose-lowering effect. United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) recruited 5102 patients with newly diagnosed NIDDM in 23 centers between 1977 and 1991 [31]. Of these patients, 4209 have been included in randomized, controlled trials of different therapies to determine whether patients with NIDDM can obtain clinical benefit from intensive glycemic control and whether sulfonylurea, metformin, and insulin therapies have specific advantages or disadvantages. The study will end in 1997 when the median duration from randomization will be 11 years (range, 6 to 20 y), and the results will be published in 1998. In 1991, the study was described [31]; the glucose control achieved by the allocated therapies over 3 and 6 years has also recently been described [32, 33]. This article outlines the study's progress, the efficacy of the different therapies over 9 years in improving glucose control, the side effects of the therapies, the natural history of the disease in terms of increasing glycemia, and the overall development of complications. It also compares the UKPDS with two previously reported studiesthe DCCT [21] and UGDP [7]both of which reported data for 9 years of follow-up. Methods Subjects The UKPDS recruited 5102 subjects who were 25 to 65 years old and who had newly diagnosed diabetes. The median age was 53 years, and the median fasting plasma glucose level was 11.9 mmol/L. Fifty percent of the patients were obese (> 120% of ideal body weight [34]), and 39% were hypertensive [31]. Ten percent were Asian-Indian, and 8% were Afro-Caribbean [35]. Approximately 50% of the patients already had an indication of diabetes-related tissue damage: 8% had an indication of cardiovascular disease [31], 37% had microaneurysm or more severe retinopathy in one eye, 18% had retinopathy in both eyes, and 18% had microalbuminuria (> 50 mg/L) [35]. The patients from different ethnic groups had a similar prevalence of preexisting heart disease, retinopathy, and microalbuminuria [35]. Initial Diet Therapy and Randomization During a 3-month run-in period, patients were given intensive dietary advice at monthly clinic visits and lost an average of 5 kg of body weight. Eighty-six percent became symptom free, but only 17% achieved a fasting plasma glucose level of less than 6.0 mmol/L [36]. In two thirds of these patients, the fasting plasma glucose level increased to more than 6.0 mmol/L within 3 years. Between 1978 and 1994, 4209 asymptomatic patients whose fasting plasma glucose level remained at or rose to between 6 and 15 mmol/L were randomly allocated to different therapies. Of the 4209 patients, 3513 were at the end of the initial 3 months of diet therapy; 696 had a fasting plasma glucose level of less than 6 mmol/L after the initial diet therapy but subsequently became hyperglycemic with a fasting plasma glucose level of more than 6 mmol/L. Once patients were entered in the formal therapeutic study, nonobese patients were randomly allocated to four groupsprimary therapy with diet, chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin therapy. Obese patients were randomly allocated to five groupsthe same four groups as nonobese patients and primary therapy with metformin.

We performed a crossover study in 50 NIDDM patients with secondary failure to glibenclamide by comparing the addition to sulphonylurea of either a low-dose bedtime NPH insulin or a t.i.d. oral metformin and by analyzing treatment efficacy in relation to patient and disease characteristics. Both combined therapies clearly improved glycaemic control. HbA1 c were similarly reduced by the addition of either bedtime NPH insulin (7.6+/-0.34 vs 8.7+/-0.35, p<0.01) or metformin (7.6+/-0.22 vs 8.6+/-0.31, p<0.01). Also fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and post-prandial plasma glucose (PPPG) significantly decreased (p<0.01) with both treatments. Bed-time NPH insulin was more effective on FPG reduction than metformin (-36+/-2% vs -25+/-2%, p<0.01); in contrast, metformin addition was more effective on PPPG reduction than bedtime NPH insulin addition (-30+/-2% vs 20+/-3%, p<0.01). Serum cholesterol was marginally but significantly decreased after metformin (5.49+/-0.19 vs 5.91 +/-0.18 mM, p<0.05) but not after NPH insulin. Body weight increase was significantly greater after insulin addition than after metformin (1.47+/-0.25 Kg vs 0.64+/-0.17 p=0.02). All patients preferred the addition of metformin rather than NPH insulin. None of the measured clinical and metabolic variables (before treatment FPG and PPPG, HbA1 c, post-glucagon C-peptide levels, insulin sensitivity, patient age, BMI and diabetes duration) significantly correlated to the efficacy of the two combined treatments studied. In conclusion, in NIDDM patients with secondary failure to sulphonylureas the addition of either low-dose bedtime NPH insulin or t.i.d. metformin is similarly effective in improving glycaemic control.

The dose was titrated, with FBG < 6.7 mmol/l as target, using, at most, six dose levels. The first three dose levels comprised increasing single-drug therapy (M or G) or primary combination at increasing but low dosage (MGL), and the second three levels were composed of various high-dose combinations, i.e., add-on therapy (M/G or G/M) and primary combination escalated to high dosage (MGH). Medication was maintained for 6 months after completed dose titration.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe FBG target was achieved in 9% of patients after diet alone. Single-drug therapy was insufficient in 36% and MGL in 25% (NS) of the randomized patients. There was further improvement in glucose control by the high-dose combinations. Mean FBG +/- SE was reduced (P = 0.001) from 9.1 +/- 0.4 to 7.0 +/- 0.2 mmol/l in those maintained on single-drug treatment or low-dose primary combination. Those treated with different high-dose combinations had a large mean FBG reduction, from 13.3 +/- 0.8 to 7.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/l. HbA1c levels showed corresponding reductions, and glycemic levels rose after drug discontinuation. Fasting C-peptide rose during treatment with G and MGL but not with M, while fasting insulin was not significantly changed. Meal-stimulated C-peptide and insulin levels were unchanged by M but increased by G and, to a lesser extent, by MGL. There were no significant insulin or C-peptide differences between the different high-dose combinations (M/G, G/M, and MGH). Body weight did not change following treatment with M or combination but increased by 2.8 +/- 0.7 kg following G alone. Blood pressure was unchanged. Overall effects on plasma lipids were small, with no significant differences between groups. Drug safety was satisfactory, even if the reporting of (usually modest) adverse events was high; the profile, but not the frequency, differed between groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDose-effect titrated treatment with either metformin or glyburide promotes equal degrees of glycemic control. The former, but not the latter, is able to achieve this control without increasing body weight or hyperinsulinemia. Near-normal glycemia can be obtained by a combination of metformin and sulfonylurea, even in advanced NIDDM.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35775076", "34447659", "31294086", "30222857", "28834135", "29419672"], "label": "1"}

In the Steno-2 Study, we compared the effect of a targeted, intensified, multifactorial intervention with that of conventional treatment on modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe primary end point of this open, parallel trial was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, revascularization, and amputation. Eighty patients were randomly assigned to receive conventional treatment in accordance with national guidelines and 80 to receive intensive treatment, with a stepwise implementation of behavior modification and pharmacologic therapy that targeted hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and microalbuminuria, along with secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with aspirin.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean age of the patients was 55.1 years, and the mean follow-up was 7.8 years. The decline in glycosylated hemoglobin values, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels measured after an overnight fast, and urinary albumin excretion rate were all significantly greater in the intensive-therapy group than in the conventional-therapy group. Patients receiving intensive therapy also had a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.73), nephropathy (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.17 to 0.87), retinopathy (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.86), and autonomic neuropathy (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95 percent confidence

Pharmacokinetic profiles, including area under the curve (AUC0\u2010t), maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax), and half\u2010life (t1/2), were determined for each dose of repaglinide. The relative change in blood glucose level (RC1h) and area under the blood glucose curve (AUGC0\u20131) at 1 hour after dose were also measured. After oral dosing, both Cmax and AUC0\u2010t increased linearly with dose within the 0.5\u2010 to 2.0\u2010mg dose range, regardless of ethnic group. Both Cmax and AUC0\u2010t were significantly higher in Japanese subjects than in Caucasian subjects. At each dose of repaglinide, Cmax and AUC were statistically significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasian subjects (p = 0.0038 and 0.023, respectively). Discrepancies in body weight and body mass index (BMI) between Caucasian and Japanese subjects could not explain the between\u2010group differences in Cmax or AUC0\u2010t. Statistically significant differences in pharmacodynamic parameters (RC1h and AUGC0\u20131) were found between ethnic groups (p < 0.0001), the difference being more pronounced for RC1h than AUGC0\u20131. At a dose of 2.0 mg, the mean decrease in RC1h was 41% for Japanese subjects and 24% for Caucasian subjects. Hypoglycemic reactions were more common at the highest dose (2.0 mg), where they were observed more frequently in Japanese (7 cases) than in Caucasian subjects (4 cases). It was concluded that higher serum levels of repaglinide and greater reductions in blood glucose levels are found in Japanese than in Caucasian subjects following a single oral dose of repaglinide within the 0.5\u2010 to 2.0\u2010mg dose range. Repaglinide is well tolerated in both ethnic groups.

Prevention or delay of onset of hyperglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients should reduce morbidity and mortality from these complications. NIDDM can be nearly normoglycemic when diagnosed by screening before its symptomatic stage or when clinically hyperglycemic NIDDM goes into remission. One potential strategy to delay the onset of hyperglycemia in individuals at high risk is chronic low-dose sulfonylurea therapy. Thirty black NIDDM subjects who recently had developed near-normoglycemia were followed with no treatment or were randomly assigned to a 3-year, double-blind glipizide or placebo treatment. Baseline and follow-up parameters included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, plasma insulin, and glucose responses to an oral glucose tolerance test and insulin action, as determined by the euglycemic insulin clamp. Baseline FPG and HbA1c for all three groups were 107 mg/dl and 4.7%, respectively. Relapse to hyperglycemia was defined as an FPG level \u2265 140 mg/dl on several consecutive visits or an FPG level \u2265 140 mg/dl and symptoms of hyperglycemia.

Patients were divided into three groups with creatinine clearance above 50 ml/min, 20-50 ml/min and under 20 ml/min. Fifteen fasting patients received a single dose of 3 mg glimepiride and serial blood and urine samples were taken over 24 h for pharmacokinetic and efficacy analyses. A further 16 patients received glimepiride over a 3-month period, an initial dose of 1 mg glimepiride being adjusted within the range 1 to 8 mg to achieve good glucose control. Pharmacokinetic evaluation was done on day 1 and after 3 months. Mean relative total clearance and mean volume of distribution of both single (41.6 ml/ min and 8.47 litres, respectively, when creatinine clearance was above 50 ml/min) and multiple doses of glimepiride increased in proportion to the degree of renal impairment (to 91.1 ml/min and 14.98 litres, respectively, when creatinine clearance was below 20 ml/min, single dose), whereas the terminal halflife and mean time remained unchanged. Lower relative total clearance and renal clearance of both glimepiride metabolites correlated significantly with lower creatinine clearance values. Of the 16 patients 12 required between 1 and 4 mg glimepiride to stabilize their fasting blood glucose. Glimepiride was well-tolerated and there were no drug-related adverse events. In conclusion glimepiride is safe, effective and has clearly-definable pharmacokinetics in diabetic patients with renal impairment. The increased plasma elimination of glimepiride with decreasing kidney function is explainable on the basis of altered protein binding with an increase in unbound drug.", "outbound_citations": ["12369757", "12369756", "8328999", "1930290", "2361988", "2904269", "3081293", "7016385", "383353", "4638970"], "inbound_citations": ["35144840", "34921341", "34312836", "34338406", "31704276", "30152585", "29968010", "29535952"], "label": "1"}

Patients were recruited between 1977 and 1991 and were followed up every 3 months for 3, 6, and 9 years after enrollment.\n\n\nSETTING\nOutpatient diabetes clinics in 15 UK hospitals.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nA total of 4075 patients newly diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes ranged in age between 25 and 65 years and had a median (interquartile range) FPG concentration of 11.5 (9.0-14.4) mmol/L [207 (162-259) mg/dL], HbA1c levels of 9.1% (7.5%-10.7%), and a mean (SD) body mass index of 29 (6) kg/m2.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nAfter 3 months on a low-fat, high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diet, patients were randomized to therapy with diet alone, insulin, sulfonylurea, or metformin.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nFasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels, and the proportion of patients who achieved target levels below 7% HbA1c or less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) FPG at 3, 6, or 9 years following diagnosis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe proportion of patients who maintained target glycemic levels declined markedly over 9 years of follow-up. After 9 years of monotherapy with diet, insulin, or sulfonylurea, 8%, 42%, and 24%, respectively, achieved FPG levels of less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and 9%, 28%, and 24% achieved HbA1c levels below 7%. In obese patients randomized to metformin, 18% attained FPG levels of less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and 13% attained HbA1c levels below 7%. Patients less likely to achieve target levels were younger, more obese, or more hyperglycemic than other patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEach therapeutic agent, as monotherapy, increased 2- to 3-fold the proportion of patients who attained HbA1c below 7% compared with diet alone. However, the progressive deterioration of diabetes control was such that after 3 years approximately 50% of patients could attain this goal with monotherapy, and by 9 years this declined to approximately 25%.

The estimates were further compared between the two groups irrespective of drug used to evaluate the difference, if any.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was a double blind, uncontrolled, noncrossover and randomized trial. Fifty patients of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes were divided in to two groups. Group I (25 patients) received capsule A (glibenclamide) while Group II (25 patients) received capsule B (gliclazide). The parameters studied were Superoxide dismutase (SOD), malonyl-dialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH). They were done at (a) uncontrolled stage (FBS--165 +/- 16.7 mg/dl, PP--240 +/- 30.1 mg/dl and HbA1--10.5 +/- 0.9% in group I and FBS--150 +/- 15.8 mg/dl, PP--246 +/- 29.1 mg/dl HbA1 10.6 +/- 0.8% in group II) and during controlled stage at 12 weeks (FBS--120 +/- 18.5 mg/dl, PP--180 +/- 19.1 mg/dl and HbA1--8.4 +/- 0.29% in group I and FBS--118 +/- 17.6 mg/dl, PP--176 +/- 20.1 mg/dl and HbA1--8.5 +/- 0.39% in group II patients).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe significantly raised levels of MDA and SOD, and decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) during uncontrolled stage of diabetes indicated free radical stress induced lipid peroxidation. The significant fall of MDA and SOD and increased levels of GSH in blood in both groups after control revealed beneficial effects of glycemic control on oxidative stress. The levels were not normalized and stayed higher than those in controls. On intergroup comparison; the control of diabetes with gliclazide (group II) showed improvement in oxidative stress (MDA, GSH) better (p < 0.001) than glibenclamide (group I).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOxidative stress in uncontrolled diabetes is decreased with glycemic control. The control of diabetes with gliclazide reduced oxidative stress more than glibenclamide, indicating higher antioxidant properties of gliclazide. Normalization of oxidative stress was not achieved. Further studies are required to see long-term effect of drug therapy in combating oxidative stress after achieving acceptable control of diabetes.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34759737", "33460615", "30976175", "30191997", "30146696", "30349588", "28551720"], "label": "0"}

DESIGN: Single-center, randomized, two-way, crossover design following an initial baseline evaluation phase. SETTING: Outpatient, university-based ambulatory care facility. PATIENTS: Sixteen healthy nonsmoking men aged 20\u201334 years. INTERVENTION: Three phases consisting of six treatments. Phase 1 began with treatment A, a baseline oral glucose tolerance test (GTT), followed by treatment B, glyburide 5 mg plus a GTT. The other two phases were administered in a crossover design. Phase 2 consisted of the administration of aspirin 975 mg qid for 4 days. On day 3 a GTT was administered (treatment C) and on day 4 glyburide 5 mg plus a GTT was administered (treatment E). Phase 3 consisted of the administration of ibuprofen 600 mg qid for 4 days with a GTT on day 3 (treatment D) and glyburide 5 mg plus a GTT on day 4 (treatment F). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum glyburide concentrations after each treatment, as well as glucose and insulin, ibuprofen, and salicylate serum concentrations and glyburide free fractions. RESULTS: Aspirin administration resulted in an 85% increase in mean total glyburide oral clearance and a 29% increase in glyburide free fraction. Ibuprofen administration resulted in a slight increase in mean glyburide free fraction, but no significant changes in glyburide pharmacokinetic parameters were observed. Insulin concentrations were increased during the glyburide plus aspirin treatment. Conflicting results were observed in the glucose parameters.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Twenty patients with type II diabetes between 40 and 70 years of age participated in the study. A 24-h pharmacokinetic evaluation including a 4-h Sustacal tolerance test was conducted before instituting glyburide therapy (baseline), after the first 2.5-mg test dose of glyburide and at weeks 6 and 12 of chronic glyburide therapy. Glyburide doses were titrated with a target goal of achieving a fasting plasma glucose of \u2264 7.8 mmol/l or to reach maximum daily doses of 20 mg. RESULTS A significant prolongation in the elimination half-life (t1/2: week 0, 4.0 \u00b1 1.9 h; week 6, 13.7 \u00b1 10.5 h; and week 12, 12.1 \u00b1 8.2 h) and an increased volume of distribution of glyburide was observed during chronic dosing. These results strongly suggest possible drug accumulation. No differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were noted between evaluations at week 6 or week 12. Changes in pharmacodynamic response of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide to chronic glyburide therapy were observed. Glyburide therapy significantly reduced plasma glucose levels at weeks 6 and 12 (percent changes in AUC0\u21924. glucose from baseline: week 0, \u22123 \u00b1 11%; week 6, \u2212 29 \u00b1 13%; and week 12, \u221226 \u00b1 19%). Pancreatic insulin secretion was acutely enhanced and maintained during long-term therapy. Responsiveness to therapy as assessed by the ratio of AUC0\u21924.glucose:AUC0\u21924.C-peptide was significantly improved at all weeks compared with baseline. No pharmacodynamic response differences were observed between the week 6 and the week 12 evaluations. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that significant differences in glyburide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics exist between single-dose and steady-state conditions. These differences support the need for careful dosage titration of glyburide to achieve a desired therapeutic response in patients with type II diabetes.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

It reduces blood glucose levels, predominantly by improving hepatic and peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin without affecting the secretion of this hormone. Metformin also appears to have potentially beneficial effects on serum lipid levels and fibrinolytic activity, although the long term clinical implications of these effects are unclear. Metformin possesses similar antihyperglycaemic efficacy to sulphonylureas in obese and nonobese patients with NIDDM. Additionally, interim data from the large multicentre United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) indicated similar antihyperglycaemic efficacy for metformin and insulin in newly diagnosed patients with NIDDM. Unlike the sulphonylureas and insulin, however, metformin treatment is not associated with increased bodyweight. Addition of metformin to existing antidiabetic therapy confers enhanced antihyperglycaemic efficacy. This may be of particular use in improving glycaemic control in patients with NIDDM not adequately controlled with sulphonylurea monotherapy, and may serve to reduce or eliminate the need for daily insulin injections in patients with NIDDM who require this therapy. The acute, reversible gastrointestinal adverse effects seen with metformin may be minimised by administration with or after food, and by using lower dosages, increased slowly where necessary. Lactic acidosis due to metformin is rare, and the risk of this complication may be minimised by observance of prescribing precautions and contraindications intended to avoid accumulation of the drug or lactate in the body. Unlike the sulphonylureas, metformin does not cause hypoglycaemia. Thus, metformin is an effective antihyperglycaemic agent which appears to improve aberrant plasma lipid and fibrinolytic profiles associated with NIDDM. Possible long term clinical benefits of this drug with regard to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are not yet established but are being assessed in a major ongoing study. Since metformin does not promote weight gain or hypoglycaemia it should be considered first-line pharmacotherapy in obese patients with NIDDM inadequately controlled by nonpharmacological measures. Metformin appears similarly effective for the pharmacological management of NIDDM in nonobese patients.", "outbound_citations": ["1936478", "8056129", "1773025", "8137711", "1551495", "1713132", "7843470", "3533670", "2975549", "3552509", "6391973", "1936488", "2647992", "2702918", "1936483", "7958496", "710026", "7306436", "8112499", "1778353", "1467722", "8151265", "7833731", "510803", "1505458", "1551305", "3817257", "1936475", "2193640", "8216316", "2043015", "1900072", "1748145", "2702912", "2777189", "2934311", "3328848", "4742454", "8377160", "8222336", "2956047", "1600835", "1936470", "7862618", "2404714", "8462396", "2702849", "3552795", "8462390", "1936481", "8165821", "1936467", "499320", "7821128", "7388472", "3289989", "3865878", "1936490", "2722133", "2158410", "7974348", "8435549", "8412779", "8088125", "6350337", "2648723", "3091170", "8453955", "3075902", "1936469", "1936487", "2291838", "6836759", "2060439", "1752350", "8013758", "8405019", "1280575", "8504825", "2086278", "1936473", "2198745", "8325447", "7705030", "428695", "3593625", "2192848", "7848543", "589351", "4169605", "3552515", "2523787", "6632727", "1551312", "8359098", "1718789", "2534084", "8163059", "1467715", "1955512", "1337058", "7962519", "8391425", "1711959", "3935560", "1499473", "7818725", "1759920", "6360756", "2967151", "2191888", "2020934", "1612069", "8269798", "8126125", "1936480", "2068893", "2209342", "1647995", "8070611", "1572281", "2162756", "1401073"], "inbound_citations": ["37000353", "36985444", "36642944", "36343109", "36151313", "35976138", "35628427", "36237922", "35252191", "34974794", "34230113", "33815878", "33545856", "33532657", "33347618", "33553026", "33070640", "33162888", "33178015", "33042283", "32652456", "32455555", "32391122", "31975547", "31978979", "31039656", "31511257", "31828886", "31125622", "30877903", "30668374", "29857030", "29634962", "29648567", "29438454", "29957756", "29754459", "29854390", "29518717", "29637033", "29465046", "28867217", "28778628", "28770231", "28391030", "28473852", "28073907", "28033667", "28118681", "28058263", "28044078", "27769423", "27865164", "27760420", "27688754", "27483174", "27373929", "27230777", "27076180", "27610147", "27119577", "26890736", "26421247", "25796449", "25406011", "26317052", "24905037", "22314210", "23964810", "24839014", "23773243", "23653391", "23336668", "24312816", "22380769", "22786777", "22999246", "22775317", "22988527", "22926933", "22775758", "22650223", "21959259", "22580529", "10346421", "10576528", "10576525", "12790691", "10178657", "22433668", "22105592", "24309303", "24250430", "23071938", "21677353", "20080925", "22303065", "20888602", "20583949", "20551301", "20597621", "20526383", "20004680", "20215446", "20180027", "20413862", "19723351", "18768334", "19552619", "19500993", "19405907", "19387583", "19056992", "18931616", "19551544", "18677013", "18721117", "17394563", "18372428", "18471347", "18239298", "18065318", "17331818", "17254579", "17666882", "17261574", "17336063", "17307058", "17095232", "17454168", "16797948", "16924165", "17022853", "16914074", "16810761", "16927537", "16822228", "16824829", "16449310", "16675650", "16567811", "16556094", "16512944", "16476123", "16418696", "16585812", "16219009", "16515237", "16330295", "16169430", "15932917", "15963007", "15975107", "15889234", "15925018", "15860246", "15787679", "15729560"], "label": "0"}

Troglitazone, an insulin sensitizing agent, reduces glucose concentrations in subjects with NIDDM and IGT but is not known to affect insulin secretion. We sought to determine the role of beta cell function in mediating improved glucose tolerance. Obese subjects with IGT received 12 wk of either 400 mg daily of troglitazone (n = 14) or placebo (n = 7) in a randomized, double-blind design. Study measures at baseline and after treatment were glucose and insulin responses to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, insulin sensitivity index (SI) assessed by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, insulin secretion rates during a graded glucose infusion, and beta cell glucose-sensing ability during an oscillatory glucose infusion. Troglitazone reduced integrated glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose by 10% (P = 0.03) and 39% (P = 0.003), respectively. SI increased from 1.3+/-0.3 to 2.6+/-0.4 x 10(-)5min-1pM-1 (P = 0.005). Average insulin secretion rates adjusted for SI over the glucose interval 5-11 mmol/liter were increased by 52% (P = 0.02), and the ability of the beta cell to entrain to an exogenous oscillatory glucose infusion, as evaluated by analysis of spectral power, was improved by 49% (P = 0.04).

These include the main physiological stimulator, glucose, but also other nutrients like free fatty acids and practically all pharmacological stimulators acting by depolarization and Ca2+ influx into the beta-cell. Desensitization of insulin secretion appears to be an important step in the manifestation of type 2 diabetes and in the secondary failure of oral antidiabetic treatment. In this commentary, the basic concepts and the controversial issues in the field will be outlined. With regard to glucose-induced desensitization, two fundamentally opposing concepts have emerged. The first is that desensitization is the consequence of functional changes in the beta-cell that impair glucose-recognition. The second is that long-term increased secretory activity leads to a depletion of releasable insulin, often in spite of increased insulin synthesis. The latter concept is more appropriately termed beta-cell exhaustion. The same dichotomy applies to the desensitization evoked by pharmacological stimuli: again the relative contributions of a decreased insulin content versus alterations in signal transduction are in dispute. The action of tolbutamide on beta-cells may be an example of desensitization caused by a lack of releasable insulin since the signaling mechanisms are nearly unchanged, whereas the action of phentolamine, an imidazoline, induces a strong desensitization without reducing insulin content or secretory granules, apparently by abolishing Ca2+ influx. With pharmacological agents it seems that both, alterations in signal transduction and decreased availability of releasable insulin, can contribute to the desensitized state of the beta-cell, the relative contribution being variable depending upon the exact nature of the secretory stimulus.", "outbound_citations": ["7851679", "2575711", "2572976", "3149719", "3288350", "6988275", "1102103", "4209518", "5494591", "7812517", "11755123", "11755122", "11472276", "11484070", "11289044", "11272145", "11272169", "11272180", "11147773", "11078449", "11078450", "11078440", "10871894", "10852436", "10807689", "10777708", "10868959", "10868963", "10868962", "10868940", "10512365", "10480595", "10482920", "10389845", "10455276", "10359389", "10342809", "10318919", "10194514", "10218583", "10208311", "10078552", "10025399", "9932725", "9884331", "9813050", "9786027", "9774228", "9568694", "29585584", "9535004", "9486980", "9539996", "9421296", "9374511", "9326676", "9303581", "9214381", "9133548", "9130159", "9134227", "8971073", "8922365", "8922740", "8866568", "8675683", "8631866", "8603773", "8846827", "8593930", "8628999", "7479873", "7562549", "8070607", "7952865", "8168648", "8113418", "7692969", "7679978", "8095024", "1401063", "1396327", "1643073", "1548342", "1318855", "1556189", "1532777", "1400609", "1907623", "2015970", "2015975", "1698143", "2178947", "2684709", "2544404", "2656336", "2484976", "3276325", "2442195", "3297885", "3533680", "2422950", "3512347", "3516607", "3510117", "3901180", "6139273", "6988459", "36543", "775875", "4614795", "4719673", "4919469", "14007249"], "inbound_citations": ["36120467", "34620619", "31184302", "29080222", "28866418"], "label": "0"}

We have conducted a prospective study of laboratory blood glucose profiles (8\u2009am, 9.30\u2009am after a 35\u2009g carbohydrate breakfast and in the evening between 5 and 7\u2009pm). We have included 58 consecutive NIDDM patients regularly followed in our clinic (39 men, age 60 \u00b1 11.5 years, diabetes duration 8.6 \u00b1 6.5 years, BMI 25.5 \u00b1 3\u2009kg m\u22122 ), treated with the sulphonylurea gliclazide, alone (40\u2013320\u2009mg 24\u2009h\u22121 , mean 170 \u00b1 110\u2009mg) (group 1, n = 32) or in combination with metformin (1000\u20133000\u2009mg 24\u2009h\u22121 , 2400 \u00b1 620\u2009mg) (group 2, n = 26).

Evening blood glucose values were the lowest of the day in 26 patients of group 1 (81.3\u2009%) and in 22 of group 2 (84.6\u2009%). Mean evening blood glucose levels were lower (p = 0.001) than 8\u2009am values (group 1: 5.8 \u00b1 1.4 vs 6.1 \u00b1 1.6 mmol l\u22121 , group 2: 6.5 \u00b1 1.8 vs 6.9 \u00b1 1.9) and than 9.30\u2009am values (group 1: 7.6 \u00b1 1.5, group 2: 12.3 \u00b1 2.8). No blood glucose values in the hypoglycaemic range were observed. HbA1c was strongly correlated (p = 0.002 to 0.0001) in the whole group with 8\u2009am (r = 0.39), 9.30\u2009am (r = 0.56), and evening blood glucose values (r = 0.42). These results indicate that, in patients treated with the sulphonylurea gliclazide, alone or in combination with metformin, the lowest blood glucose values occur in the evening more frequently (4/5) than in the morning. Therefore, evening blood glucose determination should be performed systematically in the course of the metabolic evaluation of NIDDM patients on oral hypoglycaemic agents. \u00a9\u20091997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

This study aimed to investigate the effects of glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea with a high affinity for myocardial K(ATP) channels, on the results of two consecutive exercise tests in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighteen type II diabetic patients with chronic stable angina pectoris participated in this study. All patients underwent two consecutive treadmill exercise tests with a recovery period of 15 min in fasting state. On the day after these exercise tests, 10 mg oral glibenclamide was given to the same patients and 30 min later 200 ml of 30% glucose solution was given orally. Half an hour later, which is the time of peak plasma levels of glibenclamide, two exercise tests were repeated consecutively with a 15 min recovery period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no difference in blood glucose levels before and after exercise tests on each day (p > 0.05). Without glibenclamide, heart rate, rate-pressure product at 1.5 mm ST depression, and peak exercise increased significantly (p < 0.05). Time to 1.5 mm ST-segment depression and onset of pain, as well as duration of exercise also increased, but ST-segment depression and ST-recovery time significantly decreased (p < 0.05). In contrast, these values did not significantly change after glibenclamide (p>0.05), with a significant drug-test interaction (p < 0.05, at two-way ANOVA).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGlibenclamide, an oral hypoglycemic agent with a K(ATP) channel-blocker activity, with a 10 mg oral dose, abolished the warm-up phenomenon which is a clinical finding of ischemic preconditioning on two consecutive exercise tests. Therefore, glibenclamide should be used carefully in patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus since this agent leads to a decrease in ischemic threshold and exercise capacity.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34191401", "31985828", "29795806"], "label": "1"}

Biguanides reduce hyperglycemia by increasing, insulin sensitivity, decreasing glucose absorption, and inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. Advantages of metformin include achieving glycemic control without exacerbating weight gain or hyperinsulinemia and beneficially affecting serum cholesterol concentrations. Although metformin has the potential to cause lactic acidosis, the incidence is significantly lower compared with phenformin. Risk factors for lactic acidosis include renal serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hepatic disease. Metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to surgery and before administration of radiologic intravenous contrast, and in patients with sepsis, severe gastrointestinal disease, trauma, and acute cardiovascular events.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35268685", "30753869"], "label": "0"}

The main aim of this study was to assess whether glyburide, a selective blocker of KATP channels and commonly used antidiabetic agent, influences resting blood flow and reactive hyperemic response of peripheral tissues of normal subjects. Baseline calf blood flow was measured non-invasively in six normal subjects with femoral venous occlusive plethysmography. Calf blood flow was also serially measured every 30-60 s after the release of calf arterial occlusion (10 min duration). Reactive hyperemia was expressed in terms of peak post-occlusive flow, duration of hyperemia and reactive hyperemic volume. In each subject, baseline flow and reactive hyperemia were measured before (control) and every hour for 5 h after the oral ingestion of either 7.5 mg glyburide or a placebo on two separate days. Baseline calf flow declined by 30 and 42% of control values after 1 and 2 h of glyburide intake (P < 0.05) with a return to control values by hours 3, 4 and 5. Peak post-occlusive flow after 1, 2 and 3 h of glyburide ingestion was lower than control values by 22, 30 and 28%, respectively (P < 0.05). The duration of reactive hyperemia after 2 and 3 h of glyburide ingestion was significantly longer than control values (P < 0.05), whereas reactive hyperemic volume remained unaffected by glyburide intake.

Several clinical trials have shown that some of the major complications of diabetes mellitus can be partially prevented or delayed by intensive glycaemic control. However, there are benefits and risks in aiming for near normal blood glucose levels. Intensive glycaemic control delays the onset and progression of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Epidemiological and observational studies have shown that cardiovascular events may be correlated with the severity and duration of diabetes mellitus, but major randomised trials have only shown weak and nonsignificant benefits of intensive glycaemic management in decreasing event rates. A modest improvement in lipid profile results from blood glucose control although, in the majority of cases, not enough to reach current targets. Detrimental effects of intensive glycaemic control include bodyweight gain and hypoglycaemia. Controversial issues in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus include the unproven increase in cardiovascular morbidity from sulphonylureas and hyperinsulinaemia, and the still unknown long term effects of newer oral antihyperglycaemic agents alone or in combination with traditional therapies (such as sulphonylureas and metformin). It is important to individualise management in setting glycaemic goals.

A cocktail consisting of the selective substrates phenacetin (CYP1A2), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), bufuralol (CYP2D6), and midazolam (CYP3A4) was incubated with human liver microsomes.

Each group was further subdivided according to the size of the thyroid nodule (< or = 15 mm versus >15 mm). Before US-FNAB, we performed the skin-marking technique with the aid of a catheter, a permanent marker, and ultrasound guidance. An established point for needle entry was indicated on the skin. The chi-square test was used to compare results between the groups of patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe proportions of adequate and insufficient biopsy material in the overall group of patients were 88.7% and 11.3%, respectively. When the patients were stratified by palpable and nonpalpable thyroid nodules, biopsy specimens were adequate in 89.8% and insufficient in 10.2% of those with palpable nodules, whereas the corresponding proportions for those with nonpalpable nodules were 87.6% and 12.4%, respectively. No statistically significant differences were noted between the two groups.

Eight nondiabetic patients with ADPKD had onset of dialysis or renal death at ages 38\u201352 years, (mean \u00b1 SEM 46 \u00b1 1.9, n = 7) as compared with four diabetics who started dialysis or are still off dialysis at the age of 61 \u00b1 2.8 years (p < 0.01).

This multicenter study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of this drug with glyburide in a 1-year randomized double-blind study of outpatients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA total of 424 subjects (154 women, 270 men) participated and had the following characteristics: age, 61 +/- 9 years; duration of diabetes. 8 years (range 0.5-35); BMI, 28.3 +/- 3.5 kg/m2; HbA1c, 7.1 +/- 1.4%; and fasting plasma glucose, 10.8 +/- 3.1 mmol/l. The majority of the subjects (91%) were previously treated with sulfonylurea, alone or in combination with metformin. The patients were randomized to a 2:1 ratio of repaglinide (0.5-4 mg t.i.d.) or glyburide (1.75-10.5 mg daily) treatment. The study protocol included a screening visit to assess patient eligibility; a titration period of 6-8 weeks, during which the dosages of repaglinide and glyburide were optimized; and a subsequent 12-month treatment period on fixed, optimal dosages.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe trial was completed by 320 subjects, 211 (74%) in the repaglinide and 109 (78%) in the glyburide group. HbA1c initially decreased in both groups and then increased during the second half-year of the maintenance period to a similar extent in the repaglinide and glyburide subjects (0.58 and 0.45% vs. at screening, respectively). In the small group of subjects who previously controlled their condition with diet only (n = 37), a sustained improvement of metabolic control could be observed with both drugs, which was slightly better with glyburide than with repaglinide (theta HbA1c -2.4 vs. -1.0%; P < 0.05). The same trends were seen with fasting plasma glucose. There were no changes in serum lipids. Over the course of the study, 15% of the repaglinide-treated and 13% of glyburide-treated subjects withdrew due to adverse events, mostly hyperglycemia.

Recently, the American College of Endocrinology also stressed earlier screening for diabetes and endorsed lowering the goal percent of hemoglobin glycosylation to 6.5%. These strategies help identify patients with diabetes at an earlier stage and in turn prevent more complications. Better control of diabetes is now feasible with the recent approval of 8 new antidiabetic products. Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are agents with a novel mechanism of action. Metformin XR, insulin aspart, and miglitol are agents that are similar to previously marketed products, but have different pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties. Metformin/glyburide is the first combination product for the treatment of diabetes.

This article provides a short review of the pharmacology and some clinical aspects of various oral antidiabetic drugs. It focuses mainly on the newest developing drugs (therapy of the near future) and on the most commonly used older groups for the common approach of every-day practice (sulphonylureas). The primary goal of this review is to compare the electrophysiological effects of glibenclamide in isolated normal and streptozotocin induced diabetic rats and alloxan induced rabbits ventricular preparations, while on the other hand to differentiate the hypoglycaemic sulphonylureas (0.1-1000 mmol/kg) according to their cardiovascular activity in healthy and diabetic animals. In vitro (1-100 micromol/l) as well as chronically treated (5 mg/kg for 10 weeks) glibenclamide prolonged the action potential duration in normal but failed to affect it in diabetic ventricular preparations. Our results suggest that the sensitivity to glibenclamide of K(ATP) channels in diabetic ventricular fibers is drastically decreased. The effects of different sulphonylureas (tolbutamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, glimepiride) on ventricular ectopic beats as well as the duration of ventricular fibrillation induced by 10 min ischemia/50 min reperfusion in healthy and diabetic rats were compared. Tolbutamide and gliclazide dose-dependently enhanced both parameters both in healthy and diabetic groups. Glibenclamide in healthy rats increased, while in diabetic rats it decreased the arrhythmogenicity. Glimepiride depressed the arrhythmogenicity in both healthy and diabetic animals. Glimepiride proved to dose-dependently enhance the myocardial tissue flow in dog in contrast to glibenclamide. These results confirm that glimepiride has less cardiovascular actions than other sulphonylureas. From the newest oral antidiabetics this review tries to emphasize the most important basic pharmacological properties, mechanism of action, therapeutic use.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32186155"], "label": "0"}

The PKPD analysis used a nonlinear mixed effect modelling approach. A mixture model was used to identify patients with a FPG response to treatment. In patients identified as responders, the decrease in FPG was related to gliclazide exposure (AUC) by an Emax relationship. An effect compartment was used to describe the link between PK and PD. A linear disease-progression model was used to assess the glycaemic deterioration observable over several months of treatment. Simulations were performed to evaluate the predictive performance of the PKPD model and to illustrate the time course of the antidiabetic effect of gliclazide MR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDisease state was found to be the main explanatory factor for intersubject variability in response to gliclazide. The percentage of responders to gliclazide, used as monotherapy, increased inversely to the number of classes of antidiabetic agents received prior to entry in the studies. In responders, the initial dose (30 mg) of the gliclazide MR dosing regimen induced half of the maximum hypoglycaemic effect. The equilibration half-life between the PK and PD steady states was 3 weeks (intersubject variability of 84%). The rate of disease progression was 0.84 mmol l(-1) year(-1) (intersubject variability 143%). The PKPD model adequately predicted the FPG profiles of 234 patients who received the current formulation of gliclazide. Simulation of a 1-year parallel dose ranging clinical trial illustrated the influence of dose, time and type of previous antidiabetic treatment on the percentage of patients with clinically significant improvement of blood glucose control.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis population PKPD analysis has characterized the relationship between the exposure to gliclazide and its long-term hypoglycaemic effect, and has established that the intersubject variability in response is mostly related to disease state. These results underline the clinical interest of quickly increasing the dose of gliclazide MR according to the response to treatment in order to achieve effective blood glucose control.", "outbound_citations": ["1287200", "11264471", "11004426", "10877312", "10877745", "10097930", "10369424", "10195646", "9742976", "8971431", "7589820", "7691511", "1532777", "1786327", "1794262", "3042340", "6368153", "6428844", "3934850", "PMC2042713", "10510947", "10454950", "9096986"], "inbound_citations": ["36999176", "35199367", "34327715", "33929614", "33650148", "32166619", "31758056", "30758834", "29679474"], "label": "0"}

The major goals of treatment are to optimise blood glucose control, and normalise the associated lipid disturbances and elevated blood pressure. Pharmacologic treatment is often necessary. This paper discusses new forms of oral treatment for subjects with type 2 diabetes. These include a new sulphonylurea compound glimepiride (Amaryl), which binds to a different protein of the putative sulphonylurea receptor than glibenclamide, and seems to have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. A new class of drugs with insulin secretory capacity, of which repaglinide (NovoNorm) is the leading compound, is now in phase III clinical trials. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors reversibly inhibit alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the small intestine, which delays cleavage of oligo- and disaccharides to monosaccharides. This leads to a delayed and reduced blood glucose rise after a meal. Two compounds are in development or have been marketed, ie, miglitol and acarbose (Glucobay). Another new class of drugs is the thiazolidine-diones, which seem to work by enhancing insulin action. The 'insulin sensitising' effects of the leading compounds, troglitazone and BRL 49653C, do not involve any effect on insulin secretion. These drugs also seem to beneficially influence serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Oral antihyperglycaemic agents can be used only during a limited period of time in most patients, after which the diabetic state 'worsens' and insulin therapy has to be started. In this light, two new forms of treatment which require subcutaneous injections are also discussed: the synthetic human amylin analogue AC137 (pramlintide) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36)-amide, a strong glucose-dependent stimulator of insulin secretion. It remains to be seen whether these compounds can be developed further for clinical use in patients with diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["8529510", "7587855", "7587846", "8529493", "7789625", "7794582", "8529508", "7744216", "8529506", "7966158", "7935656", "8001625", "8001626", "8172913", "28634739", "1505314", "1600834", "1348845", "1547676", "1499461", "1865159", "1954810", "1778353", "2192848", "2677730", "2967151", "2412077", "2862087", "8223830", "7510610", "3542669", "1884887"], "inbound_citations": ["36077003", "34444986", "34228650", "29866516", "26589882", "22469179", "22889646", "9279500", "17428467"], "label": "0"}

To date, the opposing effects of exercise and sulphonylurea administration have not been systematically studied in Type 2 diabetic patients, who are not infrequently treated with sulphonylureas. In this study nine patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus were subjected to four treatments in random order on separate days: (A) endurance exercise after the administration of 3.5 mg glibenclamide; (B) as A but given only 1.75 mg glibenclamide; (C) as A but with placebo; (D) rest and administration of 1.75 mg glibenclamide. Exercise and placebo resulted in only a small decrease in glycaemia. Rest and administration of 1.75 mg glibenclamide led to a moderate but steady fall in blood glucose concentrations. If glibenclamide administration and exercise were combined, blood glucose concentrations declined more markedly. Serum insulin concentrations showed a physiological decrease during exercise and placebo administration. If patients rested after administration of glibenclamide serum insulin levels rose and remained elevated. When exercise and glibenclamide were combined the rise in serum insulin levels was blunted and insulin levels fell once exercise was begun. Thus, exercise attenuates the glibenclamide induced increase in serum insulin in moderately hyperglycaemic Type 2 diabetic patients. Nevertheless, exercise has a substantial hypoglycaemic effect in glibenclamide treated Type 2 diabetic patients. \u00a9 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "outbound_citations": ["8911982", "8767351", "1954808", "2116159", "3115853", "6433769", "7015876"], "inbound_citations": ["35173509", "32229236", "31652237"], "label": "0"}

Because monotherapy with an oral agent does not address the multiple pathophysiologic defects of diabetes, use of combination therapy appears to be warranted. A previous 32-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that treatment with glyburide/metformin tablets was associated with greater reductions in HbA1c values compared with glyburide monotherapy, metformin monotherapy, and placebo. This study evaluated the durability of efficacy and long-term safety profile of therapy with glyburide/metformin tablets over 52 weeks. Patients enrolled in this open-label extension study were drawn from 3 groups: those who completed the 32-week double-blind study, those who were discontinued from the double-blind study, and those who were ineligible for the double-blind study and were enrolled directly in the open-label extension study. Patients with an HbA1c of < 9% received glyburide/metformin 1.25 mg/250 mg tablets BID, and those with an HbA1c of > or = 9% received glyburide/metformin 2.5 mg/500 mg tablets BID. Primary efficacy variables included changes from baseline in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and body weight at week 52. Safety was assessed based on adverse-event data and the results of physical examinations and laboratory tests. A total of 828 patients were enrolled in the study: 515 who completed the 32-week double-blind study, 138 who were discontinued from the double-blind study, and 175 who were directly enrolled. At week 52, the mean HbA1c value for the entire population had decreased from a baseline value of 8.73% to 7.04% (95% CI, -1.81 to -1.58). Patients who were enrolled directly had the poorest glycemic control at baseline and experienced the greatest reduction in HbA1c (-3.35%; 95% CI, -3.61 to -3.10). A reduction in mean FPG for the total population was observed as early as week 2, from 201 to 141 mg/dL (95% CI, -63.0 to -55.7). Symptoms of hypoglycemia occurred in 19.9% (165/828) of patients, although only one third of these patients had a documented finger-stick blood glucose value of > or = 50 mg/dL.

Therefore, we compared the effects of ethnicity on glucose/insulin/C\u2010peptide dynamics, hepatic insulin extraction, and insulin sensitivity in healthy black (n = 32) and white (n = 30) Americans. Standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and tolbutamide\u2010modified, frequently sampled, intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIVGT) tests were performed in each subject. Insulin sensitivity index (S1) was calculated using the MINIMOD method described by Bergman et al. Basal and post\u2010stimulation hepatic insulin extraction were calculated by the molar ratios of C\u2010peptide and insulin concentrations during the basal steady state and areas under the post\u2010stimulation hormone curves, respectively. Apart from a slightly greater mean serum glucose peak response after oral glucose in the whites, mean glucose levels were identical in the blacks and whites during both stimulations. In contrast, serum insulin levels at basal and during both stimulations were significantly greater (2\u20133 fold) in the blacks than whites. However, the corresponding C\u2010peptide responses were identical in both groups. The basal and postprandial hepatic insulin extraction were 33% and 45% lower in the blacks when compared to whites, respectively. The mean S1 was significantly (p < 0.02) lower in the blacks (4.93 \u00b1 0.46) than the whites (7.17 \u00b1 0.88 \u00d7 10\u22124 (mU l\u22121)\u22121).

The primary objective of this study was to determine whether therapy with sulfonylurea or basal insulin in NIDDM would alter amylin secretion in a way that might affect the formation of islet amyloid. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a randomized crossover design, eight subjects with NIDDM underwent diree 8-week periods of therapy with diet alone, sulfonylurea, or exogenous basal insulin, with evaluation of amylin, amylin-like peptide (ALP), and glucose and C-peptide concentrations, both during fasting and after a standard breakfast. Changes in (\u03b2-cell function (%\u03b2) were assessed, in the basal state by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and in the stimulated state by hyperglycemic clamps. Seven nondiabetic control subjects each underwent a meal profile and hyperglycemic clamp. RESULTS Both sulfonylurea and insulin therapy reduced basal glucose concentrations compared with diet alone, but neither reduced the increased postprandial glucose increments. Both sulfonylurea and insulin therapy increased basal %\u03b2, assessed by HOMA, but only sulfonylurea increased the second-phase C-peptide responses to the hyperglycemic clamp. Sulfonylurea increased time-averaged mean postprandial amylin and ALP concentrations compared with diet alone (geometric mean [1-SD range] for amylin, 4.9 [2.0\u201311.8] vs. 3.0 [1.4\u20136.2] pmol/1, P = 0.003; for ALP, 16.4 [8.5\u201331.7] vs. 10.1 [4.9\u201320.8] pmol/1, P = 0.001). Insulin therapy reduced basal ALP concentrations compared with diet alone (2.9 [1.5\u20135.6] vs. 6.0 [2.6\u201313.6] pmol/1, P = 0.03), but had no effect on postprandial concentrations of amylin (3.0 [1.3\u20136.5] pmol/1) or ALP (10.0 [5.5\u201318.1] pmol/1). CONCLUSIONS By increasing postprandial concentrations of the constituent peptides of islet amyloid, sulfonylurea therapy might increase the rate of deposition of islet amyloid and thereby accelerate the decline of %\u03b2 in NIDDM, compared with diet therapy alone.", "outbound_citations": ["8605675", "8645452", "7589820", "7555511", "7955969", "1425123", "1727062", "2503533", "2649327", "3289994", "3317417", "3296768", "3882489", "6376219", "7033272"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Since the antidiabetic sulfonylurea glibenclamide is known to induce splanchnic and renal vasoconstriction in portal hypertensive animals, this drug may inhibit glucose-induced hemodynamic responses in patients with cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate, in patients with cirrhosis, the short-term effects of glibenclamide on hemodynamic and humoral responses to glucose.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either glibenclamide (5-mg tablet) or a placebo. All patients received an infusion of 10% glucose (62.5 ml/h for 12 h) that was started at the same time as glibenclamide or placebo administration. Studies were performed prior to and 90 min after glibenclamide or placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGlibenclamide (i.e. glibenclamide plus glucose) significantly increased plasma insulin concentrations and glycemia while placebo (i.e. glucose alone) significantly increased glycemia but did not change plasma insulin levels. Glibenclamide did not significantly change the hepatic venous pressure gradient while this value was significantly increased following glucose alone. Glibenclamide did not significantly change renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate while glucose alone significantly increased renal blood flow without affecting the glomerular filtration rate. Glibenclamide significantly decreased cardiac index while glucose alone did not change this value.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with cirrhosis receiving glucose, glibenclamide blunted glucose-induced splanchnic and renal vasodilation. In addition, glibenclamide per se induced a decrease in cardiac index. These findings should be taken into account when glibenclamide is administered to patients with cirrhosis and type 2 diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["9927157", "9653196", "9400389", "8074198", "8075883", "1522228", "1386049", "1383242", "1484155", "2107575", "2493414", "3147903", "3371882"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

The present study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of therapy with second-generation sulfonylurea in subjects with NIDDM following secondary failure to first-generation agents.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study included 55 subjects with NIDDM who manifested secondary failure to first-generation sulfonylurea therapy. Of these, 29 subjects underwent therapy with the second-generation sulfonylurea glipizide, and 26 subjects were treated with glyburide, both drugs administered in the maximum daily dosage. Before initiation of the second-generation sulfonylurea agents and again at the end of 6 months, metabolic control was assessed by determination of fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the lipid profile.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels were 209 +/- 31 mg/dL and 12.3 +/- 2.1%, respectively, before initiation of glipizide, and did not significantly change following therapy (fasting plasma glucose, 211 +/- 34 mg/dL; HbA1c, 11.7 +/- 1.8%). Similarly, no significant alteration was noted in these metabolic values in the glyburide group (before glyburide therapy, fasting plasma glucose, 180 +/- 16 mg/dL; HbA1c, 11.2 +/- 1.6%; after glyburide therapy, fasting plasma glucose, 184 +/- 20 mg/dL; HbA1c, 11.0 +/- 1.5%). Lipids also were not significantly altered following therapy with either glipizide or glyburide. Finally, for all subjects, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c were 200 +/- 27 mg/dL and 11.9 +/- 2.0%, respectively, during treatment with first-generation drugs and did not change significantly following therapy with the second-generation agents (fasting plasma glucose, 205 +/- 20 mg/dL; HbA1c, 11.2 +/- 1.2%). P values were > .60 for all comparisons.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with second-generation sulfonylurea agents for patients with NIDDM following onset of secondary failure to first-generation sulfonylurea drugs achieves no better metabolic control than treatment with first-generation agents.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

It is characterised by a chronic non-specific inflammation of the retroperitoneum, which can entrap and obstruct retroperitoneal structures, notably the ureters. Because of the protean manifestations of RPF, awareness of the disease is important. It is still not uncommon to detect RPF only after severe renal failure is present. This comprehensive review deals with the various aspects of RPF and tries to provide a framework for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of this intriguing condition. Although it may have various causes, chronic periaortitis appears to be an increasingly encountered form of secondary RPF in patients with advanced atherosclerosis. Irrespective of its cause, most cases of non-malignant RPF \u2013 if in the active \u2018cellular\u2019 stage \u2013 will respond to treatment with corticosteroids, thereby obviating the need for surgical treatment. The clinical and radiographic improvement seen after starting steroid therapy is often impressive and reassuring as to the diagnosis. Treatment with corticosteroids may also make aneurysmectomy, if indicated, feasible in the patient who presents with perianeurysmal fibrosis and renal failure. Accumulating data suggest alternative treatment strategies for steroid-resistant cases (i.e. intensive immunosuppression) or when steroids are not feasible (i.e. other forms of immunosuppression or hormonal treatment, particularly tamoxifen). Although early diagnosis and treatment provide excellent renal and patient outcome, long-term follow-up is mandatory in all cases. I N T R O D U C T I O N Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) is an uncommon disorder of unclear aetiology. It is characterised by a chronic non-specific inflammation of the retroperitoneum, which can entrap and obstruct retroperitoneal structures, notably the ureters. Because of the protean manifestations of RPF, the condition is frequently detected during evaluation of newly diagnosed renal failure or hypertension. Its true incidence is unknown and estimates vary from 1:200,000 to 1:500,000 per year. Although more than 500 papers devoted to the various aspects of RPF can be found in the literature, there is still no accepted diagnostic or therapeutic strategy. However, the routine use of sophisticated imaging techniques has now refined the diagnostic process. In addition, an increasing number of authors propound the view that the non-surgical approach of RPF should have more support. This comprehensive review deals with recent advances in our understanding of this intriguing condition and current diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are discussed in an attempt to assess the present role of non-surgical treatment, particularly corticosteroids, in the treatment of RPF. C L I N I C A L M A N I F E S T A T I O N S Retroperitoneal fibrosis occurs predominantly in men in the fifth and sixth decade of life, the male-to-female ratio approximating 3:1. To date, however, at least 33 cases of this condition have been reported in children under 18 years of age. The early symptoms are non-specific and the correct diagnosis is often made only when obstructive uropathy or renal failure occurs. Duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis is usually four to six months and sometimes more than one year. Symptoms result from entrapment of the ureters, the great vessels and their branches, and the surrounding nerves. In the majority of patients, the presenting symptom is pain in the lower back, flank and/or abdomen. Insidious in onset, the pain is dull and non-colicky and, as the disease progresses, becomes (more) severe. Other frequent symptoms are loss of weight, malaise, anorexia, and non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. Less frequently, urinary symptoms are present: frequent micturition, oliguria or anuria. Rare symptoms include fever, testicular pain, abdominal angina, intermittent claudication, oedema or gross haematuria. Physical examination is usually unremarkable except for the presence of hypertension, probably of renal origin. Urinary tract obstruction may lead to acute hypertension in some patients, possibly by a rise in renin release; volumedependent hypertension can occur as a result of obstructive nephropathy. Reversibility of hypertension depends on the history and success of ureterolysis. In rare cases, hypertension resulted from entrapment of the renal artery. Of note, patients presenting with malignant hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy have been described. Occasionally, an abdominal or pelvic mass is present. Rare physical findings include peripheral oedema and/or thrombosis, ascites, hydrocele, jaundice, small bowel or colonic obstruction, spinal cord compression and scoliosis. Laboratory investigation primarily reflects the systemic response to inflammatory disease and/or impairment of renal function. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is almost invariably present; commonly with a normochromic, normocytic anaemia and to a lesser extent polyclonal gammopathy or mild thrombocytosis. Although azotaemia was present in 50 to 75% of patients in most early reviews, this is less common today as more patients are diagnosed before renal insufficiency develops. However, raised serum creatinine levels of varying degrees are still frequent findings, typically with normal findings on routine urinalysis.", "outbound_citations": ["11578794"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

His work analyzes the physiology of insulin and glucagon based on hepatic catheterization studies in dogs. Peripheral insulin leads to a slower fall in hepatic glucose output (HGO) than hepatic insulin infusion. The effect of the former is partly due to decreased adipose tissue lipolysis, leading to decreased glycerol availability for gluconeogenesis, and to diversion of glycogen-derived glucose to glycolysis. The half-maximal insulin concentration needed to suppress HGO is less than the normal fasting insulin level, with a tripling of insulin completely turning off the HGO. In view of the sensitivity of the (3-cell to glucose, Cherrington concluded that insulin is clearly the key minute-to-minute controller of glycemia. Increased glucagon increases the HGO, almost completely because of breakdown of glycogen, while selective glucagon deficiency decreases HGO with a marked fall in glycogenolysis. The dose-response relationship between glucagon and HGO shows a half-maximal stimulation at twice the normal fasting glucagon, so glucagon is also an important regulator of glycemia. Epinephrine and norepinephrine change little with modest changes in glucose, and suppression of catecholamines does not decrease glucose levels under basal conditions. However, an epinephrine infusion reproducing levels seen during moderate stress increases HGO, due to both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, with the latter predominating after 60 min. Norepinephrine, when infused intraportally, increases HGO only because of glycogenolysis. The liver takes up one-third of orally ingested glucose, one-third goes to muscle and fat, and the last third is used by the remainder of the body. The normal hepatic glucose uptake following oral administration of glucose is much greater than that after parenteral administration of glucose to a similar level of glycemia, suggesting the presence of additional stimulatory factors. A study from Nashville presented at the meeting showed that the gluconeogenic amino acids alanine, glutamate, and glutamine, but not other amino acids, can act as signals to the liver to enhance their own uptake, potentially increasing their gluconeogenic potential (191; references in parentheses are to abstract numbers from the Abstracts of the 57th Annual Meeting and Scientific Sessions of the ADA, Diabetes 46 [Suppl. l]:lA-434). Another study confirmed the importance of the basal portal vein insulin concentration in controlling basal hepatic glucose production (192). Gerald Shulman, New Haven, CT, discussed the cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance in the Lilly lecture. Shulman used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of naturally occurring C for assessment of glycogen synthesis and of P for measurement of glucose transport and levels of high-energy glucose and glycolytic intermediates. These studies allowed assessment of the contribution of muscle glycogen synthesis to insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and of the extent to which this is affected in type 2 diabetes.

Numerous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes occur in pregnancy that can affect the efficacy and safety of drugs, and these are difficult to predict without appropriate studies. Drugs potentially useful and safe in pregnancy have to either not cross the placenta and/or be harmless to the fetus at clinically relevant concentrations. The first characteristic can be predicted using in vitro models such as the placenta perfusion model. In the case of glibenclamide (glyburide), in vitro experiments showed minimal maternal-fetal transfer, leading to completion of a successful clinical trial of this drug in gestational diabetes. Insulin, the main drug used in diabetes during pregnancy, has also been shown not to cross the placenta in vitro, as has insulin lispro. Animal insulin may cross the placenta when complexed with anti-insulin antibodies. Other sulphonylurea drugs (tolbutamide and chlorpropamide) have been shown to cross the placenta both in vitro and in vivo and to produce toxicity in the fetus. This review summarises the pharmacokinetic data available for hypoglycaemic drugs during pregnancy, as well as the potential role for the in vitro placenta perfusion model in the preclinical evaluation of drugs with potential usefulness in pregnancy.", "outbound_citations": ["12716794", "12535577", "14712322", "11423512", "11453606", "11453617", "11453616", "11406737", "11385129", "11534307", "11353099", "11390165", "11309550", "11368292", "11238632", "11358379", "11095263", "11070177", "11036125", "10952712", "10918110", "10900213", "10954347", "10692277", "10648470", "10663449", "10332713", "10550081", "10562306", "10480503", "10398609", "10087141", "10195707", "9704240", "9678539", "9662318", "9530539", "9551701", "9469681", "9493761", "9388532", "9391746", "9203458", "9186077", "9129749", "9057784", "8885130", "8853933", "8722068", "8576296", "7631672", "7555537", "8092211", "8088125", "8362957", "1681225", "1951536", "1907234", "2033516", "1990188", "1984201", "2249069", "2195347", "2116159", "3397799", "3939118", "6242816", "6821792", "4830117", "4717441", "5477685", "4983373", "5685364", "5621454", "5926476", "20743068", "11036118", "7556974", "4134417", "4138279", "8799685", "10580075", "11568815"], "inbound_citations": ["35714934", "32127822", "29307240"], "label": "0"}

The emergency physician routinely is expected to treat a wide range of problems related to this disease, including making the initial diagnosis of type 2 and occasionally type 1 diabetes. Also common are patients with poorly controlled diabetes. The recent introduction of new classes of agents to lower blood glucose, especially in type 2 diabetes, should improve the control in this category of patient and reduce the complication rate. Some of these agents, such as troglitazone, have potentially fatal complications and require careful monitoring. Emergency physicians should be aware of the common complications of these drugs because patients can present to the ED with them. Hypoglycemia, a common cause of 911 calls and emergency visits, is not a side effect of either metformin or acarbose. Insulin lispro has improved postprandial glycemic control for type 1 and some insulin-requiring type 2 diabetics.

After screening and a 2-week washout period, 99 patients were randomized to receive either repaglinide (n = 66) or placebo (n = 33). Patients underwent 6 weeks of dose adjustment followed by 12 weeks of dose maintenance. Fasting and stimulated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were measured at predetermined intervals. Adverse events and hypoglycemic episodes were recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom baseline to last visit, mean HbA1c decreased from 8.5 to 7.8% in patients treated with repaglinide and increased from 8.1 to 9.3% in patients receiving placebo, with a statistically significant difference of - 1.7% (P < 0.0001) between treatment groups at the last visit. Mean fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose increased in patients receiving placebo and decreased in patients treated with repaglinide, with statistically significant (P < 0.01) differences between groups at the last visit. Concentrations of fasting and postprandial insulin and C-peptide were lower at the last visit compared with baseline for patients treated with placebo and higher for patients treated with repaglinide, and the differences between groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05).

This follow\u2010up study was designed to determine the effect of the same Ginkgo biloba treatment on glucose\u2010stimulated pancreatic \u2010cell function in non\u2010insulin\u2010dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) subjects. In diet\u2010controlled subjects (fasting plasma glucose [FPG], 117 \u00b1 16 mg/dl; fasting plasma insulin [FPI], 29 \u00b1 8 \u03bcU/ml; n = 6), ingestion of Ginkgo biloba produced no significant effect on the insulin AUC0 120(193 \u00b1 53 vs. 182 \u00b1 58 \u03bcU/ml/h, before and after ingesting Ginkgo biloba, respectively). In hyperinsulinemic NIDDM subjects taking oral hypoglycemic medications (n = 6) (FPG 143 \u00b1 48 mg/dl; FPI 46 \u00b1 13 \u03bcU/ml), ingestion of Ginkgo biloba caused blunted plasma insulin levels from 30 to 120 minutes during the OGTT, leading to a reduction of the insulin AUC0 120(199 \u00b1 33 vs. 147 \u00b1 58 p\u03bcU/ml/h, before and after Ginkgo biloba, respectively). The C\u2010peptide levels increased, and so the AUC0 120did not parallel the insulin AUC0 120, creating a dissimilar insulin/C\u2010peptide ratio indicative of an enhanced hepatic extraction of insulin relative to C\u2010peptide. Thus, in pancreatic cells that are already maximally stimulated, ingestion of Ginkgo biloba may cause a reduction in plasma insulin levels. Only in NIDDM subjects with pancreatic exhaustion (FPG 152 \u00b1 46 mg/dl;FPI 16 \u00b1 8 \u03bcU/ml; n = 8), who also took oral hypoglycemic agents, did Ginkgo biloba ingestion significantly increase pancreatic \u2010cell function in response to glucose loading (insulin AUC0 120 increased from 51 \u00b1 29 to 98 \u00b1 20 \u03bcU/ml/h, p > 0.0001), paralleled by a C\u2010peptide AUC0 120increase from 7.2 \u00b1 2.8 to 13.7 \u00b1 6.8 (p > 0.0001). Whether this increase is due to \u201cresuscitation\u201d of previously exhausted islets or increased activity of only the remaining functional islets is unclear. However, not even in this group did increased pancreatic \u2010cell activity cause a reduction of blood glucose during the OGTT.

Hypoglycemic agents lowered substantially concentration of cis, trans (c, t) and trans, trans (t, t) conjugated dienes in LDL-CE and LDL-TG. The duration of NIDDM has shown significant correlation (p < 0.001) with conjugated dienes in LDL-TG. Concentration of c, t and t, t-conjugated dienes in LDL-CE and LDL-TG were found significantly higher in subjects with NIDDM than NGT (p < 0.001).

Theoretically, insulin\u2010sensitizing thiazolidinediones (TZDs) should be beneficial in this patient population. A 74\u2010year\u2010old man with well\u2010compensated systolic dysfunction and longstanding type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with glyburide began therapy with rosiglitazone 4 mg/day, which was increased to 8 mg/day after 1 month.

Twelve days later symptoms worsened, with pulmonary edema on chest radiograph, continued weight gain, and +4 pitting edema resistant to oral diuretics. The patient was admitted to the hospital for exacerbation of heart failure. Five days after discharge he was readmitted for similar symptoms, including an 11.8\u2010kg weight gain. He reported adherence to drug therapy and diet. Rosiglitazone was immediately discontinued and 11 days later the man's weight stabilized to 79 kg and remained between 79 and 80 kg 2 and 3 months after discharge.

After a 4-6 week washout period, the trial assessed 22 weeks of treatment: 3 weeks (weeks 0-2) of forced titration, 11 weeks of fixed-dose treatment (weeks 3-13), and 8 weeks (weeks 14-21) of titration to maximum dose. Changes in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values were measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe combination therapy showed a significant reduction in mean HbA1c values (-1.7%) that was greater than with either type of monotherapy Repaglinide monotherapy resulted in a reduction of HbA1c values that was significantly greater than troglitazone (-0.8 vs. -0.4%) (P < 0.05). Combination therapy was more effective in reducing FPG values (-80 mg/dl) than either repaglinide (-43 mg/dl) or troglitazone (-46 mg/dl) monotherapies.

Its mechanism of action is partly similar to that of the sulphonylurea: the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells is stimulated by closure of ATP-dependent potassium channels. However, repaglinide regulates these channels via a different binding site on the beta cell than glibenclamide, and the drug does not cause insulin release in the absence of glucose, or during voltage-clamping. After oral administration the drug is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. It is therefore used in a meal-related dosing regimen; repaglinide is taken with each main meal. This meal-related use may give a more physiological mimick of daytime insulin requirement than once-daily or twice-daily use of sulphonylurea. Patients using repaglinide are less likely to develop hypoglycaemic symptoms when they miss or postpone a meal in comparison with patients on glibenclamide treatment. In long-term comparative phase 3 clinical studies it was found that repaglinide is equally effective in maintaining glycaemic control as existing sulphonylurea, but it gives significantly better control of postprandial blood glucose levels. Repaglinide can be used as monotherapy both in obese and non-obese type 2 diabetic patients, and is also very effective in combination with drugs like metformin or thiazolidines.

The aim of this article is to briefly review the various therapeutic agents available for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to suggest a potential approach to drug selection. There are three general therapeutic modalities relevant to diabetes care. The first modality is lifestyle adjustments aimed at improving endogenous insulin sensitivity or insulin effect. This can be achieved by increased physical activity and bodyweight reduction with diet and behavioural modification, and the use of pharmacological agents or surgery. This first modality is not discussed in depth in this article. The second modality involves increasing insulin availability by the administration of exogenous insulin, insulin analogues, sulphonylureas and the new insulin secretagogue, repaglinide. The most frequently encountered adverse effect of these agents is hypoglycaemia. Bodyweight gain can also be a concern, especially in patients who are obese. The association between hyperinsulinaemia and premature atherosclerosis is still a debatable question. The third modality consists of agents such as biguanides and thiazolidinediones which enhance insulin sensitivity, or agents that decrease insulin requirements like the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disease with multiple underlying pathophysiological processes. Therapy should be individualised based on the degree of hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia or insulin deficiency. In addition, several factors have to be considered when prescribing a specific therapeutic agent. These factors include efficacy, safety, affordability and ease of administration.", "outbound_citations": ["10400403", "9279500", "8736615", "9951949", "8781766", "7958544", "1778354", "1864491", "6411511", "6781964", "6997122", "3933984", "12502614", "12058698", "10480527", "10877745", "10428734", "10480767", "10372243", "10372249", "10338454", "10189566", "10189562", "10189565", "10068412", "10097910", "10193691", "10230643", "10375289", "9892229", "9802741", "9802742", "9742977", "9727891", "9742976", "9702435", "9686700", "9614617", "9614619", "9571335", "9516221", "9516229", "9518284", "9516220", "9545126", "9540024", "9454525", "9398709", "9405910", "9290539", "9223392", "9183237", "9212325", "9135927", "9075803", "9032100", "9118772", "9000704", "9009975", "9158288", "8941480", "8922349", "8908379", "8909893", "8894501", "8840095", "8596596", "8592553", "8718436", "8741812", "8554200", "8550773", "8554201", "8530433", "8722069", "7623903", "7623902", "7587855", "7587867", "7797776", "7733122", "7716539", "7794582", "7734015", "7935656", "8314011", "8013528", "8112185", "7929615", "8299482", "8112499", "8366922", "8412779", "8391425", "8516954", "10765187", "1499871", "1600834", "1349407", "1547676", "1955512", "1959473", "1872379", "1954810", "2052059", "1864219", "2209341", "2162756", "2192848", "2157941", "2404714", "2695605", "2757059", "2702912", "2909551", "2703290", "2651086", "3065001", "3129103", "3117609", "3310940", "2952432", "3552515", "3527829", "3956878", "3516607", "3522142", "3907294", "3865878", "6377892", "6691337", "6352839", "6336343", "6789956", "7047113", "445986", "370980", "520119", "214198", "351218", "992232", "5055722", "4937385", "5108228", "6019354", "10400405", "9739505", "7587918", "510102", "9211083", "78295", "9540025", "3286212", "9399962", "9506242", "4926376", "8001624", "9203460", "8569826", "10454950", "7768881", "8363212", "9219705"], "inbound_citations": ["36710469", "34285703", "33553033", "31943433", "30306360", "30188962", "29745030", "28827839", "28758131", "28342366", "26720164", "26826289", "26924713", "26906899", "26769791", "26616289", "26342135", "26162745", "24929108", "25324703", "24418013", "25183128", "23478173", "23848232", "24228060", "23630413", "23479408", "23082084", "22851177", "22701507", "21248617", "15669878", "21639404", "21281245", "20307140", "20039683"], "label": "1"}

Its optimal role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is being defined. Contribution In this randomized, controlled trial of patients who were taking the sulfonylurea glimepiride, those receiving morning glargine had greater improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels and less frequent nocturnal hypoglycemia than did patients receiving either bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) or bedtime glargine. Implications Morning glargine may be a better option for optimizing glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are also taking sulfonylureas than is either bedtime glargine or bedtime NPH. The Editors Type 2 diabetes is an increasing health problem in all western societies (1); the development of macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality rates (1, 2). It has also been demonstrated that achieving good glycemic control substantially contributes to the prevention of microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes (3). In addition, epidemiologic association analysis of the data suggests that macrovascular complications can also be prevented (4). However, current therapeutic approaches have not attained the defined targets of good metabolic control in most patients with type 2 diabetes (5). During the natural course of type 2 diabetes, -cell function is progressively lost (6), which limits the period when lifestyle modification, diet, and oral antidiabetic drug therapy are sufficient to meet targets of glycemic control. Thus, the therapeutic regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes have to be continually adapted to allow patients to consistently achieve and maintain good glycemic control. Patients with type 2 diabetes benefit from the addition of insulin to their therapeutic regimen (7-9). However, some patients express reservations regarding the administration and side effects of insulin therapy (10); therefore, effective and convenient regimens must be developed. Combination therapy with oral antidiabetic drugs and bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin has proven to be as effective as other, more complex insulin regimens and is associated with less weight gain (11, 12). Combination therapy with insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs is a regimen that can be managed at outpatient visits and that can be conveniently adapted to the patient's needs by adjusting the insulin dose on the basis of self-measured fasting blood glucose levels (13)a therapeutic target predictive of overall glycemic control (13). There are, however, limitations to achieving optimal results in daily practice with a combination of oral antidiabetic drugs and NPH insulin. Neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin exhibits a peak in its timeaction profile 4 to 6 hours after injection; thus, bedtime NPH insulin is associated with a risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia (14). This risk may limit the feasibility of titrating the NPH insulin dose to reach adequately low fasting blood glucose target values. Furthermore, the activity profile of NPH insulin is too short to provide optimal 24-hour insulin supplementation. Insulin glargine (Lantus, Aventis, Bridgewater, New Jersey) is a recently introduced human insulin analogue that exhibits a 24-hour action profile with no pronounced peak (15-17). One study of patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with basal and bolus insulin (18) and one study of patients with type 2 diabetes who were receiving oral antidiabetic drugs (14) have suggested that the addition of insulin glargine, injected at bedtime, decreases the risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin. Thus, insulin glargine is an improved basal component for combination regimens with oral antidiabetic drugs in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It remains unclear whether insulin glargine provides both better metabolic control and decreases the risk for hypoglycemia than compared with NPH insulin when used with sulfonylureas, such as glimepiride. The best timing for insulin glargine administration is also unclear. We investigated the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy of sulfonylurea (3 mg of glimepiride) with either morning insulin glargine, bedtime insulin glargine, or bedtime NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes whose diabetes was poorly controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs alone. Methods Study Design Our study was a 28-week, open-label, randomized, controlled, multinational, multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial. Patients with type 2 diabetes who did not achieve good metabolic control while receiving oral antidiabetic drugs had their oral agents replaced by 3 mg of glimepiride for 4 weeks and were then randomly assigned to receive additional treatment for 24 weeks with insulin glargine in the morning or at bedtime or NPH insulin at bedtime. Our primary objective was to investigate the effect of the different treatment regimens on glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]) and on the percentage of patients who experienced hypoglycemia. Secondary objectives were to compare the three different interventions in terms of response rates, blood glucose levels, insulin dose, and body weight, as well as adjustment of insulin dose by the investigator. A total of 111 centers in 13 European countries participated in this study. The institutional ethics committee of each participating center approved the trial, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment in the study. Patients We recruited patients from January 2000 to October 2000; treatment took place between February 2000 and June 2001. Criteria for study inclusion were as follows: 1) type 2 diabetes, 2) age younger than 75 years, 3) body mass index less than 35 kg/m2, and 4) previous oral therapy with any sulfonylurea as monotherapy or in combination with metformin or acarbose. Furthermore, the fasting blood glucose level had to be 6.7 mmol/L or greater [ 120 mg/dL], and the HbA1c level had to be between 7.5% and 10.5%. Main exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) pregnancy or breast-feeding, 2) pretreatment with insulin or any investigational drugs within the previous 3 months, or 3) presence of any clinically relevant somatic or mental diseases. Screening Phase The study consisted of a 4-week screening phase and a 24-week treatment phase. Before the start of the study, patients gave informed consent, medical histories were recorded, physical examinations were performed, and inclusion as well as exclusion criteria were satisfied. Blood samples were taken for determination of HbA1c levels, complete hematologic and clinical chemistry analyses, and lipid status. Patients were trained to use the OptiPen Pro (Aventis, Bridgewater, New Jersey) insulin injection device and the One Touch II (LifeScan, Milpitas, California) blood glucose meter. Patients discontinued use of their previous oral antidiabetic drug treatment and received 3 mg of glimepiride in the morning. Patients provided a complete 8-point, 24-hour blood glucose profile on the 2 consecutive days of the screening phase. Randomization A sequence of screening patient numbers was assigned to each study center. All patients who had entered the screening phase received a patient number. With a randomization schedule generated by the sponsor, eligible patients were linked sequentially to treatment codes allocated at random. This schedule was stratified by center on a 1:1:1 basis. Intervention During the treatment phase, patients visited the investigation sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks after randomization. At these visits, patients had to provide daily self-measured fasting blood glucose values, and episodes of hypoglycemia were recorded in a standardized diary. The investigators checked these values, and the insulin dose was adjusted according to a predefined titration regimen. Furthermore, vital signs (including blood pressure and body weight) were recorded at every visit. At baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after randomization, blood was drawn for measurement of complete hematologic and clinical chemistry analyses. At baseline and 8, 12, and 24 weeks, blood was drawn for measurement of HbA1c levels, and patients had to provide an 8-point daily blood glucose profile on 2 consecutive days. When combination therapy was initiated, insulin glargine or NPH insulin was injected subcutaneously once daily. The insulin glargine and NPH insulin formulation consisted of a cartridge containing 3 mL of either insulin preparation. Neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin had to be mixed thoroughly by rotating the injection device. The insulin dose for the first day of the treatment phase was calculated according to the formula of Holman and Turner (19) by subtracting 2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) from the actual fasting blood glucose value and dividing the result by 0.56 mmol/L (10 mg/dL). During the treatment phase, the insulin dose was titrated every visit by using a predefined regimen: If the fasting blood glucose level was greater than 5.6, 6.7, 7.8, or 8.9 mmol/L (>100, 120, 140, 160 mg/dL) for at least 1 of 2 consecutive days before the visit with no hypoglycemia, the insulin dose was increased by 2, 4, 6, or 8 units, respectively. Doses of glimepiride remained unchanged throughout the study. Analytical Methods Hemoglobin A1c levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad Diamat, Munich, Germany) in the central laboratory (INTERLAB, Munich, Germany); the reference range was 4.4% to 6.1%. Hematologic and clinical chemistry analyses were measured in local laboratories according to standard laboratory procedures. Statistical Analysis The primary efficacy assessment was the change in HbA1c level from baseline to end point and the frequency of patients who experienced hypoglycemic episodes during the study. Secondary efficacy measurements were HbA1c level ( 7.5%), fasting blood g", "outbound_citations": ["11815505", "11742409", "11551598", "11315821", "11315844", "11289462", "11130519", "10938048", "10937510", "10525654", "10068412", "9614608", "9051375", "8941458", "7589820", "1289019", "1473323", "1516500", "1828656", "2951066"], "inbound_citations": ["37142540", "37088916", "37038616", "36321411", "36483894", "35942330", "35863553", "35036430", "35141727", "34599695", "34525888", "33887352", "33646277", "33166419", "32606850", "32111010", "31423316", "31342163", "31020538", "31069944", "30226296", "30050287", "29650116", "29478255", "29524190", "28449412"], "label": "0"}

DESIGN: Retrospective prescription-based survey. SETTING: Seven primary-care health centers, comprising approximately one-third of primary-care health centers in Bahrain. PATIENTS: Patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The prescribing pattern of antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs. RESULTS: Among a study sample of 1463 patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, antidiabetic agents were prescribed as monotherapy in the following descending order: glyburide, gliclazide, insulin, and metformin. As combinations, sulfonylureas plus metformin was most popular, followed by metformin plus insulin, and sulfonylureas plus insulin. Sulfonylurea and metformin with insulin was rarely used. There was no significant difference in prescribing of glyburide and metformin between the elderly and young middle-aged diabetic patients; many patients older than 65 years were treated with a \u03b2-blocker along with a long-acting sulfonylurea. Both as monotherapy and in overall use, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium-channel blockers were most often prescribed. Among 35.5% patients treated with antihypertensive combinations, various two- and three-drug combinations of \u03b2-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, and diuretics were often used. The proportion of patients taking atenolol 100 mg/d was higher with combination regimens. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg or equivalent thiazide diuretics were extensively used.

Insulin pulsatility was assessed by 1-min interval blood sampling for 75 min 1) under baseline conditions (baseline), 2) 3 h after the first dose (80 mg) of gliclazide (acute) with the plasma glucose concentration clamped at the baseline value, 3) after 5 weeks of treatment (5 weeks), and 4) after 5 weeks of treatment with the plasma glucose concentration clamped during the sampling at the value of the baseline assessment (5 weeks-elevated). Serum insulin concentration time series were analyzed by deconvolution, approximate entropy (ApEn), and spectral and autocorrelation methods to quantitate pulsatility and regularity. The P values given are gliclazide versus placebo; results are means +/- SE. Fasting plasma glucose was reduced after gliclazide treatment (baseline vs. 5 weeks: gliclazide, 10.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/l; placebo, 10.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 11.0 +/- 0.9 mmol/l, P = 0.001). Insulin secretory burst mass was increased (baseline vs. acute: gliclazide, 43.0 +/- 12.0 vs. 61.0 +/- 17.0 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1); placebo, 36.1 +/- 8.4 vs. 30.3 +/- 7.4 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1), P = 0.047; 5 weeks-elevated: gliclazide vs. placebo, 49.7 +/- 13.3 vs. 37.1 +/- 9.5 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1), P < 0.05) with a similar rise in burst amplitude. Basal (i.e., nonoscillatory) insulin secretion also increased (baseline vs. acute: gliclazide, 8.5 +/- 2.2 vs. 16.7 +/- 4.3 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1); placebo, 5.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.2 +/- 0.9 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1), P = 0.03; 5 weeks-elevated: gliclazide vs. placebo, 12.2 +/- 2.5 vs. 9.4 +/- 2.1 pmol. l(-1). pulse(-1), P = 0.016). The frequency and regularity of insulin pulses were not modified significantly by the antidiabetic therapy. There was, however, a correlation between individual values for the acute improvement of regularity, as measured by ApEn, and the decrease in fasting plasma glucose during short-term (5-week) gliclazide treatment (r = 0.74, P = 0.014, and r = 0.77, P = 0.009, for fine and coarse ApEn, respectively). In conclusion, the sulfonylurea agent gliclazide augments insulin secretion by concurrently increasing pulse mass and basal insulin secretion without changing secretory burst frequency or regularity. The data suggest a possible relationship between the improvement in short-term glycemic control and the acute improvement of regularity of the in vivo insulin release process.", "outbound_citations": ["10855533", "10834429", "10644551", "29597486", "10491749", "10102686", "9421373", "9703326", "9439551", "29585515", "9124538", "9124326", "9005961", "8922367", "8826965", "8764190", "7485496", "7913205", "1289021", "11607165", "1794266", "2503533", "2668699", "3283554", "3283553", "2823271", "3525288", "3000741", "6134649", "7014311", "386121", "401543", "5659651"], "inbound_citations": ["33833686", "32092333", "31050588", "29307553"], "label": "1"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Fourteen patients with NIDDM received metformin or glibenclamide for 1 month in a double-blind, randomized crossover study. At the end of each treatment period, patients were tested for forearm vascular responsiveness to intrabrachial arterial infusion of diazoxide (an ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener), acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, and norepinephrine, BP responses to intravenous infusions of NE and angiotensin II, BP responses to cold pressor testing and isometric exercise, and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring. RESULTS Metformin and glibenclamide produced similar glycemic control. Mean 24-h BPs did not differ between the two groups, but mean 24-h heart rates were significantly lower (75 \u00b1 6 bpm vs. 80 \u00b1 6 bpm) on glibenclamide therapy than on metformin. Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly higher on glibenclamide (6.41 \u00b1 1.77 vs. 4.26 \u00b1 1.54 mmol/l, P < 0.01), and systolic BP responses to intravenous norepinephrine and angiotensin II were significantly higher on glibenclamide than on metformin (P < 0.02 and P < 0.05, respectively). Systolic BP responses to cold pressor testing appeared higher on glibenclamide than on metformin, but the difference did not quite achieve statistical significance (P = 0.052). Baseline forearm vascular resistance did not differ between the two drugs, nor did forearm vascular resistance responses to diazoxide, acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, and norepinephrine differ. CONCLUSIONS Glibenclamide therapy is accompanied by greater systolic BP responses to norepinephrine and angiotensin II and higher plasma norepinephrine levels than those that occur on metformin therapy. Lower heart rates on glibenclamide therapy despite evidence of greater sympathetic activity suggests that glibenclamide may have negative chronotropic effects.", "outbound_citations": ["8269798", "8359098", "8319994", "8507452", "1291084", "1592458", "1920112", "1936111", "2040704", "1900072", "2669710"], "inbound_citations": ["34514697", "32793438", "30290005"], "label": "0"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a prospective study, we followed 769 men and 1,089 women, aged 50\u201389 years, who had no history of diabetes or myocardial infarction and demonstrated no fasting hyperglycemia (i.e., FPG < 7.0 mmol/l) when they underwent oral glucose tolerance testing at baseline in 1984\u20131987. RESULTS At baseline, 70% of 125 women and 48% of 133 men with previously undiagnosed diabetes had IPH. Over the next 7 years, women with IPH had a significantly increased risk of fatal CVD and heart disease compared with nondiabetic women. This increased risk was not observed in men with IPH. This association was independent of age, hypertension, central obesity, cigarette smoking, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (multiply adjusted hazard ratio and 95% CI: 2.6 and 1.4\u20134.7 for CVD; 2.9 and 1.3\u20136.4 for heart disease). CONCLUSIONS Diabetes defined by IPH alone is common in older adults and more than doubles the risk of fatal CVD and heart disease in older women. Because the prevalence of IPH increases with age, the use of fasting glucose alone for diabetes screening or diagnosis may fail to identify most older adults at high risk for CVD and should be reevaluated.", "outbound_citations": ["12017675", "1895787", "1987413", "6633571", "6977705", "6968510", "935073", "4337382"], "inbound_citations": ["36303603", "36086734", "35842601", "35301277", "36072872", "34353879", "33711395", "33296453", "33033935", "32707776", "32497744", "32327419", "32110077", "31371856", "30894382", "31435395", "29991519", "30355075", "29774661", "29502350", "29676544", "29402990", "28544644", "30170640", "30299889"], "label": "0"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS VEPs (P100 wave latencies) were recorded in 12 poorly controlled diabetic patients (7 with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 5 with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) before and after at least 3 days of near normoglycemia obtained by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Exclusion criteria were overt diabetic neuropathy or retinopathy. The control subjects were 12 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. Fifty-two other subjects formed a reference control population. The intra-individual coefficient of variation for P100 latency was < 3%. RESULTS The P100 latencies were longer in diabetic patients than in control subjects (means of both eyes \u00b1 SD: 116.8 \u00b1 10.1 vs. 106.2 \u00b1 4.5 ms, P < 0.01), and 4 of the 12 diabetic patients had abnormal VEPs. After 3 days of close blood glucose control (mean blood glucose profile fell from 13.7 \u00b1 2.2 mmol/l to 6.8 \u00b1 1.2 mmol/l, P < 0.01), the mean P100 latencies were significantly shorter (112.5 \u00b1 7.6 ms, P < 0.01) but were still significantly longer than control values. The longer the initial P100 latency, the greater the decrease after CSII. There was no correlation between the fall in blood glucose and improvement in VEPs. CONCLUSIONS Short-term blood glucose normalization is associated with improved P100 wave latency in uncomplicated diabetic patients.

In this job we review the targets in the metabolic control of type 2 DM and their backgrounds, and we describe briefly the therapeutic strategy recommended for reaching these targets, with special attention to the new oral antidiabetic agents (repaglinide and thiazolidinediones).", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Leptin is a hormone that regulates weight in mice. In obese humans, leptin concentrations are increased, suggesting resistance to the effects of this hormone. Although short-term infusion of insulin during the hyperinsulinemiceuglycemic clamp does not increase leptin concentration, the effect of oral antidiabetic agents on leptin concentration is unknown. Differing effects can be expected, since glibenclamide acts via stimulation of insulin secretion, whereas acarbose inhibits alpha-glucosidases of the small intestine and has no direct effect on insulin levels. We examined the effect of acarbose (n = 4), glibenclamide (n = 6), and placebo (n = 6) on insulin and leptin levels during 24-h periods before and after 16 weeks of therapy. RESULTS We observed a significant diurnal variation in leptin concentrations. This was inversely related to insulin levels during the 24-h follow-up with usual diet. Neither the placebo nor acarbose altered leptin concentrations. However, glibenclamide increased leptin concentrations parallel to insulin levels. There were only minor changes in body weight during the l6-week follow-up: decrease in the placebo group (change \u22120.5 kg/m2, P = 0.07) and acarbose (change \u22120.7 kg/m2, P = 0.046) and increase in the glibenclamide group (change 0.8 kg/m2, P = 0.27). However, individual subjects who gained weight had increases in their leptin concentrations. The diurnal variation in leptin concentrations was preserved after glibenclamide. CONCLUSIONS Glibenclamide increases circadian leptin and insulin concentrations, whereas acarbose does not. This observation may help to explain weight gain in subjects treated with glibenclamide and stable weight in those treated with acarbose in the long run.", "outbound_citations": ["8772734", "8635660", "8621026", "8636448", "8576190", "8532024", "7584987", "7585223", "7769141", "7833731", "1425482", "1954810", "2499589", "2957420", "6822642", "7304739", "111449"], "inbound_citations": ["31081759", "29773163"], "label": "0"}

Insulin analogues with novel pharmacokinetics have been developed. The first of these analogues to appear in the market was insulin lispro. We believe that the most part of the stu-dies carried out with this molecule in comparison with regular insulin were unfair as long as its short duration of action was ignored, since in many of these studies it was administered with meals and with only one dose of intermediate insulin given at night. Several studies done mainly by Italian investigators have proven this concept being true in studies with adequate baseline insulin coverage. Insulin aspart has appeared recently in the market in the United States with very similar effects to lispro. The FDA has recently approved a new ultralong acting analogue. The main advantages are its long, peakless action with better effects during down hours and a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia. We also review other approaches with novel insulin molecules attached to thyroxin or fatty acids in order to create a bridge for binding to plasmatic proteins. These molecules have longer effects and some of them more selective sites of action.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Ninety-six NIDDM patients (35\u201370 years of age, body mass index [BMI] \u2264 35), insufficiently treated with diet alone (HbA1c 7\u20139%) were randomized into three groups and treated for 24 weeks with acarbose, glibenclamide, or placebo. Efficacy, based on fasting blood glucose (BG), BG 1 h after ingestion of standard breakfast (postprandial), serum insulin, postprandial insulin increase, and HbA1c; and tolerability, based on subjective symptoms and laboratory values, were investigated every 6 weeks. Efficacy evaluation was valid for 85 patients. RESULTS The test drugs were dosed as follows: 100 mg acarbose (A) three times a day, 1 placebo tablet three times a day, 3.5 mg glibenclamide tablets dosed 1\u20130-0 or 1\u20130-1, mean dose 4.3 mg/day.

The mean relative insulin increase (1-h postprandial) was 1.5 in the placebo group, 1.1 in the acarbose group, and 2.5 in the glibenclamide group. No changes in body weight could be observed. No adverse events were seen under placebo. Acarbose led to mild or moderate intestinal symptoms in 38% of patients. Glibenclamide led to hypoglycemia, which could be solved by dose reduction, in 6% of patients. No dropouts occurred in any of the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Acarbose and glibenclamide are effective drugs for the monotherapy of NIDDM patients when diet alone fails.

In contrast to sulfonylureas, metformin does not stimulate insulin secretion, promote weight gain, exacerbate hyperinsulinemia, or cause hypoglycemia. It also favorably affects serum lipids. Methods: A comprehensive review of the medical literature from 1968 to the present was conducted using the key words \u201cmetformin\u201d and \u201cnon-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\u201d Results: Metformin monotherapy was superior to placebo and comparable to sulfonylureas in reducing fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with NIDDM uncontrolled by diet. Metformin and sulfonylureas, however, had diverse effects on body weight and fasting plasma insulin levels; both weight and insulin levels remained unchanged or decreased with metformin and increased with sulfonylureas. In patients with secondary sulfonylurea failure, the combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea synergistically improved glycemic control better than either drug alone and was comparable to insulin plus sulfonylurea. When hyperglycemia is uncontrolled by insulin after secondary sulfonylurea failure, limited data suggest the efficacy of metformin plus insulin. The mild, transient, self-limited gastrointestinal side effects that sometimes occur can be minimized by gradually increasing the doses and by taking metformin with food. Risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is low if prescribing guidelines are adhered to. Potential adverse drug interactions include hypoglycemia during concurrent sulfonylurea therapy and elevated metformin plasma concentrations when metformin is taken concomitantly with cimetidine. Conclusions: Metformin can be used safely and effectively as first-line monotherapy in NIDDM or in combination with a sulfonylurea when monotherapy with either agent fails.

PATIENTS were tested monthly for circadian blood glucose profiles and glycosylated hemoglobin. Mild hypoglycaemia was defined on the basis of blood glucose values < 2.8 mmol/l associated with mild autonomic symptoms, without requiring external assistance. Each diabetic patient filled personal diary indicating the therapy regimen and the characteristics of eventual hypoglycaemic episodes occurring during the observation period.\n\n\nRESULTS\n21.8% of NIDDM patients experienced one or two episodes of mild hypoglycaemia during the observation period. The analysis of the patients' diaries showed that 60% of the hypoglycaemic episodes was associated with excessive, prolonged and unexpected physical exertions. Within this group, about 70% of the episodes occurred during a holiday (\"holiday hypoglycaemia\"). After analyzing the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the diabetic patients reporting hypoglycaemic events, we found a higher risk for \"holiday hypoglycaemia\" in patients with a lower educational level, with a sedentary occupation or among the ex-farmers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs resulted in the present study, unexpected physical exertions may represent a relevant cause of mild hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients receiving oral antidiabetic therapy. However, this hypoglycaemic cause may have been underestimated in the literature. Educational programs conducted by general practitioners or diabetologists could be useful for the patients in reducing the number of mild hypoglycaemic episodes.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36620247"], "label": "0"}

We cross-tabulated FPG concentrations (<6.1 mmol/L [110 mg/dL], 6.1-6.9 mmol/L [110-125 mg/dL], 7.0-7.7 mmol/L [126-139 mg/dL], and > or =7.8 mmol/L [140 mg/dL]) and HbA1c levels separated into 3 intervals: normal, less than the upper limit of normal (ULN); slightly elevated, ULN to ULN plus 1%; and high, higher than ULN plus 1%.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong subjects with normal FPG concentrations, HbA1c levels in the NHANES III (and the MRG) data sets were normal in 97.3% (96.2%), slightly elevated in 2.7% (3.6%), and high in 0.1% (0.2%). Among individuals with impaired fasting glucose, HbA1c concentrations were normal in 86.7% (81.4%), slightly elevated in 13.1% (16.4%), and high in 0.2% (2.2%). Among diabetic patients diagnosed by the new FPG criterion only, HbA1c levels were normal in 60.9% (59.6%), slightly elevated in 35.8% (32.8%), and high in 3.4% (7.6%). In diabetic patients diagnosed by the former FPG criterion, HbA1c levels were normal in 18.6% (16.7%), slightly elevated in 32.5% (21.0%), and high in 48.9% (62.3%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAbout 60% of the new cohort of diabetic patients in both data sets have normal HbA1c levels. We believe that diabetes should not be diagnosed in those with FPG concentrations less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) unless excessive glycosylation is evident. Individuals without excessive glycosylation but with moderate elevations of FPG concentrations (6.1-7.7 mmol/L [110-139 mg/dL]) should be diagnosed as having impaired fasting glucose and treated with an appropriate diet and exercise.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied 95 elderly patients with NIDDM (age 68 \u00b1 9 years, BMI 26.0 \u00b1 4.6 kg/m2, and median time since diagnosis of diabetes 9 years [range 1\u201337]; 37 men, 58 women), who were poorly controlled, despite diet and maximal doses of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Three insulin administration regimens were compared during a 6-month period: patients were randomized for treatment with a two-injection scheme (regimen A) or a combination of glibenclamide with one injection of NPH insulin, administered either at bedtime (regimen B) or before breakfast (regimen C), and insulin treatment was mainly instituted in an outpatient setting. RESULTS After 6 months of insulin treatment, fasting blood glucose of the total patient population had decreased from an average of 14.1 \u00b1 2.2 to 8.3 \u00b1 2.0 mmol/l (P < 0.001), and HbA1c fell from 11.0 \u00b1 1.3 to 8.3 \u00b1 1.2% (P < 0.001); 34 patients reached HbA1c levels below 8.0%, 25 of them even below 7.5%. With two insulin injections daily, HbA1c decreased from 11.2 \u00b1 1.3 to 8.2 \u00b1 1.2%, while during combined treatment, HbA1c fell from 10.5 \u00b1 1.2 to 8.1 \u00b1 1.1% (regimen B) and from 11.1 \u00b1 1.3 to 8.5 \u00b1 1.1% (regimen C). Comparable improvement of the other measures of glycemic control, lipids and lipoproteins, was observed in the different treatment regimens. Body weight increase was moderate (mean \u00b1 4.0 kg) and similar in all patient groups. One-third of patients starting with one insulin injection daily needed a second injection to control glycemia. One episode of severe hypoglycemia was observed. Combined insulin-sulfonylurea treatment was almost 20% more expensive than twice-daily administration of insulin alone. CONCLUSIONS Insulin treatment can safely be instituted in elderly patients with NIDDM. However, it is difficult to obtain optimal glycemic control. Insulin has moderate beneficial effects on serum lipoproteins. Although on the basis of glycemic control and weight gain, no preference for any treatment regimen can be discerned, twice-daily insulin administration is the most simple and cost-effective regimen.", "outbound_citations": ["8366922", "8334821", "1406860", "1612070", "2192851", "2182032", "2180397", "2649348", "2677730", "2507265", "2527134", "2653929", "3239454", "3318259", "3328848", "3516607", "3919531", "6439036", "6376024", "6629834", "6813094", "6795073", "7207655", "430719", "1106937", "14414811"], "inbound_citations": ["30008760"], "label": "0"}

Furthermore, in many people with diabetes the disease deteriorates, despite the use of blood-glucose lowering medication, due to the decline of the pancreatic beta cells. The development of new drugs, such as repaglinide, is therefore important. Repaglinide is an insulin secretion enhancer with a different mechanism of action to the sulphonylureas, which means it does not continuously stimulate insulin secretion. The tablets should be taken with each meal. After oral ingestion repaglinide is resorbed quickly, with a half-life of between 30 minutes to an hour. In clinical trials repaglinide has been found to be equally effective as glibenclamide. Repaglinide has been found to be particularly effective in sulphonylurea-na\u00efve patients. Skipping the meal plus tablet combination results in less frequent hypoglycaemic symptoms compared to glibenclamide. Repaglinide results in greater reductions in postprandial glucose levels than glibenclamide. It does not affect insulin resistance. Long-term data are lacking, both with regard to efficacy and side effects. Repaglinide deserves a place in the diabetes treatment of newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients who are well-informed about their disease, as well as in patients with renal failure.

This study investigated whether intensive glucose control with metformin has any specific advantage or disadvantage. Of 4075 patients recruited to UKPDS in 15 centres, 1704 overweight (>120% ideal bodyweight) patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, mean age 53 years, had raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG; 6.1-15.0 mmol/L) without hyperglycaemic symptoms after 3 months' initial diet. 753 were included in a randomised controlled trial, median duration 10.7 years, of conventional policy, primarily with diet alone (n=411) versus intensive blood-glucose control policy with metformin, aiming for FPG below 6 mmol/L (n=342). A secondary analysis compared the 342 patients allocated metformin with 951 overweight patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control with chlorpropamide (n=265), glibenclamide (n=277), or insulin (n=409). The primary outcome measures were aggregates of any diabetes-related clinical endpoint, diabetes-related death, and all-cause mortality. In a supplementary randomised controlled trial, 537 non-overweight and overweight patients, mean age 59 years, who were already on maximum sulphonylurea therapy but had raised FPG (6.1-15.0 mmol/L) were allocated continuing sulphonylurea therapy alone (n=269) or addition of metformin (n=268). Median glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.4% in the metformin group compared with 8.0% in the conventional group. Patients allocated metformin, compared with the conventional group, had risk reductions of 32% (95% CI 13-47, p=0.002) for any diabetes-related endpoint, 42% for diabetes-related death (9-63, p=0.017), and 36% for all-cause mortality (9-55, p=0.011). Among patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control, metformin showed a greater effect than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related endpoint (p=0.0034), all-cause mortality (p=0.021), and stroke (p=0.032). Early addition of metformin in sulphonylurea-treated patients was associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related death (96% increased risk [95% CI 2-275], p=0.039) compared with continued sulphonylurea alone. A combined analysis of the main and supplementary studies showed fewer metformin-allocated patients having diabetes-related endpoints (risk reduction 19% [2-33], p=0.033). Epidemiological assessment of the possible association of death from diabetes-related causes with the concurrent therapy of diabetes in 4416 patients did not show an increased risk in diabetes-related death in patients treated with a combination of sulphonylurea and metformin (risk reduction 5% [-33 to 32], p=0.78).

Design and methods Fourteen patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, seven of whom were receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, received glibenclamide or placebo for 1 month in a double-blind, randomized crossover study. At the end of each treatment period patients attended for studies of forearm vascular responsiveness to intra-brachial arterial infusions of angiotensin II, acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside and noradrenaline, responses of blood pressure to intravenous infusions of noradrenaline and angiotensin II and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Results Administration of glibenclamide produced significantly better glycaemic control than placebo (fasting blood glucose level 8.5 \u00b1 2.4 versus 13.5 \u00b1 4.5 mmol/l, P < 0.001) and plasma insulin levels were significantly higher during glibenclamide treatment than they were with placebo (12.9 \u00b1 4.4 versus 9.2 \u00b1 4.1 mU/l, P < 0.05). Body weights at the ends of the glibenclamide treatment and placebo phases were similar (92.1 \u00b1 14.3 versus 91.1 \u00b1 14.3 kg, P = 0.085). Night-time systolic blood pressures were significantly higher during glibenclamide treatment than they were with placebo (128 \u00b1 17 versus 118 \u00b1 10 mmHg, P < 0.05) due to there being a smaller day\u2013night difference in systolic blood pressure during glibenclamide treatment that appeared to occur mainly in patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Responses of diastolic blood pressure to intravenous infusion of angiotensin II and forearm vascular responses to intra-brachial arterial infusion of angiotensin II were significantly greater during glibenclamide treatment than they were with placebo (P < 0.05). However, the enhancement of forearm vascular responses during glibenclamide treatment appeared to be restricted to patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Responses of blood pressure to intravenous infusion of noradrenaline and forearm vascular responses to infusions of noradrenaline, acetylcholine and nitroprusside did not differ between glibenclamide treatment and placebo; neither did basal forearm vascular resistance. Conclusions Glibenclamide therapy is associated with greater responses of blood pressure and forearm vascular responses to infusion of angiotensin and higher nocturnal blood pressures. This effect appears to be influenced by concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.

The patients were switched to insulin treatment with bedtime NPH insulin combined with daytime sulphonylurea (combination group) or twice daily injections of a premixed combination of regular human and NPH insulin (insulin twice daily group) with measurements as given below before and after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHbA(1c) was lowered from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 7.0 +/- 0.2% in the insulin twice daily group (p<0.05) and from 8.3 +/- 0.3% to 6.8 +/- 0.5% in the combination group (p<0.03; ns between treatment groups). Body weight increased from 71.7 +/- 4.0 kg to 77.6 +/- 4.4 kg in the insulin twice daily group (p<0.001) and from 70.8 +/- 4.6 kg to 72.7 +/- 5.1 kg in the combination group (ns; p<0.02 between groups). The dose of insulin at 24 weeks in the insulin twice daily group was 45.8 +/- 4.2 U and 29.4 +/- 5.4 U in the combination group (p=0.03). Combination treatment reduced fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBoth treatments improved glycaemic control to the same extent but the combination of bedtime NPH insulin and daytime sulphonylurea gave a very small increase of body weight over a 6 months period. We conclude that combination therapy is an attractive alternative when starting insulin treatment in patients with Type 2 diabetes as this is a critical period for weight gain in such patients.", "outbound_citations": ["3133266", "11315844", "10547209", "10566566", "10068412", "10230643", "9742976", "8941458", "8960854", "18406751", "8737030", "7587856", "7924784", "8422777", "1464414", "1642079", "1532777", "1737539", "1828656", "3279941", "2959438", "3100365"], "inbound_citations": ["29535952", "27640062", "26425465", "22470171", "22167054", "15200348", "20002080", "19175375", "17976204", "17403126", "15677775"], "label": "0"}

DATA SOURCES: The English literature was searched from 1966 through May 2002 using MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and EMBASE. The key words included chromium, glucose, lipids, and diabetes. Pertinent references from review articles and studies were used as additional sources. DATA SYNTHESIS: Trivalent chromium is an essential nutrient and has a key role in lipid and glucose metabolism. Supplementation with chromium does not appear to reduce glucose levels in euglycemia. It may, however, have some efficacy in reducing glucose levels in hyperglycemia. The effects of chromium on lipid levels are variable. Chromium in doses <1000 \u03bcg/d appears to be safe for short-term administration. Kidney function and dermatologic changes need to be monitored.

The relative risks and benefits of intensive insulin therapy in NIDDM are not well defined. Accordingly, we designed a feasibility study that compared standard therapy and intensive therapy in a group of NIDDM men who required insulin due to sustained hyperglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A prospective trial was conducted in five medical centers in 153 men of 60 \u00b1 6 years of age who had a known diagnosis of diabetes for 7.8 \u00b1 4 years. They were randomly assigned to a standard insulin treatment group (one morning injection per day) or to an intensive therapy group designed to attain near-normal glycemia and a clinically significant separation of glycohemoglobin from the standard arm. A four-step plan was used in the intensive therapy group along with daily self-monitoring of glucose: 1) an evening insulin injection, 2) the same injection adding daytime glipizide, 3) two injections of insulin alone, and 4) multiple daily injections. Patient accrual and adherence, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), side effects, and measurements of endpoints for a prospective long-term trial were assessed. RESULTS Accrual goals were met, mean follow-up time was 27 months (range 18\u201335 months), and patients kept 98.6% of scheduled visits. After 6 months, the mean HbA1c in the intensive therapy group was at or below 7.3% and remained 2% lower than the standard group for the duration of the trial. Most of the decrease in the mean HbA1c in the intensive group was obtained by a single injection of evening intermediate insulin, alone or with daytime glipizide. By the end of the trial, 64% of the patients had advanced to two or more injections of insulin a day, aiming for normal HbA1c. However, only a small additional fall in HbA1c was attained. Severe hypoglycemia was rare (two events per 100 patients per year) and not significantly different between the groups, nor were changes in weight, blood pressure, or plasma lipids. There were 61 new cardiovascular events in 40 patients and 10 deaths (6 due to cardiovascular causes). CONCLUSIONS Intense stepped insulin therapy in NIDDM patients who have failed glycemic control on pharmacological therapy is effective in maintaining near-normal glycemic control for > 2 years without excessive severe hypoglycemia, weight gain, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. Cardiovascular event rates are high at this stage of NIDDM. A long-term prospective trial is needed to assess the risk-benefit ratio of intensified treatment of hyperglycemia in NIDDM patients requiring insulin.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36718676", "36272764", "32998798", "32343474", "32306731", "30144425", "29678605", "29650116", "29405097", "30246878", "29098553"], "label": "1"}

Like the sulphonylureas, repaglinide reduces blood glucose by stimulating insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells, but differs from these and other antidiabetic agents in its structure, binding profile, duration of action and mode of excretion. In clinical trials of up to 1-year's duration, repaglinide maintained or improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In comparative, 1-year, double-blind, randomised trials (n = 256 to 544), patients receiving repaglinide (0.5 to 4mg before 3 daily meals) achieved similar glycaemic control to that in patients receiving glibenclamide (glyburide) < or = 15 mg/day and greater control than patients receiving glipizide < or = 15 mg/day. Changes from baseline in glycosylated haemoglobin and fasting blood glucose levels were similar between patients receiving repaglinide and glibenclamide in all studies; however, repaglinide was slightly better than glibenclamide in reducing postprandial blood glucose in I short term study (n = 192). Patients can vary their meal timetable with repaglinide: the glucose-lowering efficacy of repaglinide was similar for patients consuming 2, 3 or 4 meals a day. Repaglinide showed additive effects when used in combination with other oral antidiabetic agents including metformin, troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, and intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) given at bedtime. In 1-year trials, the most common adverse events reported in repaglinide recipients (n = 1,228) were hypoglycaemia (16%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%), rhinitis (7%), bronchitis (6%) and headache (9%). The overall incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar to that recorded in patients receiving glibenclamide, glipizide or gliclazide (n = 597) [18%]; however, the incidence of serious hypoglycaemia appears to be slightly higher in sulphonylurea recipients. Unlike glibenclamide, the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients receiving repaglinide was not increased when a meal was missed in 1 trial. In conclusion, repaglinide is a useful addition to the other currently available treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Preprandial repaglinide has displayed antihyperglycaemic efficacy at least equal to that of various sulphonylureas and is associated with a reduced risk of serious hypoglycaemia. It is well tolerated in a wide range of patients, including the elderly, even if a meal is missed. Furthermore, glycaemic control is improved when repaglinide is used in combination with metformin. Thus, repaglinide should be considered for use in any patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood glucose cannot be controlled by diet or exercise alone, or as an adjunct in patients whose glucose levels are inadequately controlled on metformin alone.", "outbound_citations": ["11472451", "11347758", "11417447", "11232737", "11194214", "11210240", "11063283", "10977012", "11063281", "10895850", "10834429", "10857945", "10666428", "10664925", "10664920", "10668848", "10615961", "10522837", "10522841", "10611470", "10561134", "10501822", "10877745", "10499883", "10372249", "10332683", "10379630", "10220200", "10199798", "10363735", "10097930", "10369424", "10030326", "10820647", "10333912", "9892231", "11475269", "9825953", "9802740", "9793758", "9742977", "9571335", "9549452", "9519738", "9405900", "9369378", "9283692", "8981561", "8628999", "7587918", "7848543", "8458198", "1503670", "1737544", "1770103", "2503533", "3283554", "10400405", "7958542", "9739505", "7589820", "4359625", "7622004", "10860187", "9715377", "10158995", "12817528", "10983737", "9742976", "9506242", "9715376", "3865878", "2224742", "10631622", "9877000", "8366922", "8223830", "10454950", "9739502", "8123057", "8591815", "992232", "10776834", "7671557", "9545118", "9951949", "10466661"], "inbound_citations": ["37047011", "36707679", "35833285", "35568922", "35080257", "34027322", "33933705", "32816575", "31884929", "35492562", "31729898", "31114280", "29732710"], "label": "1"}

The objectives of treatment are to improve glycaemic control in a stepwise approach that involves nonpharmacological methods including diet and exercise, and pharmacological therapy including mixtures of oral antihyperglycaemic agents alone or in combination with insulin. Although the goals of treatment may be the same for elderly and younger patients, certain aspects of type 2 diabetes in the elderly require special consideration. Treatment decisions are influenced by age and life expectancy, comorbid conditions and severity of the vascular complications. Adherence to dietary therapy, physical activity, and medication regimens may be compromised by comorbid conditions and psychosocial limitations. Drug-induced hypoglycaemia has been the main consideration and the most serious potential complication. In addition, the long term macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes are a source of significant morbidity and mortality. Indeed, vascular and neuropathic complications are already present at the time of diagnosis in a significant number of patients, and the impact of improved diabetes control depends on the age and life expectancy of the patient. Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and the potential for adverse effects and drug interactions should also be considered when choosing appropriate pharmacological therapy. In general, a conservative and stepwise approach to the treatment of the elderly patient with type 2 diabetes is suggested; treatment may be initiated with monotherapy, followed by early intervention with a combination of oral agents including a sulphonylurea as a foundation insulin secretagogue in addition to a supplemental insulin sensitiser. Insulin therapy is eventually required if significant hyperglycaemia [glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) >8%] persists despite oral combination therapy. Combination therapy with evening insulin and a long-acting sulphonylurea such as glimepiride is an effective strategy to improve hyperglycaemia in the elderly patient with type 2 diabetes in whom polypharmacy with oral agents is unsuccessful. In addition, such a regimen is simple to follow for the patient who may not be able to adhere to a more complicated insulin regimen. Hyperglycaemia in the elderly can be managed well with practical intervention and a straightforward treatment plan to enhance compliance. Optimal glycaemic control should be possible for every patient if treatment is individualised; however, strict glycaemic control may not be achievable in all patients or even desirable in many elderly patients.", "outbound_citations": ["11757083", "10675071", "10227562", "9855316", "9841303", "9841599", "9834754", "9732337", "9737829", "9653594", "9663364", "9571335", "9539999", "9538975", "9314014", "9250229", "8908379", "8944206", "8911977", "8864639", "7623902", "7656891", "8529495", "7662221", "7733122", "8075474", "8167461", "2192851", "2671740", "3518443", "7566020", "8842603", "9742976", "1280574", "8706591", "9561345", "7968073", "9589648"], "inbound_citations": ["31520325", "30474818", "29231750"], "label": "1"}

DATA SOURCES: Primary and review articles regarding nateglinide were identified by MEDLINE search (from 1966 to January 2001); abstracts were identified through the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science (from 1995 to January 2001) and the American Diabetes Association; additional information was obtained from the nateglinide product information. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: All articles and meeting abstracts identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. Much of the information was from abstracts or the product labeling, since few clinical studies have been published in the medical literature. DATA SYNTHESIS: Nateglinide is a novel nonsulfonylurea oral antidiabetic agent that stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreas. It has a rapid onset and short duration of action, allowing administration before a meal to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia. Improvement in glycemic control with nateglinide monotherapy has been demonstrated in patients not previously treated with antidiabetic medications. Greater improvement in glycemic control was observed when nateglinide was administered in combination with metformin. CONCLUSIONS: Nateglinide is similar to repaglinide, but has a quicker onset of action, quicker reversal, and does not usually require dosage titration. Based on the pharmacodynamics of nateglinide and repaglinide, nateglinide produces a more rapid postprandial increase in insulin secretion, and its duration of response is shorter than that of repaglinide. The risk of postabsorptive hypoglycemia should be lower than with either sulfonylureas or repaglinide.", "outbound_citations": ["11194245", "11200947", "11092289", "10868314", "10773014", "10877006", "10784228", "10868864", "10720043", "10868832", "10565863", "10372242", "11563410", "9702426", "9405900", "8894500"], "inbound_citations": ["35932448", "33270252", "31863220"], "label": "1"}

Serum insulin-concentration time series were assessed by deconvolution analyses and the regularity statistic by approximate entropy (ApEn).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAverage insulin concentration was increased after repaglinide administration (basal vs. stimulated period, P values are placebo vs. repaglinide) (25.1 +/- 3.6 vs. 33.5 +/- 4.1 pmol/l, P < 0.001). Insulin secretory burst mass (15.8 +/- 2.2 vs. 19.6 +/- 2.8 pmol x l(-1) x pulse(-1), P = 0.02) and amplitude (6.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.7 +/- 1.2 pmol x l(-1) x min(-1), P = 0.008) were augmented after repaglinide administration. A concomitant trend toward an increase in basal insulin secretion was observed (2.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.4 pmol x l(-1) x min(-1), p = 0.06), while the interpulse interval was unaltered (6.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.4 min/pulse, P = 0.38). ApEn increased significantly after repaglinide administration (0.623 +/- 0.045 vs. 0.670 +/- 0.034, P = 0.04), suggesting less orderly oscillatory patterns of insulin release.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, a single dose of repaglinide amplifies insulin secretory burst mass (and basal secretion) with no change in burst frequency. The possible importance of these mechanisms in the treatment of type 2 diabetes characterized by disrupted pulsatile insulin secretion remains to be clarified.", "outbound_citations": ["10567024", "10372723", "9868989", "9703327", "9703380", "9519738", "9534008", "9421373", "29585515", "9329378", "9287034", "9124326", "8922367", "8943067", "8826965", "8764190", "8772482", "7913205", "8204328", "8472350", "1551497", "11607165", "3283554", "3283553", "2823271", "3525288", "3000741", "3511094", "6134649", "7014311", "6997329", "386121", "401543"], "inbound_citations": ["33833686", "31884929", "30235745", "31050588", "25637831", "25044176", "22386942", "18570623", "17456637", "17443551", "16735959", "16278244", "16176204"], "label": "1"}

The group consisted of 12 obese subjects (seven women, five men; mean +/- SD age, 53.5 +/- 8.5 years; total body weight (TBW), 95.5 +/- 17.2 kg; percentage > IBW (ideal body weight), 57.8 +/- 31.7%); and eight nonobese subjects (two women, six men; age, 57.8 +/- 11.7 years; TBW, 80.8 +/- 9.9 kg; percentage > IBW, 15.6 +/- 10.3%). After a 2-week antidiabetic drug-free period, patients were started on glipizide therapy for 12 weeks. Glipizide dosages were titrated to achieve specified therapeutic goals or a maximum daily dose of 40 mg. Glipizide pharmacokinetics were assessed by serum concentrations obtained during a 24-h pharmacokinetic evaluation performed after the first 5-mg dose (SD) and after 12 weeks of chronic therapy (CD). Glipizide pharmacodynamics were evaluated with serum glucose, insulin, and C-peptide responses to Sustacal tolerance test done at baseline, after SD, and after CD. No statistically significant differences in the SD pharmacokinetic parameters (Tmax = 3.1 +/- 1.2 vs. 2.8 +/- 1.6 h; Cmax = 332.5 +/- 92.5 vs. 420.8 +/- 142 g/L; area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCI) = 2,598.3 +/- 1,148 vs. 3,138.9 +/- 1,847 g/h/L; oral clearance/bioavailability (CL/F), 2.3 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.0 +/- 1.0 L/h; volume of distribution/bioavailability (V/F), 19.5 +/- 4.4 vs. 17.2 +/- 4.3 L; t1/2 = 5.0 +/- 2.3 vs. 5.2 +/- 2.0 h) were observed between the obese and nonobese groups, respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed under CD conditions were also closely matched in the two groups. No differences in glucose responses to Sustacal challenge at baseline, SD, and CD (AUC0-->4.glucose:baseline, 52.3 +/- 18.0 vs. 44.9 +/- 9.8; SD, 50.4 +/- 20.9 vs. 36.1 +/- 11.0; CD, 37.8 +/- 10.7 vs. 36.6 +/- 8.5 mM/h) were noted between the obese and nonobese groups, respectively. However, glucose concentrations increased more and decreased to a smaller extent after SD in the obese as compared to nonobese subjects. Mean fasting serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations were not statistically different between the two groups. However, obese subjects exhibited higher fasting insulin (114.0 +/- 69 vs. 68.8 +/- 52 pM) at week 12 evaluation and C-peptide concentrations (0.83 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.2 nM) after SD as compared to the nonobese group. A smaller percentage increase in C peptide in response to Sustacal challenge was observed in the obese compared to the nonobese subjects (baseline, 60 +/- 25 vs. 117 +/- 117; SD, 119 +/- 39 vs. 193 +/- 149; and CD, 97 +/- 56 vs. 163 +/- 67%).

More than 90% of the estimated 200 million affected persons with diabetes worldwide have type 2 DM, an often clinically silent disorder. In the United States, nearly half of the estimated 16 million persons with diabetes remain undiagnosed. Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a long period of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a potentially reversible metabolic state associated with increased risk for macrovascular complications. At the time of diagnosis more than one-third of patients have already developed long-term complications of diabetes. Genetic and acquired factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The pathophysiological hallmarks consist of progressive insulin resistance, pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, and excessive hepatic glucose production. The ideal treatment for type 2 diabetes should correct insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and normalize hepatic glucose output, as well as prevent, delay, or reverse diabetic complications. Emerging targets for therapy of type 2 diabetes include inhibition of gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation, as well as stimulation of beta3-adrenergic receptors. Drug intervention for obesity is a legitimate adjunct to diabetes management. Additional drug targets include interventions to prevent or delay the progression of specific complications. Finally, primary prevention of type 2 diabetes is an important emerging strategy. The specific pharmacological agents acting at the various targets are discussed in this review.

The synergistic effects of combining glipizide with metformin on glucose control may be realized by treating the primary effects of type 2 DM, impaired insulin secretion, and insulin resistance. This study assessed therapy with glipizide/metformin combination tablets in patients with type 2 DM that is uncontrolled by at least half the maximum labeled daily dose of a sulfonylurea. In this multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, active-controlled study, patients were randomized to receive glipizide 30-mg, metformin 500-mg, or glipizide/metformin 5/500 mg tablets for 18 weeks (metformin and glipizide/metformin doses were titrated to achieve blood glucose control). Maximum total daily doses were glipizide 30 mg, metformin 2000 mg, and glipizide/ metformin 20/2000 mg. A total of 247 patients were included in the study. The mean (SD) age was 56.2 (10.1) years; 61.5% of patients were male; 70.0% were white, 15.8% were Hispanic/Latino, 13.0% were black, and 1.2% were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Patients were, on average, obese (mean [SD] body mass index, 31.3 [4.7] kg/m2), had moderate to severe hyperglycemia (mean [SD] glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 8.7% [1.1]), and had a mean (SD) DM duration of 6.5 (4.9) years. Glipizide/ metformin tablets controlled the HbA1c level more effectively than did either glipizide or metformin monotherapies (mean treatment differences, in favor of glipizide/ metformin, of -1.06% and -0.98%, respectively, P < 0.001). At study end, an HbA1c level < 7.0% was achieved in approximately 4-fold more patients who were treated with glipizide/metformin (36.3%) compared with glipizide (8.9%) or metformin (9.9%) monotherapies. Glipizide/metformin tablets also reduced the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level and the 3-hour postprandial glucose area under the concentration-time curve more effectively than did either monotherapy, without increasing the fasting insulin level. The greater blood glucose control with glipizide/ metformin tablets was achieved at a mean daily dose of glipizide/metformin 17.5/1747 mg, compared with mean doses of glipizide 30.0 mg or metformin 1927 mg. Treatments were well tolerated, with a low incidence of symptoms of hypoglycemia evidenced by a fingerstick blood glucose measurement < or = 50 mg/dL in the combination group (12.6%); 1 patient discontinued the study treatment for this reason. No patient required medical assistance for hypoglycemia. Glipizide/metformin tablets were more effective than either glipizide or metformin monotherapy in controlling HbA1c and in reducing FPG compared with baseline in patients with blood glucose that was uncontrolled with previous sulfonylurea treatment. In addition, patients receiving glipizide/ metformin were more likely to achieve an HbA1c level < 7.0%. These results were consistent with the synergistic effects on insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Glipizide/metformin was well tolerated, with a low incidence of hypoglycemia.", "outbound_citations": ["12406033", "12147149", "12047399", "11939679", "11424231", "10938048", "10877745", "10359389", "9742977", "9585394", "9051403", "7623902", "7895460", "7848543", "2611321"], "inbound_citations": ["32008249", "30668423", "31326458", "29527355", "29379326", "29535952"], "label": "1"}

It differs from the sulfonylureas in that it is does not enhance insulin secretion and normally does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin acts to decrease preprandial and postprandial blood glucose concentrations by increasing skeletal muscle uptake of glucose, decreasing gluconeogenesis, and decreasing absorption of glucose. The addition of metformin to maximum dosages of a sulfonylurea may synergistically improve glucose control. The drug may offer other potential benefits, such as weight loss or minimal weight gain, improved blood flow in patients with peripheral vascular disease, reduction of tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor, and improved lipid profiles. It is relatively safe if taken appropriately. Its most common side effects are gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, anorexia), metallic taste, and vitamin B12 malabsorption. Lactic acidosis may also occur, but it is rare if metformin is avoided in patients with contraindications to its use.

Zinman recalled Joslin's early assertion: \"The goal of appropriate therapy for those with diabetes should include a serious effort to achieve glucose as close to the normal as feasible.\" More than 70 years after the first therapeutic use of insulin, we are continuing our incremental steps toward the application of this principle to the treatment of the illness. The first dose of insulin was given on January 11, 1922, but, commented Zinman, \"We're still struggling to obtain physiologic replacement.\" A recent analysis of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) results suggests that intensive treatment will add 5.2 years of sight, 6.6 years of renal function, 5.2 years of limb preservation, and 3.0 years of life to the individual who develops type 1 diabetes. Currently, however, 25% of individuals with type I diabetes in the U.S. are treated with one dose of insulin and 61% with two doses; therefore, at most, 14% of patients receive intensive treatment with regimens of three or four injections per day and frequent home glucose monitoring. Zinman stressed the inefficiency of our current methods of administering subcutaneous insulin. After a subcutaneous injection of regular insulin, the intrasubject coefficient of variation of the peak insulin level is 39%, and that of the time to peak is 51%. The area under the curve varies by 44%, and the variation in amount of glucose required to maintain euglycemia is 35%. Taking the latter figure as the most conservative estimate, if one administers 20 U, at times the actual dose will be 14 U and at times it will be 26 U! Future approaches may range from changing the route of insulin administration, with intraperitoneal, intranasal, and oral dosing being explored, to genetic treatment to cause resumption of endogenous insulin secretion. A promising approach currently being explored involves the administration of modified insulins. The ideal premeal insulin will be administered immediately before eating and will have a rapid onset and a short duration of action. In contrast, the ideal basal insulin will be slow in onset, with little or no \"peaking\" and with a long duration of action. Both will need to be mixable and stable, with consistent kinetics of action. A candidate premeal insulin is \"LysPro\" insulin, with two consecutive amino acids on the B-chain, a lysine and a praline, exchanged to prevent the insulin from self-associating into the hexameric form. Zinman stated that this insulin would soon be marketed by Eli Lily under the brand name \"Humalog.\" A \"basal insulin\" under development by Novo Nordisk increases the stability of the hexameric association of insulin. This Cobalt III insulin, with two cobalt atoms in the center of the hexamer, is rapidly absorbed, so variations in subcutaneous absorption are not seen. The complexes dissociate slowly in the circulation, leading to prolonged action. Michael P. Stern, San Antonio, TX, reviewed the topic of whether exogenous insulin causes macrovascular dis-", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Setting: 20 hospital based clinics in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Subjects: 1148 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 56, mean blood pressure at entry 160/94 mm Hg); 758 patients were allocated to tight control of blood pressure and 390 patients to less tight control with a median follow up of 8.4 years. Main outcome measures: Predefined clinical end points, fatal and non-fatal, related to diabetes, deaths related to diabetes, and all cause mortality. Surrogate measures of microvascular disease included urinary albumin excretion and retinal photography. Results: Mean blood pressure during follow up was significantly reduced in the group assigned tight blood pressure control (144/82 mm Hg) compared with the group assigned to less tight control (154/87 mm Hg) (P<0.0001). Reductions in risk in the group assigned to tight control compared with that assigned to less tight control were 24% in diabetes related end points (95% confidence interval 8% to 38%) (P=0.0046), 32% in deaths related to diabetes (6% to 51%) (P=0.019), 44% in strokes (11% to 65%) (P=0.013), and 37% in microvascular end points (11% to 56%) (P=0.0092), predominantly owing to a reduced risk of retinal photocoagulation. There was a non-significant reduction in all cause mortality. After nine years of follow up the group assigned to tight blood pressure control also had a 34% reduction in risk in the proportion of patients with deterioration of retinopathy by two steps (99% confidence interval 11% to 50%) (P=0.0004) and a 47% reduced risk (7% to 70%) (P=0.004) of deterioration in visual acuity by three lines of the early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart. After nine years of follow up 29% of patients in the group assigned to tight control required three or more treatments to lower blood pressure to achieve target blood pressures. Conclusion: Tight blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes achieves a clinically important reduction in the risk of deaths related to diabetes, complications related to diabetes, progression of diabetic retinopathy, and deterioration in visual acuity.", "outbound_citations": ["9732338", "9635947", "9549452", "9514482", "2721345", "8968014", "8929360", "8697298",

This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the efficacy and safety of diet alone, acarbose, tolbutamide, and acarbose-plus-tolbutamide in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients. A total of 290 patients with NIDDM and fasting plasma glucose levels of at least 140 mg/dL were randomized to receive treatment TID with acarbose 200 mg, tolbutamide 250 to 1,000 mg, a combination of both drugs, or placebo. A 6-week run-in period was followed by double-blind treatment for 24 weeks, then a 6-week follow-up period. All active treatments were superior (P < 0.05) to placebo in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia and HbA1c levels. The ranking in order of efficacy was: acarbose-plus-tolbutamide, tolbutamide, acarbose, and placebo. The postprandial reductions in glucose were approximately 85 mg/dL for acarbose-plus-tolbutamide, 71 mg/dL for tolbutamide, 56 mg/dL for acarbose, and 13 mg/dL for placebo. Tolbutamide was associated with increases in body weight and postprandial insulin levels when taken alone, but these were ameliorated when tolbutamide was taken in combination with acarbose. Acarbose alone or in combination with tolbutamide caused significantly more gastrointestinal adverse events (mainly flatulence and soft stools or diarrhea) than tolbutamide or placebo, but these were generally well tolerated. Clinically significant elevations in hepatic transaminase levels occurred in 3 patients in the acarbose group and 2 in the acarbose-plus-tolbutamide group.

Each clinical trial had a duration of 16 weeks with a 1-week washout, 3-week single-blind placebo phase, 4-week titration to a fixed dose, and 8-week maintenance phase at the assigned dose. In the first trial, once-daily doses of 5, 20, 40, or 60 mg glipizide GITS were compared with placebo in 143 patients. In the second trial, doses of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg of glipizide GITS were compared with placebo in 204 patients. HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, C-peptide, and glipizide levels were determined at regular intervals throughout the study. Postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), insulin, and C-peptide also were determined at 1 and 2 h after a mixed meal (Sustacal).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll doses of glipizide GITS in both trials produced significant reductions from placebo in FPG (range -57 to -74 mg/dl) and HbA1c (range -1.50 to -1.82%). Pharmacodynamic analysis indicated a significant relationship between plasma glipizide concentration and reduction in FPG and HbA1c over a dose range of 5-60 mg, with maximal efficacy achieved at a dose of 20 mg for FPG and at 5 mg for HbA1c. PPG levels were significantly lower, and both postprandial insulin and C-peptide levels significantly higher in patients treated with glipizide GITS compared with placebo. The percent reduction in FPG was comparable across patients with diverse demographic and clinical characteristics, including those with entry FPG > or = 250 mg/dl, resulting in greater absolute decreases in FPG and HbA1c in patients with the most severe hyperglycemia. Despite the forced titration to a randomly assigned dose, only 11 patients in both studies discontinued therapy because of hypoglycemia. Glipizide GITS did not alter lipids levels or produce weight gain.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe once-daily glipizide GITS 1) lowered HbA1c, FPG, and PPG over a dose range of 5-60 mg, 2) was maximally effective at 5 mg (using HbA1c) or 20 mg (using FPG) based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships, 3) maintained its effectiveness in poorly controlled patients (those with entry FPG > or = 250 mg/dl), 4) was safe and well tolerated in a wide variety of patients with NIDDM, and 5) did not produce weight gain or adversely affect lipids.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33190640", "32026779"], "label": "1"}

Patients were free to choose a flexible meal pattern, adjusting the dosing schedule from two to four preprandial doses per day in accordance with a \"one meal, one dose; no meal, no dose\" principle. Additional snacks were not a requirement of the treatment schedule.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment with repaglinide significantly improved glycemic control with respect to baseline and placebo, reducing HbA1c by 1.14% from baseline and fasting plasma glucose by 1.8 mmol/l. Improvement in glycemic control was independent of the meal pattern adopted by patients, including those most commonly taking two or four meals daily, with no correlation between meal pattern and risk of hypoglycemia. The improvement in glycemic control was also independent of degree of obesity and age < or =65 or >65 years.

Left ventricular (LV) mass index, ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic volume were assessed by M-mode echocardiography at baseline and weeks 12, 28, and 52; 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was assessed at baseline and at weeks 28 and 52. Glycemic control was assessed by measuring fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA(1c).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNeither treatment produced an increase in LV mass index that exceeded 1 SD. Ejection fraction did not change in either group. Both groups had clinically insignificant increases in LV end-diastolic volume. RSG, but not GLB, caused a statistically significant reduction in ambulatory diastolic blood pressure. Both treatments reduced HbA(1c) and FPG.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA total of 52 weeks of therapy with RSG (4 mg b.i.d.) did not adversely affect cardiac structure or function in patients with type 2 diabetes and produced significant and sustained reductions in hyperglycemia. Decreases in ambulatory diastolic blood pressure with RSG were superior to those with GLB.", "outbound_citations": ["11272161", "11213884", "11232013", "10988277", "10926309", "10406828", "10225476", "10335903", "10446691", "10227562", "9752901", "9588454", "9287037", "7794582", "8387089", "1600834", "2936235", "6519752", "6687472", "688245"], "inbound_citations": ["31969144", "31284526", "30843294", "30758422", "30261876", "29419672", "28920861"], "label": "0"}

Oral antidiabetic drugs include: 1) biguanides acting through the reduction of hepatic glucose production and are most efficient in obese patients; 2) alpha-glucosidase inhibitors delaying carbohydrate intestinal absorption; 3) thiazolidinediones or \"glitazones\", acting as insulin sensitizers; 4) insulin secretion enhancers, mainly including sulfonylureas, which increase insulin secretion and are being credited by a long clinical usage; these are now joined by the new generation of insulin secretion enhancers, led by repaglinide, which can mimic the physiological insulin secretion profile by a specific stimulatory effect on beta-cells characterized by its fast onset and short half-life.

We studied the effects of erythromycin on insulin secretion and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus. Inpatients (n = 34) with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to receive either erythromycin (400 mg orally three times a day, n = 19) or a placebo (n = 15) for 1 week (first study). Another 34 outpatients with Type II diabetes were also treated with erythromycin (200 mg orally three times a day, n = 17) or a placebo (n = 17) for 4 weeks (second study). Finally, nine inpatients with Type II diabetes and eight normal control subjects received intravenous erythromycin (10 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) or saline infusion and insulin secretion was examined (third study). Erythromycin lowered fasting blood glucose and fructosamine concentrations (p < 0.01) and increased basal as well as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (p <0.05-0.01) (first study). Low doses of erythromycin treatment for 4 weeks also significantly improved glycaemic control in Type II diabetic patients (second study). Erythromycin infusion significantly increased plasma insulin and decreased glucose concentrations in Type II diabetic and control subjects and greatly potentiated glucose-induced insulin secretion in the latter (third study).

This phenomenon led Levy and Gavin [7] to propose that many of the complications of diabetes mellitus are, at least in part, related to an elevation in [Ca2+]i levels. This is plausible because other conditions in which [Ca2+]i levels are elevated, such as chronic renal failure [8] and phosphate depletion [9-12], are associated with organ dysfunctions similar to those seen with diabetes mellitus. However, a relation between the elevation in [Ca2+]i levels and a specific cell dysfunction in diabetes mellitus has not yet been documented. The mechanisms responsible for the elevation in [Ca2+]i levels in patients with diabetes mellitus are not known. Hyperglycemia may be associated with increased calcium influx into cells and a corresponding increase in [Ca2+]i levels [13]. However, data on the relation among the degree of hyperglycemia, the magnitude of the increase in [Ca2+]i, and cell dysfunction are not available. Furthermore, it is not known whether the reversal of hyperglycemia by insulin therapy or by the use of oral hypoglycemic agents is followed by the return of [Ca2+]i levels and cell function to normal. Phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) is impaired in patients with IDDM and NIDDM [14, 15]. However, data on [Ca2+]i levels in PMNLs and on the relations among hyperglycemia, [Ca2+]i levels in PMNLs, and phagocytosis are not available. The study of these accessible cells in patients with diabetes mellitus may provide an opportunity to explore these issues. We therefore examined PMNLs from patients newly diagnosed with NIDDM in order to delineate the interactions among hyperglycemia, [Ca2+]i levels, and phagocytosis. Methods We studied 22 controls and 34 patients with NIDDM to evaluate [Ca2+]i levels and phagocytosis in PMNLs. At the time of diagnosis, we obtained blood samples for the study of PMNL metabolism and function. All patients received the oral hyperglycemic agent glyburide (5 to 20 mg/d; mean dose, 7 2.8 mg/d). Only 15 patients returned for follow-up after 3 months of therapy with this drug; no specific reasons were given for why the remaining 19 patients did not return for follow-up. All biochemical variables were assessed in the patients but not in the controls. The normal values for our laboratory are provided. Separation of Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes Peripheral venous blood was drawn under sterile conditions into vacutainers containing 20 U of preservative-free heparin (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, New York) per 1.0 mL of blood. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were isolated from the whole blood according to the method described by Ferrante and Thong [16]. Fresh heparinized blood was layered in 3.5-mL aliquots over Ficoll-Hypaque solution with a density of 1.114 g/mL (Mono-Poly Resolving Medium, Flow Laboratories, McLean, Virginia) and centrifuged at 300 g for 35 min at room temperature. This procedure resulted in the separation of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells into two distinct bands, with the red blood cell pellet at the bottom of the tube. The PMNL layer was aspirated with a Pasteur pipette and washed twice in Hanks balanced salt solution. The purity of cells as determined by Wright stain was greater than 97%, and the viability of cells exceeded 98% as assayed by the trypan blue exclusion method. Determination of Phagocytosis We estimated the rate of ingestion by PMNLs spectrophotometrically according to the bioassay described by Southwick and Stossel [17]. Briefly, PMNLs were fed oil droplets containing oil red O and coated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (2 mg per experiment). These particles were previously opsonized in fresh autologous serum. After the PMNLs and the particles were incubated for 5 min at 37 C, the reaction was rapidly stopped by adding ice-cold isotonic saline that contained 1 mmol/L N-ethylmaleimide, which poisons the cells and stops ingestion. Uningested particles were separated from cells that contained ingested particles by centrifugation at 250 g for 10 min. Oil red O was extracted from the cell pellet with dioxane, and the optical density of the extract was measured using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 2 UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, Connecticut) at a wavelength of 525 nm. The ingestion rate was expressed in micrograms of oil engulfed per 107PMNLs per minute. We purchased all reagents from Aldrich Chemical (Milwaukee, Wisconsin). Lipopolysaccharide E. coli 026:B6 was obtained from Boivin preparation (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan). Assay of Adenosine Triphosphate in Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes We measured the ATP content of PMNLs according to the method described by Lundin and colleagues [18]. We added an aliquot of 0.5 mL of 0.6 M ice-cold perchloric acid to 5 106PMNLs in 0.5 mL of RPMI (Gibco Laboratories). After 10 minutes of extraction on ice, we added 62.5 L of 2 M potassium carbonate, and the mixture was centrifuged at 10 500 g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at 70 C. On the day of the assay, we added 50 L of the supernatant to 950 L of 40 mmol/L Tris buffer (pH, 7.4) and diluted this mixture 20 times with distilled water. Samples of 50 L were assayed for ATP by the firefly luciferase assay with LAD 535 luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, California). Adenosine triphosphate standards were prepared with 40 mmol/L Tris buffer, distilled water, and amounts of RPMI, perchloric acid, and potassium carbonate similar to those in the PMNL preparation. Measurements of Cytosolic Calcium We measured resting levels of [Ca2+]i in PMNLs with Fura 2-AM (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri). A sample of 5 106PMNLs was washed with solution 1, which contained 132 mmol/L sodium chloride; 3 mmol/L potassium chloride; 1 mmol/L magnesium sulfate; 1.2 mmol/L monosodium acid phosphate; 10 mmol/L D-glucose; 10 mmol/L Hepes; and 0.02 mmol/L calcium chloride (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris buffer) and was then spun at 300 g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 490 L of this solution and 10 L of Fura 2-AM dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, giving a final concentration of 4 mol/L of Fura 2. The mixture was then incubated in a water bath of 37 C for 30 minutes. After this incubation, the cells were washed and resuspended in solution 1. Cytosolic calcium levels were measured with Perkin Elmer fluorescence spectrophotometer (model LS 513) at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm, with slits of 10 mm and 20 mm, respectively. We added a 100- L aliquot of the PMNL suspension to a spectrophotometer cuvette that contained 1.9 mL of solution 2, which was the same as solution 1 except that its calcium chloride concentration was 1 mmol/L. Autofluorescence from cells or added reagents (or both) was monitored during each experiment and was not found to be a significant factor. We evaluated maximal fluorescence and minimal fluorescence with 0.05% Triton and 5 mmol/L ethylene glycol tetra-acetic acid in Tris base buffer (pH, 8.0), respectively. Cytosolic calcium was calculated using the Grynkiewicz equation [19], and the dissociation constant for Ca2+-Fura 2 was assumed to be 225 nmol/L. Biochemical Measurements The concentration of calcium in serum was determined by Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer model 505 of phosphorus; that of creatinine by an autoanalyzer (Technicon, Tarrytown, New York); that of serum glucose by a multichannel analyzer (Beckman, Irvine, California); and that of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by an ion exchange chromatography according to a modification of the method of Trivelli and colleagues [20]. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were estimated with radioisotopic assay (Intact PTH-Nichols Institute Diagnostics). The normal value of PTH is 10 to 65 pg/mL. Statistical analysis was done using a paired and an unpaired t-test, and the relation between two variables was determined by the correlation coefficient. Data are reported as mean SD unless otherwise specified. Results The study included 22 controls and 34 patients with NIDDM. The patients were examined at the time of their visit to the outpatient clinic and consisted of 20 women and 14 men (mean age, 45 12.8 years; range, 30 to 71 years). No patients had infection, nor were they receiving any medications. The diagnosis of NIDDM was made by measurements of fasting hyperglycemia in the absence of ketonemia [21]. However, some of these patients may have had late-onset IDDM. All patients had normal blood pressure (mean, 127 19.8/77 11.1 mm Hg). The mean body mass index was 32.6 9.3 kg/m2 for women and 30.0 6.4 kg/m2 for men. The body mass index was normal in 2 women, in the overweight range in 4, and in the obese range in 11. It was normal in 2 men, in the over-weight range in 7, and in the obese range in 8. Table 1 provides the clinical and biochemical data of the patients at the time of diagnosis. They had hyperglycemia, elevated blood levels of HbA1c, normal blood levels of creatinine and PTH, and blood cholesterol levels in the upper normal range. Ten patients had elevated blood levels of triglycerides, 19 patients had elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and 16 patients had decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The controls were 9 women and 13 men (mean age, 35 4.9 years; range, 26 to 45 years). Table 1. Biochemical Profile of Patients with Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus* In the patients with NIDDM, the basal [Ca2+]i levels in PMNLs (68 9.6 nmol/L) were significantly higher than those in the controls (43 4.9 nmol/L) (P < 0.01) (Figure 1). We observed a direct and significant correlation between [Ca2+]i levels in PMNLs and fasting serum glucose levels (r = 0.80; P < 0.01) (Figure 2).

This oral antihyperglycaemic agent is indicated for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Miglitol is generally well tolerated and, unlike the sulphonylurea agents, is not associated with bodyweight gain or hypoglycaemia when administered as monotherapy. The drug is systemically absorbed but is not metabolised and is rapidly excreted via the kidneys. Clinical trials with miglitol (usually 50 or 100 mg 3 times daily) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus consistently demonstrated a significant improvement in glycaemic control for periods of 6 to 12 months. There were also marked reductions in postprandial serum insulin levels, although miglitol generally had no effect on fasting insulin levels. In comparative studies miglitol had similar efficacy to acarbose, but at lower therapeutic doses (50 and 100 mg 3 times daily, respectively). In addition, although sulphonylurea agents provided superior reductions in HbA1c levels, miglitol provided similar or superior reductions in fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels. In combination with other oral antidiabetic agents or insulin, miglitol improved glycaemic control in patients in whom metabolic control was suboptimal despite dietary and pharmacological intervention. Most adverse events associated with miglitol treatment involve disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract (most common effects are flatulence, abdominal pain and diarrhoea). These symptoms are usually dose dependent, mild to moderate in severity, occur at the onset of treatment, decline with time and resolve promptly on discontinuation of the drug or with dosage adjustment. As monotherapy, miglitol is not associated with hypoglycaemia, but concomitant use with other oral antidiabetic agents may necessitate dosage adjustment of the other agents. Miglitol had no significant effects on renal, cardiovascular, respiratory or haematological parameters in long term studies. No dosage adjustments are required in elderly patients, in those with hepatic impairment or in those with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. In long term, well designed trials miglitol reduces fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels, thus improving glycaemic control, which is reflected in a reduced HbA1c level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Most adverse events associated with miglitol involve disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract.

During aging, glucose intolerance will gradually develop, and this is manifested primarily by an increase in the postprandial blood glucose response while fasting blood glucose levels are often less elevated. Abnormal beta-cell secretion of insulin is a main feature of this. Treatment of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus focuses on reduction of (hyperglycaemic) complaints and prevention of the development or progression of secondary complications. Although regular physical activity and dietary measures, aiming at bodyweight normalisation, are the cornerstones of therapy, pharmacological treatment with oral blood glucose lowering-agents often proves necessary to control the hyperglycaemia. In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) it was clearly shown that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were intensively treated with oral blood glucose-lowering agents or insulin developed less microvascular complications. The question whether achievement of strict metabolic control is also of benefit in elderly patients, is still unanswered. Sulphonylureas are drugs which stimulate insulin secretion by enhancing the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta-cells without an effect on insulin synthesis. They are frequently used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and several preparations are available. In general, there are no major differences in effectiveness between the various sulphonylureas. Long term treatment with sulphonylureas will decrease fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels by 3 to 5 mmol/L, and glycosylated haemoglobin by 20%. However, after its initial decline, plasma glucose level will often go up slightly during the following months to years. Sulphonylureas are usually well tolerated. Hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring adverse effect, which may be very serious and damaging in the elderly. It has been associated primarily with long-acting sulphonylureas, like chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (glyburide). Hypoglycaemic episodes may trigger serious events like myocardial infarction or stroke. Therefore, shorter-acting compounds like tolbutamide and gliclazide have been relatively well tolerated and appear to be the best choice to treat elderly patients. It is advisable to start with a low dose and increase the dose, when needed, in small steps. The efficacy of sulphonylureas is much greater when they are taken before a meal. Because of the fact that type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease, and residual beta-cell function decreases with time, insulin therapy may ultimately be warranted in a significant number of patients.", "outbound_citations": ["10593133", "9742977", "9561345", "9571335", "9450510", "9314626", "9250229", "9143853", "8941458", "8675920", "8666147", "8758009", "8740326", "7895463", "8039601", "7956677", "8112188", "8312676", "8111800", "7691511", "8462623", "1357346", "1532777", "1737544", "1907234", "1872308", "2030287", "1828740", "2684711", "2693502", "2677730", "2664520", "2668699", "2967151", "2964326", "3310623", "3817306", "3552537", "2412077", "3935376", "6656850", "6765225", "7121526", "6759249", "7019248", "6776763", "116480", "116387", "215396", "1106937", "1091759", "4926376", "3936738", "6989693", "6411511", "2192847", "9742976", "9506242", "9203460", "3289989", "2201501", "1425483", "6376034", "2651086", "7040951", "6988265", "8223830", "640303", "2379540", "3888754", "8582126"], "inbound_citations": ["35831938", "31586319", "31692384", "30682693", "30205233", "26123984", "23953074", "22660215", "15200348", "19923032", "19788431", "20129254", "19275459", "17931573", "17727304", "16501671", "16415772", "16356235"], "label": "0"}

The mechanism for this difference is unclear. We have investigated in a cross\u2010over study the effect of sulphonylurea and metformin therapy on energy expenditure and body composition in 10 Type 2 diabetic patients (7 females, 3 males) of various weights (mean body mass index 33.4 (SD 7.6 kg m\u22122)). Free living total energy expenditure was measured over 14 days by the doubly labelled water method adjusted for urinary glucose energy losses and resting energy expenditure by ventilated hood indirect calorimetry. Overall, total energy expenditure (12.88 \u00b1 4.17 vs 13.1 \u00b1 3.69 MJ 24 h\u22121) and resting metabolic rate (7.30 \u00b1 1.75 vs 7.23 \u00b1 1.74 MJ 24 h\u22121) were similar on metformin and sulphonylurea therapy, respectively.

Fat free mass also increased significantly by 1.3 kg (95% CI 0.4, 2.4 kg, p < 0.05) when on sulphonylurea therapy, thus compensating for the lower resting metabolic rate per kg fat free mass to leave overall resting metabolic rate unchanged compared to metformin therapy. We also investigated the effect of adding metformin to six Type 2 diabetic patients already on insulin. This did not lead to any measurable changes in any of the components of energy expenditure. Our results suggested that the weight gain of 0.8 kg with sulphonylurea was secondary to a relatively greater energy intake and/or metabolizable energy availability, possibly augmented by a slightly lower resting metabolic rate when adjusted for differences in fat free mass.", "outbound_citations": ["7918326", "8243815", "8237862", "8261755", "1600835", "1600834", "1955512", "1828732", "2305701", "2655422", "3142975", "3310940", "3298320", "3578092", "3094802", "3771290", "3085521", "3908486", "6158385", "589351", "594027", "4233287", "4169605", "15394301"], "inbound_citations": ["33652754", "32863304", "32416957", "32172232", "29029859"], "label": "0"}

The hydrophilic matrix of hypromellose-based polymer in the new formulation effects a progressive release of the drug which parallels the 24-hour glycaemic profile in untreated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The formulation shows high bioavailability and its absorption profile is unaffected by coadministration with food. Mean plasma glucose levels are significantly reduced over a 24-hour period in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with gliclazide MR once daily, in both fasting and postprandial states. No cardiovascular ATP-sensitive potassium channel interaction has been observed at therapeutic concentrations of gliclazide MR. Gliclazide MR has also demonstrated antioxidant properties that are independent of glycaemic control. In a randomised, double-blind, multicentre study, gliclazide MR 30 to 120 mg once daily showed similar efficacy to gliclazide immediate release (IR) 80 to 320 mg/day (in divided doses for doses >80 mg) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus over a 10-month period, reducing glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to a similar extent. The drug appeared most efficacious in patients who had previously been treated by diet alone, where significant reductions in HbA(1c) from baseline of 0.9% and 0.95% were seen at 10 and 24 months. Similarly, a sustained effect of gliclazide MR was observed in a subgroup of elderly patients defined a priori; HbA(1c) was decreased to a similar degree to that observed in the general study population. Gliclazide MR showed similar tolerability to gliclazide IR after 10 months' treatment in the randomised trial. The most commonly observed adverse events were arthralgia, arthritis, back pain and bronchitis (each <5%). Bodyweight remained stable. In this study no episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemia requiring third party assistance were observed during treatment with gliclazide MR. Episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia were infrequent, occurring in approximately 5% of patients.", "outbound_citations": ["10576528", "12015189", "12015789", "12107755", "11574406", "11484080", "11398146", "11353879", "11078469", "11004429", "11004430", "11004426", "11004432", "10693914", "10663220", "10440127", "11220509", "10069357", "9834725", "9834731", "9726229", "9571335", "2721345", "9439554", "9439552", "9322798", "7833495", "1289021", "1800127", "1794262", "11596665", "10510947"], "inbound_citations": ["36300277", "35746981", "34758676", "34730455", "34698608", "33921149", "33693776", "32440835", "32360661", "31758056", "31487953", "30119196", "28514939", "27800567", "26751978", "25062059", "24780925", "24844554", "24734054", "23461781", "23029622", "15200348", "15977973", "20520962"], "label": "1"}

Efficient GK activity is required for normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, postprandial hepatic glucose uptake, and the appropriate suppression of hepatic glucose output and gluconeogenesis by elevated plasma glucose. Hepatic GK activity is subnormal in diabetes, and GK may also be decreased in the beta cells of type II diabetics. In supraphysiological concentrations, biotin promotes the transcription and translation of the GK gene in hepatocytes; this effect appears to be mediated by activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. More recent evidence indicates that biotin likewise increases GK activity in islet cells. On the other hand, high-dose biotin suppresses hepatocyte transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme for gluconeogenesis. Administration of high-dose biotin has improved glycemic control in several diabetic animals models, and a recent Japanese clinical study concludes that biotin (3 mg t.i.d. orally) can substantially lower fasting glucose in type II diabetics, without side-effects. The recently demonstrated utility of chromium picolinate in type II diabetes appears to reflect improved peripheral insulin sensitivity--a parameter which is unlikely to be directly influenced by biotin. Thus, the joint administration of supranutritional doses of biotin and chromium picolinate is likely to combat insulin resistance, improve beta-cell function, enhance postprandial glucose uptake by both liver and skeletal muscle, and inhibit excessive hepatic glucose production. Conceivably, this safe, convenient, nutritional regimen will constitute a definitive therapy for many type II diabetics, and may likewise be useful in the prevention and management of gestational diabetes. Biotin should also aid glycemic control in type I patients.", "outbound_citations": ["10340287", "9681924", "9681923", "9293471", "9268917", "9176835", "9113996", "9162575", "9000695", "9056854", "9089478", "8878425", "8826967", "8692973", "8700908", "8617267", "8549869", "8820510", "7553875", "7665557", "7554777", "7720633", "7702608", "7729787", "8090784", "8168691", "7510884", "8299888", "8335003", "8392329", "8504825", "8433729", "8433089", "8422947", "1631055", "2037560", "2040395", "1825072", "2085665", "2557341", "3280936", "3032541", "6096365", "6327678", "6353247", "7173197", "7138021", "6127031", "6123152", "6257679", "7010598", "6261536", "115884", "701633", "10159", "183209", "4246111", "4296156", "5681418"], "inbound_citations": ["36386951", "33879509", "31076985"], "label": "0"}

Its purpose was to evaluate the relationship between insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) with regard to metabolic control and diabetic complications. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin for patients treated with insulin was 12.0 +/- 0.15% versus 11.4 +/- 0.14% (p < .03) for OHA. The difference in fasting blood sugar for the insulin-treated group (195.0 +/- 3.5 mg/dl) versus the OHA-treated group (194.0 +/- 2.9 mg/dl) was not statistically significant. Categorical increases in urinary albumin excretion were associated positively within insulin versus OHA therapy (p < .0001). Patients treated with insulin therapy had a higher frequency of peripheral vascular disease (insulin therapy, 14%; OHA therapy, 10%; p < .05); neuropathy (insulin therapy, 55%; OHA therapy, 37%; p < .0001); and retinopathy (insulin therapy, 71%; OHA therapy, 45%; p < .0001). The frequency of cardiovascular disease was equivalent in the two groups (17% versus 13%). In protocols correcting for diabetes duration, glycosylated hemoglobin, and gender in a multivariate model, the use of insulin still was related significantly to increases in urinary albumin excretion (p < .01), retinopathy (p < .0001), and neuropathy (p < .0008). In a subgroup of individuals with diabetes duration > 10 years (n = 211 for insulin treatment, n = 118 for OHA treatment), the frequency of neuropathy still was significantly higher in the insulin group (63% vs 49%; p < .016) as was retinopathy (85% vs 58%; p < .0001). Overt albuminuria also was more significant in the insulin-treated patients (p < .04). In summary, the NIDDM patients treated with insulin had more nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy than did NIDDM patients treated with OHA, independent of duration of diabetes, fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, age, and blood pressure level. These results in NIDDM patients may be due to contributions from worse blood glucose control at an earlier stage in the patients' diabetes and/or the mitogenic, atherogenic, thrombogenic, and vascular permeability effects of insulin.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34764278", "29871909", "29524484", "29483946"], "label": "0"}

Deciphering which agent to use in certain clinical situations is a new dilemma facing the primary care physician.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo systematically review available data from the literature regarding the efficacy of oral antidiabetic agents, both as monotherapy and in combination.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nA MEDLINE search was performed to identify all English-language reports of unique, randomized controlled clinical trials involving recently available oral agents for type 2 diabetes. Bibliographies were also reviewed to find additional reports not otherwise identified.\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION\nStudies (63) were included in the analysis if they had a study period of at least 3 months; if each group contained at least 10 subjects at the study's conclusion; and if hemoglobin A(1c) was reported. When multiple dosages of a drug were tested, the results of the highest approved dosage were used. In placebo-controlled trials, hemoglobin A(1c) data are presented as the difference between the change in treated vs placebo subjects.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nFive distinct oral drug classes are now available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compared with placebo treatment, most of these agents lower hemoglobin A(1c) levels approximately 1% to 2%. Equivalent efficacy is usually demonstrated when different agents are compared with one another in the same study population. When they are used in combination, there are additional glycemic benefits. Long-term vascular risk reduction has been demonstrated only with sulfonylureas and metformin.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWith few exceptions, the available oral antidiabetic agents are equally effective at lowering glucose concentrations. Their mechanisms of action are different, however, and as a result they appear to have distinct metabolic effects.

Each subject participated in three 23-hour fasting studies after the sequential administration of 1 week of placebo and 1 week of 10 mg and 1 week of 20 mg of the assigned sulfonylurea.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nOccurrence of hypoglycemia (defined as plasma glucose level <3.33 mmol/L [60 mg/dL]) and hormonal parameters during the final 9 hours of the 23-hour fast in patients who had taken sulfonylureas vs placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo hypoglycemia was observed during 156 fasting studies. Plasma glucose level was decreased (nadir, 4.9 mmol/L [88 mg/dL] for a 20-mg dose of glyburide vs 8.3 mmol/L [150 mg/dL] for placebo; nadir, 5.8 mmol/L [105 mg/dL] for a 20-mg dose of glipizide GITS vs 8.7 mmol/L [157 mg/dL] for placebo), and serum insulin was increased in the sulfonylurea studies compared with placebo (P<.001). Plasma glucose parameters did not differ between the 2 sulfonylureas, but C peptide concentrations were increased in the glyburide group compared with glipizide GITS in the 20-mg study (P=.05). Concentrations of epinephrine were increased in the sulfonylurea studies compared with placebo (P<.001). Epinephrine secretion increased when glucose concentration fell below the mean (SD) level of 9.10 (2.66) mmol/L (164 [48] mg/dL) in the 10-mg study and 8.77 (2.83) mmol/L (158 [51] mg/ dL) in the 20-mg study.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFasting was well tolerated among these elderly patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sulfonylureas. Older age should not be considered a contraindication to sulfonylurea treatment for diabetes. Stimulation of epinephrine secretion at normal or elevated plasma glucose levels appears to be the primary mechanism of protection against hypoglycemia in this study.", "outbound_citations": ["9167112", "7589820", "7729308", "8163668", "1600834", "1907291", "1987794", "2677730", "2702912", "2645125", "3285214", "3817306", "4067376", "6380308", "6357904", "6120181", "6995479", "44300", "434200", "6491", "4579520"], "inbound_citations": ["33219502", "32166401", "31367640", "30840917"], "label": "1"}

Serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations have been shown to be powerful predictors of CHD morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. The available data suggest that the target cholesterol concentration in patients with diabetes should be similar to that in non-diabetic individuals with a previous myocardial infarction. This led us to investigate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of a new, highly potent statin, cerivastatin, in diabetic hyperlipidaemia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a multinational, multicentre, double-blind, randomized study in type 2 diabetic patients with hypercholesterolaemia (LDL cholesterol >3.35 mmol/l; triglycerides <4.56 mmol/l). Eligible patients were randomly assigned to groups to receive cerivastatin 0.1 mg or 0.3 mg or placebo in a ratio of 2:2:1 for 12 weeks. They were monitored in the clinic every 4 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 453 patients screened, 265 were allocated to the study groups. Fifty-one received placebo and 107 patients were assigned to each active treatment group (0.1 mg and 0.3 mg cerivastatin). At the close of the study, total cholesterol had decreased by 13.7% and 23.5%, LDL cholesterol decreased by 20.2% and 33.8%, and triglyceride concentrations decreased by 3.9% and 12.3% in the cerivastatin 0.1 mg and 0.3 mg groups, respectively. There was no significant difference between the groups in haemoglobin A1c, adverse events or increases in liver and muscle enzymes during the study period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHypercholesterolaemic patients with type 2 diabetes had a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol concentrations after cerivastatin treatment once daily. The dose of 0.3 mg cerivastatin is effective in diabetic hypercholesterolaemia, with co-reduction of triglyceride concentrations. The effect of cerivastatin on coronary morbidity and mortality is currently being investigated in clinical trials.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Next, we treated another group of 8 patients undergoing regular hemodialysis with nateglinide 90 mg/day for 1-3 months. The effect of hemodialysis on metabolite accumulation was then tested.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter a single 90 mg dose, nateglinide significantly increased the post-prandial secretion of insulin and thereby reduced plasma glucose levels. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC(0-6) 10.45 mg/l/h; t(1/2) 1.89 h, Cl/F 10.19 l/h) were comparable with those reported in healthy subjects. A much larger AUC value than those previously reported of M1, a major metabolite in the urine of healthy subjects, was observed, and the plasma concentration of M1 did not decline up to 6 hours after. In patients treated on a regular basis, there was marked accumulation of M1, while nateglinide could not be detected 24 hours after the last dose. Plasma M1 levels were significantly reduced by the hemodialysis sessions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSingle 90 mg dose of nateglinide was safe and effective in patients with renal failure. However, repeated administrations could cause prolonged hypoglycemia due to accumulation of M1, which is known to have a modest hypoglycemic activity. Hemodialysis may help to eliminate excessive accumulation of M1.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36240884", "35932448", "35144840", "35080257", "34631007", "33168397", "30903688", "29659052"], "label": "0"}

It remains uncertain whether this reflects a primary \u03b2-cell defect in proinsulin processing or is secondary to hyperglycemia. We addressed this question by assessing the effects of reducing hyperglycemia on relative hyperproinsulinemia in subjects with NIDDM. Eight subjects with NIDDM underwent three 8-week periods in a randomized crossover design of therapy with diet alone, sulfonylurea (gliclazide), or insulin (ultralente). The effects on \u03b2-cell peptide concentrations were assessed 1) fasting, 2) in response to hyperglycemie clamping, and 3) in response to an injection of the nonglucose secreto-gogue arginine and compared with measurements in seven nondiabetic control subjects. Both sulfonylurea and insulin therapy substantially reduced fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations, compared with diet therapy alone. The diabetic subjects on diet therapy had relative hyperproinsulinemia, assessed relative to C-peptide concentrations, fasting and in response to hyperglycemie clamping and arginine, compared with control subjects. Neither sulfonylurea nor insulin therapy altered the relative hyperproinsulinemia. Insulin therapy reduced fasting proinsulin concentrations from geometric mean 29.4 (1 SD range, 14.6-59.0) pmol/l on diet therapy to 18.7 (7.3-48.1) pmol/l (P < 0.05). A similar trend was evident with fasting C-peptide concentrations with a reduction from 0.9 (0.6-1.4) nmol/l on diet therapy to 0.6 (0.4-0.9) nmol/l (P = 0.06), so that the relative hyperproinsulinemia, assessed as the ratio of fasting proinsulin to C-peptide, was unchanged by insulin. Similarly, insulin therapy failed to reduce the ratio of proinsulin to C-peptide concentrations in response to a hyperglycemie clamp and in the acute incremental response to arginine. Failure to improve the relative hyperproinsulinemia of NIDDM, despite significant reduction of hyperglycemia with exogenous insulin therapy, supports the hypothesis that relative hyperproinsulinemia in NIDDM is a reflection of a primary \u03b2-cell defect rather than being secondary to hyperglycemia.", "outbound_citations": ["8784086", "7859937", "7955969", "8013750", "8033529", "8138054", "8181257", "8403400", "8513975", "8508612", "8472350", "8420813", "1516482", "1516496", "1860012", "2200619", "2186054", "2695369", "2792577", "2563455", "2649327", "2644145", "3059740", "3289992", "6373814", "343587", "323542", "1133173", "4795985", "4672850"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

NIDDM volunteers (192) with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 140\u2013250 mg/dl and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 6.5\u201312.0% after at least 4 weeks of treatment with SFU at maximal dose were stratified by baseline HbA1c (above and below 9.0%) and then randomly assigned within strata to placebo (n = 63), 50 mg miglitol 3 times a day (n = 61), or 100 mg miglitol 3 times a day (n = 68). Efficacy was assessed by HbA1c, FPG, insulin, and lipid concentrations, and by plasma glucose and serum insulin responses to a standard meal. RESULTS In the 50 and 100 mg miglitol treatment groups, the mean changes from baseline in HbA1c (with placebo values subtracted) were 0.82 and 0.74%, respectively, and were highly significant (P = 0.0001 in each case). Mean peak plasma glucose levels after a standard test meal were comparably lowered by 57 mg/dl with the 50 mg miglitol dose, and by 64 mg/dl with the 100 mg miglitol dose compared with placebo (P = 0.0001 for each), with associated reductions in integrated serum insulin response (P < 0.05). No significant drug-associated changes in FPG, insulin, or cholesterol levels were noted, but fasting triglyceride levels were lowered significantly with the 50 mg miglitol dose. Miglitol's side effects were limited to flatulence, loose stools, and abdominal discomfort, which were dose-related, rapidly resolved on drug discontinuation, and led to withdrawal from the study of 5 and 15% of patients taking 50 and 100 mg miglitol, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Miglitol may be indicated as effective adjuvant therapy in NIDDM patients with suboptimal metabolic control despite conventional treatment with diet and maximal daily doses of SFU. The dose of 50 mg miglitol 3 times a day may be preferable to 100 mg miglitol 3 times a day because of comparable efficacy and substantially reduced side effects.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31333110", "30934879", "29534502"], "label": "0"}

Of the 13 subjects, 9 were randomized to the glipizide GITS arm and 4 were randomized to the placebo arm of the study. Serum glucose, insulin, C-peptide, plasma glucagon, and plasma amylin concentrations were measured under fasting and postprandial (post-Sustacal ingestion) conditions. The Sustacal challenge was performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with either glipizide GITS or placebo. RESULTS Glipizide GITS treatment resulted in a significant reduction in hyperglycemia and increases in insulin and C-peptide secretion. Hyperglucagonemia was not ameliorated, and amylin secretion was not altered after glipizide GITS treatment. Placebo-treated patients did not show significant changes in any of the parameters measured. CONCLUSIONS Glipizide GITS treatment failed to ameliorate the hyperglucagonemia of NIDDM and did not alter amylin secretion even though it increased insulin secretion and significantly ameliorated the hyperglycemia.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n = 54) who were \u2265 20% over ideal body weight participated in a 20-week behavioral weight control program. Subjects were randomized to either a standard behavioral therapy (SBT) group or to one of two VLCD groups. SBT subjects received a 1,500\u22121,800 kcal/day diet throughout. Both VLCD groups followed a VLCD for 5 consecutive days during week 2, followed by either intermittent VLCD therapy for 1 day/week for 15 weeks (1-day) or for 5 consecutive days every 5 weeks (5-day), with a 1,500\u22121,800 kcal/day diet at other times. RESULTS Both VLCD groups lost more weight than the SBT group over the 20 weeks (P = 0.04). Although the groups did not differ in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) changes at 20 weeks, more subjects in the 5-day group attained a normal HbA1c when compared with the SBT group (P = 0.04). This benefit was independent of the effects of weight loss. The best predictor of overall change in FPG and HbA1c was the FPG response during the first 3 weeks of the program. CONCLUSIONS Periodic VLCDs improved weight loss in diabetic subjects. A regimen with intermittent 5-day VLCD therapy seemed particularly promising, because more subjects in this group attained a normal HbA1c.

Due to frequent occurrence of lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with serious contraindications to biguanide therapy and in cases of non-compliance with dosage instructions, buformin and phenformin were taken off the market in most European countries at the end of the seventies. Metformin continued to be allowed, since the risk of lactic acidosis is 20 times less than with phenformin or buformin due to the different pharmacokinetic properties of the substance. Plenty of clinical experience has been gained with metformin, documented in a large number of reliable long-term studies.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nMetformin lowers fasting blood glucose levels by an average of 25% (17 to 37%), postprandial blood glucose by up to 44.5% and HbA1c bei 1.5% (0.8 to 3.1%) Metformin reduces raised plasma insulin levels in cases of metabolic syndrome by as much as 30% and reduces the \"insulin requirement\" of type 2 insulin-treated diabetics by 15 to 32%. It has well documented effects on various rheological parameters. In overweight type 2 diabetics, metformin shows the same level of hypoglycaemic effect as all of the important sulfonylurea derivatives used in Europe. The active mechanism of these derivatives is, however, concentrated solely on reduction of blood glucose. This mechanism does not take into account the remaining risk constellation involved in insulin resistance. Biguanides, similarly to weight reduction, lead to a reduction of hyperinsulinaemia, which is by contrast exacerbated by sulfonylureas and, in particular, exogenous insulin.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe risk of lactic acidosis can probably be eliminated entirely if dosage instructions and contraindications are observed carefully. The cause of such neglect in 83% of all cases was limited on renal function (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg%). Regarding morbidity and mortality from lactic acidosis, metformin therapy is no riskier than treatment with the sulfonylurea derivative glibenclamide, taking into account the incidence of fatal hypoglycaemias with the latter.", "outbound_citations": ["1936483", "344119", "1778353", "2404714", "1936478", "8529486", "193525", "8013758", "3310318", "2862087", "7912625", "3552515", "6229255", "1936477", "8462390", "7821128", "3935560", "1936479", "1752350", "1713132", "1936481", "1600835", "6352352", "6818080", "406158", "3533670", "8112499", "1936474", "2975549", "589351", "3051084", "2534084", "387488", "2158410", "3817257", "1886346", "1936475", "5027232", "8075887", "7833731", "1834486", "3302085", "1936471", "6360756", "5440868", "2142054", "4630579", "8453955", "6403102", "3865878", "3745404", "6430443", "6350078", "1955512", "6847752", "4169605", "6350337", "2956047", "631459"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

It is estimated that 10% of Mexican Americans >or=20 years of age have diabetes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glimepiride, a long-acting sulfonylurea, as an adjunct to diet/exercise in Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Mexican Americans with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, defined as a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level between 120 mg/dL and 225 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) values between 8.0% and 10.5%, after >or=3 months of diet/exercise were enrolled. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (using the lowest available treatment assignment number when eligibility was established) to receive 14 weeks of glimepiride or matching placebo once daily with continued diet/exercise. The starting glimepiride dose was 1 mg, with titration to 2 mg and 4 mg for FPG levels >120 mg/dL. The primary efficacy variable was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to study end point. Secondary efficacy variables were HbA(1c) response (rated as excellent, good, or marginal) and changes in FPG, fasting insulin, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels from baseline to study end point. The tolerability of glimepiride in this study population was determined by evaluating adverse events, hypoglycemic episodes, and physical examination as well as laboratory findings. All analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis. A per-protocol analysis also was conducted to support the primary efficacy analysis. Seventy patients were randomized to treatment with glimepiride (n = 48) or placebo ((n = 22). The glimepiride and placebo groups were similar with respect to mean (SE) age (48.4 [11.7] and 50.7 [10.0] years, respectively) and sex (56.3% [27/48] and 50.0% [11/22] were male, respectively). However, the glimepiride group had a higher mean body weight (83.3 [17.0] vs 76.3 [18.5] kg) and a significantly higher mean fasting insulin level (23.8 [17.7] vs 17.8 [19.7] microU/mL; P = 0.031). The mean (SE) HbA(1c) values at study end point were 7.8% (0.2%) and 9.9% (0.7%) in patients receiving glimepiride and placebo, respectively. The adjusted mean difference in HbA(1c) reduction from baseline to end point was statistically significant in favor of glimepiride (-1.8% [0.4%]; P < 0.001). More pronounced HbA(1c) impairment at baseline was associated with greater glimepiride-placebo differences in HbA(1c) reduction. Glimepiride-treated patients also achieved a significantly greater improvement in FPG, with an adjusted mean (SE) treatment difference of -46.7 (16.7) mg/dL (P = 0.007). Glimepiride did not appear to affect fibrinogen and PAI-1 levels but was associated with significantly greater mean increases in fasting insulin (10.2 vs -2.1 microU/mL; P = 0.002) and body weight (2.3 vs 2.1 kg; P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Glimepiride was well tolerated, with an adverse-event profile similar to that of placebo. These results indicate that once-daily glimepiride plus diet/exercise was effective in Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes whose disease was inadequately controlled with diet/exercise alone. It appeared to be well tolerated in the population studied. More weight gain was seen with glimepiride compared with placebo. Given the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Mexican Americans, further clinical studies of glimepiride and other glucose-lowering therapies are needed in this ethnic subset.", "outbound_citations": ["10869319", "10892828", "10399896", "10191799", "10369424", "9793597", "9742977", "10710815", "9702425", "9702849", "9653594", "9399608", "9184703", "8908379", "8911976", "8911977", "8742562", "8911987", "8722048", "7634558", "7587918", "8529507", "8529506", "2102668", "2776587", "2644769", "3180635", "3384186", "3940446", "3804566"], "inbound_citations": ["36498669", "34803446"], "label": "1"}

However, in vivo results have been disputed because the amelioration of insulin action that follows sulfonylurea may represent the relief from glucose toxicity rather than a direct effect of the drug. Therefore, we studied the hypoglycemic action of gliclazide acutely and after 2 months of therapy in seven type 2 diabetic patients. All patients received a 240-minute i.v. glucose infusion with [3-3H]glucose. In a random order, 160 mg gliclazide (study 1) or placebo (study 2) was given orally before glucose infusion. Finally, the effect of 160 mg gliclazide was reassessed after a two-month treatment with the same sulfonylurea (80 mg t.i.d.). Basal plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and endogenous glucose production (EGP) were similar before the two initial studies. During glucose infusion, EGP was more suppressed after gliclazide in spite of comparable increase in plasma insulin and C-peptide. After the two-month therapy, basal plasma glucose levels and HbA1c were lower while plasma insulin and C-peptide were higher with respect to baseline (p < 0.05). Gliclazide further reduced plasma glucose, the incremental area above baseline, and EGP during glucose infusion, while plasma insulin and C-peptide achieved higher plateaus (p < 0.05). When data were pooled, plasma glucose concentration and EGP correlated both in the basal state (r = 0.71) and during the last hour of glucose infusion (r = 0.84; both p < 0.05). These data suggest that gliclazide enhances the suppression of EGP induced by insulin and that this effect is greater with chronic treatment because of concomitant improvement of insulin secretion.", "outbound_citations": ["8843172", "7829624", "1600834", "1872301", "1794262", "2192847", "2677730", "3289989", "3275860", "3297886", "3552528", "3100365", "3882491", "6376033", "6432610", "5421186"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG), and HbA1c were measured at predetermined intervals during the washout period and the 14-week study. Adverse events were tabulated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt each patient visit, reduction from baseline FPG was greater in each glimepiride group than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Changes from baseline to endpoint after 1, 4, and 8 mg glimepiride exceeded those after placebo (P < 0.001) by 2.4, 3.9, and 4.1 mmol/l, respectively, for FPG; by 1.2, 1.8, and 1.9 percentage points, respectively, for HbA1c; and by 3.5, 5.1, and 5.2 mmol/l, respectively, for 2-h PPG. Greater reductions in these parameters were observed with 8 and 4 mg than with 1 mg (P < 0.05), indicating a dose-response relationship. When patients with baseline HbA1c levels > or = 8% were assessed, more patients who received 8 mg glimepiride had HbA1c values < 8% at endpoint compared with patients receiving 4 mg. Glimepiride had a favorable safety profile.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGlimepiride in 1-, 4-, or 8-mg doses was effective and well tolerated. Although the 4- and 8-mg once-daily doses were significantly more potent than the 1-mg dose, all three doses yielded clinical improvement. Because the 8-mg dose controlled HbA1c values in a greater number of patients with high baseline HbA1c levels than did the 4-mg dose, this higher dose might be beneficial for patients who are difficult to treat.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33479584", "32026779", "30760125", "29282633"], "label": "1"}

After glibenclamide, area under the glucose infusion curves and maximal incremental serum insulin responses were higher by 25-40% and by 30% compared to AG when low, medium and high doses of each drug were tested. However, a linear dose relationship was obtained for both drugs when the glucose infusion rate was plotted against the area under the insulin curve. In fact, both drugs were equipotent on a molecular weight basis. The hypoglycaemic index of both drugs (integrated glucose infusion rate divided by integrated insulin release) expressed per mumol of drug revealed a dose-dependent and parallel inverse curvilinear relation to increasing doses.

In this article, the authors compare the effectiveness of dosing glyburide at bedtime versus in the morning on glycemic control in patients with NIDDM under suboptimal control. In a placebocontrolled, double\u2010blind crossover trial, 32 patients with NIDDM with suboptimal control on chronic glyburide treatment fulfilling entry criteria were randomized to receive one of two regimens: (1) glyburide at bedtime and placebo in the morning or (2) placebo at bedtime and glyburide in the morning. After 6 months of a regimen, patients crossed over to the other treatment and completed an additional 6\u2010month period. After baseline assessment, fasting blood sugar, history, physical exam, and compliance assessments were performed monthly. HbA1c was measured bimonthly and Sustacal\u00ae tolerance tests were performed at the end of each 6\u2010month treatment period. During the initial 6\u2010month comparison fasting, blood sugar concentration decreased 5% in bedtime ingesters and rose 10% in the morning patients. These changes were not statistically significant. HbA1c decreased significantly in the morning group but remained unchanged in the bedtime group. At the end of 12 months, nighttime dosing resulted in better home glucose monitoring values, fasting blood sugar results, and Sustacal\u00ae tolerance profiles, but the differences were not statistically significant. No hypoglycemia was observed in the monitored data collected. Bedtime dosing of glyburide resulted in measurable improvement in fasting blood sugar and carbohydrate tolerance curves, but not to a degree justifying general recommendation of this technique in patients with NIDDM with secondary failure to oral agents.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

To expand on this finding, we investigated at the clinical level how long-term administration of troglitazone influences the body fat distribution in type 2 diabetic patients.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nTroglitazone (400 mg/day) was administered for 6 months to 30 type 2 diabetic patients whose glycemic control was poor. A total of 18 patients received diet therapy alone (in the single-treatment group, BMI 26.0 +/- 4.6, HbA1c 8.2 +/- 1.7%), and 12 patients concomitantly received glibenclamide (1.25-7.5 mg/day) (in the concomitant sulfonylurea group, BMI 25.4 +/- 4.7, HbA1c 9.2 +/- 1.2%). BMI, HbA1c, serum lipid level, and body fat distribution, which were determined by computed tomography (CT) scan at the umbilical level, were measured and compared before and after troglitazone treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the 6-month troglitazone treatment, HbA1c levels decreased and BMI increased in both groups. As for body fat distribution in the single-treatment group, visceral fat area (VFA) decreased (from 118.3 +/- 54.3 to 101.1 +/- 50.8 cm2; P < 0.001), and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) increased (from 189.7 +/- 93.3 to 221.6 +/- 101.6 cm2; P < 0.001), resulting in a decrease in visceral/subcutaneous (V/S) ratio (from 0.74 +/- 0.48 to 0.50 +/- 0.32; P < 0.001). In the concomitant sulfonylurea group, VFA was unchanged (from 108.1 +/- 53.5 to 112.5 +/- 59.9 cm2), while SFA increased (from 144.6 +/- 122.0 to 180.5 +/- 143.5 cm2; P < 0.01), thereby decreasing the V/S ratio (from 0.91 +/- 0.46 to 0.77 +/- 0.44; P < 0.01). The serum triglyceride level and the area under glucose curve during the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test decreased significantly in the single-treatment group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAccording to our data, troglitazone appears to promote fat accumulation in the subcutaneous adipose tissue rather than in the visceral adipose tissue in mildly obese Japanese people with type 2 diabetes. This shift of energy accumulation from the visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue may greatly contribute to the troglitazone-mediated amelioration of insulin resistance.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36009398", "34553185", "33926085", "31760227", "31003924", "28867301"], "label": "0"}

METHODS Questionnaires distributed by physicians yielded baseline responses from 3696 patients who were beginning repaglinide treatment. Data were analyzed from 1233 respondents who also completed follow-up questionnaires after 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS Among respondents, 60% were taking repaglinide with other antidiabetic agents in combination therapy; 59% were taking metformin, and 24% were taking troglitazone. Most respondents (84%) indicated that they were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with repaglinide therapy, 92% wished to continue its use, and 60% believed that the treatment had improved their attitude toward taking antidiabetic medication. Patients perceived that fasting blood glucose levels were reduced during treatment, as was the incidence of hyperglycemia. Corresponding changes in perceived frequency of hypoglycemia during repaglinide treatment were minimal. CONCLUSIONS Patient perceptions of prandial oral therapy with repaglinide were predominantly positive, due mostly to the perception that glucose control was achieved, with minimal perception of any increase in hypoglycemic episodes.", "outbound_citations": ["10977012", "10466662", "10332683", "10332668", "9545118"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

Insulin may subsequently be required for optimal control in spite of peripheral hyperinsulinemia. In Mexico, diabetes associated with obesity is common. We therefore designed a prospective study combining insulin and chloropropamide in order to evaluate any improvement in insulin response to a standardized meal load and a consequent amelioration of glucose control. METHODS. Twenty diabetic patients with secondary failure to full doses of hypoglycemic drugs and moderate hyperglycemia were recruited. Therapy was initiated with human insulin 20 IU/day and 500 mg cholopropamide, titrating insulin dosage in order to achieve euglycemia. Before treatment and at the end of the study period, a glucose/insulin/C peptide response curve to a mixed standardized meal was performed. Blood glucose, serum lipids fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were also determined. All patients were followed by capillary glucose measurements three times a week and glucose and fructosamine concentrations every two weeks during the study period. RESULTS. All patients required less insulin, and glucose control improved significantly. Glucose, fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin levels decreased from 262 mg/dL, 369 mmol/L and 14% to 111 mg/dL, 252 mmol/L, and 8% respectively; all differences were statistically significant. Insulin and C peptide levels increased significantly from 22.2 mU/mL and 1.65 ng/mL to 29.8 mU/mL and 1.97 ng/mL, respectively. When we measured the area under the curve, total values improved from 110 and 7.69 to 127 and 9.37, respectively; this was also statistically significant. Lipids levels decreased significantly, including triglicerides, total and LDL cholesterol whereas HDL cholesterol levels increased. CONCLUSIONS. Glucose control improved in our patient cohort the pancreatic insulin response probably due to a more adequate glycemic microenvironment and a possible enhanced exogenous and endogenous insulin function.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Of the poorly controlled female NIDDM patients on sulfonylurea treatment, 18 were randomly selected from the outpatient diabetic clinic for study. For 8 weeks, they received either acarbose (300 mg/daily) or metformin (1,500 mg/daily) in addition to sulfonylurea in a crossover design using a 3-week washout period between treatments. The efficacy of each drug regimen was assessed by measuring the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting and 2-h postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) levels, cholesterol, triglyceride, and fibrinogen levels before and after 8 weeks of therapy. RESULTS The metabolic parameters measured before initiation of either treatment regimen were similar. Mean fasting and 2-h postprandial glucose levels were reduced moderately at the end of 8 weeks of both combination treatments (P < 0.05). Although the fasting and 2-h postprandial plasma insulin and C-peptide and fibrinogen levels at the end of the 8-week treatment periods were lower than those obtained at the beginning of the study, the differences between these values were not statistically significant. Cholesterol levels remained unchanged. Only the 2-h PPBG level in the group using acarbose plus a sulfonylurea was lower than the level achieved by the group using metformin plus a sulfonylurea (8.1 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 9.8 \u00b1 1.0 mmol/l, respectively, P < 0.05). The difference between pre- and posttreatment levels of the 2-h PPBG level in both arms of the study were statistically significant (\u0394-acarbose, 5.3 \u00b1 0.4 vs. ff-metformin, 2.9 \u00b1 0.3) (P < 0.05).

The present model analysis was undertaken to investigate the clinical and economic impact of bodyweight gain in patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and its effects on the development of CHD. Based on a retrospective re-evaluation of data from the Diabetes Intervention Study (DIS), patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stable bodyweight (group A) had a significantly lower rate of combined CHD events (30.3%) than patients showing a bodyweight gain (group B; 38.2%) over 10 years. Prevention of bodyweight gain, therefore, appears to be a meaningful strategy in the management of diabetes mellitus. In addition to this clinical advantage, prevention of CHD will also result in economic savings associated with avoided treatment of coronary events. Based on the clinical outcomes from the DIS, the calculated per-patient net savings for a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stable bodyweight amounted to 1085 deutschmarks (DM) when compared with a patient experiencing a bodyweight increase. In a further step, the above situation was projected to current type 2 diabetes mellitus practice. Oral first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is usually initiated with glibenclamide (glyburide), which is known to increase bodyweight (reflecting group B). The novel alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose, in contrast, appears to be as effective as glibenclamide, but has the advantage of being bodyweight-neutral (reflecting group A). From the clinical viewpoint, acarbose can thus be considered an alternative to glibenclamide. From the viewpoint of drug costs, monotherapy with acarbose is 4 times as expensive as glibenclamide in Germany, resulting in per-patient incremental costs of DM3527 for acarbose over 10 years. Balanced against the potential 10-year cost saving of DM1085 resulting from the potential of acarbose to prevent CHD, around one-third of the incremental cost of acarbose may be recouped by this single effect. However, further possible benefits of acarbose, including the avoidance of hypoglycaemia and the deferral of costly insulin therapy, may improve the economic value of this novel antidiabetic agent. Given the indirect approach of this evaluation and its many limitations, the above findings need critical appraisal, and comparative trials are urgently required to substantiate our preliminary results.", "outbound_citations": ["2253830", "6411511", "2253831", "10997648", "8913408", "8888075", "8549020", "7833731", "7966112", "8324779", "1307526", "1823561", "1954810", "2060433", "2314422", "2509743", "2527134", "2702912", "2882231", "3935560", "4830839", "4359625", "4626706", "13766421", "3961464", "2677730", "7734015", "1353565"], "inbound_citations": ["35723349", "12751913", "15061682"], "label": "0"}

Nateglinide is an oral hypoglycemic agent approved for use alone or in combination with metformin as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nateglinide, an amino acid derivative of D-phenylalanine, stimulates the secretion of insulin by binding to the ATP potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells. The result is an increase in beta-cell calcium influx, which leads to rapid, short-lived insulin release. The drug is rapidly and completely absorbed in the small intestine. The estimated bioavailability is 72%. Nateglinide is highly bound to plasma proteins, is metabolized extensively by the liver, and has an elimination half-life of 1.4 hours. Several clinical trials of nateglinide, alone and in combination with other oral hypoglycemic agents, have found the drug to be safe, effective, and well tolerated. The most common adverse effects are nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and lightheadedness. There is a potential for interactions between nateglinide and medications affected by the cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme system. Dosage regimens ranging from 60 to 240 mg have been evaluated. The maximum effective dosage is 120 mg taken 10 minutes before meals three times a day. Nateglinide is an alternative to second-generation sulfonylureas for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additional comparative trials are needed to fully elucidate nateglinide's role.", "outbound_citations": ["10868314", "10773014", "10868864", "10720043", "10868832", "9543688", "9145209", "9117089", "8931947", "8894500", "8687494", "8596487", "8745339", "7864093", "8119179", "8177906", "10868314", "10773014", "10868864", "10720043", "10868832", "9543688", "9145209", "9117089", "8931947", "8894500", "8687494", "8596487", "8745339", "7864093", "8119179", "8177906"], "inbound_citations": ["35740156", "33866315", "30923035", "35740156", "33866315", "30923035"], "label": "1"}

Thirty-eight diabetic patients, 15 male and 23 female, aged 20-70 yr, 33 noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients, and 5 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients, were recruited in this study. Fasting and 1-h postprandial blood glucose (BG) profiles were undertaken from three groups of patients with diabetes before and after short-term of treatment of lithium carbonate. Group I was treated with diet only, Group II with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA), and Group III with insulin.

We sought to determine whether metabolic control, independent of its oral mode of implementation, affects PAI-1 in patients with marked hyperglycemia.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA total of 91 subjects were screened, subjected to a 4-week drug washout, and randomized to daily treatment with glipizide GITS (maximum 20 mg, n = 46) or metformin (maximum 2,550 mg, n = 45) as monotherapy. After monotherapy, combination therapy was initiated by adding the second agent to the regimen. Plasma glucose (fasting and postprandial), HbA(1c), fructosamine, and PAI-1 were assayed before and after randomization and sequentially thereafter in all subjects; hepatic glucose output (HGO) and abdominal fat distribution were each measured in a subset of subjects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGlycemic control was markedly impaired at baseline (mean HbA(1c) 10.4 +/- 0.2% glipizide GITS; 10.0 +/- 0.2% metformin) but improved comparably with each agent as monotherapy and in combination (P < 0.0001 vs. baseline), as assessed with meal tolerance studies, fructosamine values, and HGO. Body weight and abdominal fat distribution did not change significantly in either group. PAI-1 concentrations were extraordinarily high (5- to 10-fold more than normal) at baseline (202 +/- 12 ng/ml glipizide GITS; 201 +/- 13 ng/ml metformin) but declined comparably, and significantly, after treatment with either agent as monotherapy and decreased further with combination therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhen hyperglycemia is profound, increases in PAI-1 are also profound.

A randomised, double-blind study has been carried out to attempt to answer the question of whether intermittent sulphonylurea therapy is more effective then continuous administration. Responders to oral glibenclamide (glyburide) went on to receive continuous or intermittent treatment (glibenclamide for 2 weeks then placebo for 2 weeks) for 16 weeks. Glycaemic control was maintained in the continuous treatment group. However, glucose levels deteriorated in the intermittent treatment group, suggesting that there is no merit to intermittent sulphonylurea treatment.

The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are linear over the clinical dosage range of 200 to 600 mg once daily. The mean elimination half-life ranges from 7.6 to 24 hours, which facilitates a once daily administration regimen. The pharmacokinetics of troglitazone are similar between patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy individuals. In humans, troglitazone undergoes metabolism by sulfation, glucuronidation and oxidation to form a sulfate conjugate (M1), glucuronide conjugate (M2) and quinone metabolite (M3), respectively. M1 and M3 are the major metabolites in plasma, and M2 is a minor metabolite. Age, gender, type 2 diabetes, renal impairment, smoking and race do not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of troglitazone and its 2 major metabolites. In patients with hepatic impairment the plasma concentrations of troglitazone, M1 and M3 increase by 30%, 4-fold, and 2-fold, respectively.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this three-center double-blind study, 90 Chinese NIDDM patients with persistent poor glycemic control despite maximal doses of sulfonylurea and metformin were randomly assigned to receive additional treatment with acarbose 100 mg thrice daily or placebo for 24 weeks, after 6 weeks of dietary reinforcement. Efficacy was assessed by changes in HbA1c, fasting and 1-h postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels, and fasting lipid levels. RESULTS Acarbose treatment was associated with significantly greater reductions in HbA1c (\u22120.5 \u00b1 0.2% vs. placebo 0.1 \u00b1 0.2% [means \u00b1 SEM], P = 0.038), 1-h postprandial glucose (\u22122.3 \u00b1 0.4 mmol/1 vs. placebo 0.7 \u00b1 0.4 mmol/1, P < 0.001) and body weight (\u22120.54 \u00b1 0.32 kg vs. placebo 0.42 \u00b1 0.29 kg, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding changes in fasting plasma glucose and lipids or fasting and postprandial insulin levels. Flatulence was the most common side effect (acarbose vs. placebo: 28/45 vs. 11/44, P < 0.05). One patient on acarbose had asymptomatic elevations in serum transaminases that normalized in 4 weeks after acarbose withdrawal. Another patient on acarbose developed severe hypoglycemia; glycemic control was subsequently maintained on half the baseline dosage of sulfonylurea. CONCLUSIONS In NIDDM patients inadequately controlled on conventional oral agents, acarbose in moderate doses resulted in beneficial effects on glycemic control, especially postprandial glycemia, and mean body weight. Additional use of acarbose can be considered as a useful alternative in such patients if they are reluctant to accept insulin therapy.", "outbound_citations": ["9051366", "9083705", "8742572", "7555508", "7733122", "7734015", "8082525", "28634739", "8432223", "1954810", "2276309", "2209341", "6624769"], "inbound_citations": ["35707855", "33190640", "32946450", "32582019", "32879252", "30604599", "28685995", "30263707"], "label": "0"}

We have examined the impact of race and positive family history of type 2 diabetes on glucose/insulin dynamics and the two components of glucose disposal in healthy, first\u2010degree relatives of black and white American patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are at a greater risk from the disease and their healthy control subjects. Seventeen black and 15 white relatives were studied. Twenty\u2010two black people and 24 white people, without family history of type 2 diabetes, served as healthy control subjects. Standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and tolbutamide\u2010modified frequent sampling intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIGT) tests were performed in each subject. Insulin sensitivity index (SI) and glucose effectiveness (SG) were calculated using the MINI\u2010MOD method described by Bergman et al. Mean fasting and post\u2010stimulation serum glucose levels were not significantly different in the black and white relatives. However, mean serum insulin responses to oral and/or intravenous stimulation were significantly greater in the blacks than whites, irrespective of positive family history of diabetes. The mean SI was significantly (P < 0\u00b702) lower (52%) in the black (3\u00b767\u00b10\u00b756) than the white [7\u00b750\u00b11\u00b793 times 10\u20104 min\u20101 (mUl)\u20101] relatives.

Mean SG and KG were greater (P < \u00b705) in the blacks than whites, irrespective of family history of diabetes. In summary, the present study demonstrates that non\u2010diabetic black people manifest insulin resistant and hyperinsulinaemia, irrespective of family history of diabetes, when compared to white people.

Its mechanism of action, unknown until a few years ago, is now linked to an improved peripheral sensitivity to insulin, through a stimulated tissue glucose uptake by a transporter linked system. Interest in metformin has been revived by the recent observation of a specific activity of this agent on some of the major traits of the so called 'polymetabolic syndrome' (or 'syndrome X'), characterized by: insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension and reduced fibrinolytic activity. Metformin, in studies examining one or more of these, has been shown, possibly through its peripheral insulin sensitizing mechanism, to correct most of the major symptoms characterizing this insulin resistance syndrome. Metformin, similarly to the other biguanide phenformin, has been rated as potentially dangerous, because of the possible induction of lactic acidosis, in some cases with a fatal outcome. Metformin is, however, associated with a very low incidence of lactic acidosis because, differently from phenformin, it does not undergo liver metabolism and, as a consequence, there are no high-risk groups, displaying an impaired metabolic handling. In this review, in addition to an overall evaluation of the more recent data on the mechanism of action and clinical use of metformin, a detailed clinical analysis of all published cases of lactic acidosis is provided. These data indicate that the risk in metformin use is negligible, provided that care is taken when prescribing the drug to patients with suspected clinical risks of lactic acidosis.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36523728", "35431313", "36237922", "34781617", "36994340", "33826656", "32652456", "32699722", "32631779", "31911295", "31735071", "31449807", "31338110", "30918838", "30517046", "30191997", "30521580", "30581638", "28422298", "30103263", "29225865"], "label": "0"}

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS There were 284 NIDDM patients (20\u201382 years of age) whose glycemic control while on a diet was judged stable but was judged unsatisfactory (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] \u2265 8.3 mmol/l) when entered into a multicenter and double-blind study with parallel groups study. They were randomly allocated into two groups, the troglitazone group (the T group: 400 mg/day p.o.) and the placebo group (the P group), and were treated with test drugs for 12 weeks. RESULTS We evaluated efficacy in 136 patients of the T group and 126 patients of the P group. There was no significant difference in any of baseline characteristics between the T and P groups. In the T group, FPG and HbA1c decreased significantly after treatment (before versus after, FPG 10.1 \u00b1 1.6 vs. 8.8 \u00b1 1.9 mmol/l, P < 0.001; HbA1c: 8.6 \u00b1 1.5 vs 8.1 \u00b1 1.7%, P < 0.001). FPG and HbA1c did not change after treatment in the P group (before versus after, FPG 10.1 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 9.9 \u00b1 2.1 mmol/l; HbA1c 8.5 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 8.6 \u00b1 1.6%). Of 136 patients in the T group, 62 (45.6%) were classified as responders. Serum triglyceride level also decreased in the T group but not in the P group. Body weight increased slightly only in the T group. There were no differences in changes in blood pressure between the two groups. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS Troglitazone at 400 mg/day decreased FPG and HbA1c significantly in NIDDM patients who had failed to respond to diet therapy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This double-blind placebo-controlled trial was performed in 29 patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia. After stable glycemie control was achieved by diet and/or oral Hypoglycemic drugs, patients were instructed to follow a cholesterol-lowering diet for 6 weeks. Patients who met entry criteria received, under double-blind conditions, policosanol (5 mg) or placebo tablets twice a day for 12 weeks. RESULTS Policosanol (10 mg/day) significantly reduced total cholesterol by 17.5% and LDL cholesterol by 21.8% compared with baseline and placebo. Furthermore, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was raised by 11.3% (not significant), and triglycerides showed a statistically nonsignificant decrease of 6.6%. These changes in lipid profile were similar to those induced by policosanol in nondiabetic patients with type II hyperlipoproteinemia. CONCLUSIONS Glycemie control was unaffected by treatment.

We assessed mortality associated with the ADA fasting-glucose criteria compared with the WHO 2 h post-challenge glucose criteria.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe assessed baseline data on glucose concentrations at fasting and 2 h after the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test from 13 prospective European cohort studies, which included 18,048 men and 7316 women aged 30 years or older. Mean follow-up was 7.3 years. We assessed the risk of death according to the different diagnostic glucose categories.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nCompared with men who had normal fasting glucose (< 6.1 mmol/L), men with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus by the ADA fasting criteria (> or = 7.0 mmol/L) had a hazard ratio for death of 1.81 (95% CI 1.49-2.20); for women the hazard ratio was 1.79 (1.18-2.69). For impaired fasting glucose (6.1-6.9 mmol/L), the hazard ratios were 1.21 (1.05-1.41) and 1.08 (0.70-1.66). For the WHO criteria (> or = 11.1 mmol/L), the ratios for newly diagnosed diabetes were 2.02 (1.66-2.46) in men and 2.77 (1.96-3.92) in women, and for impaired glucose tolerance (7.8-11.1 mmol/L) were 1.51 (1.32-1.72) and 1.60 (1.22-2.10). Within each fasting-glucose classification, mortality increased with increasing 2 h glucose. However, for 2 h glucose classifications of impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes, there was no trend for increasing fasting glucose concentrations.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nFasting-glucose concentrations alone do not identify individuals at increased risk of death associated with hyperglycaemia.

METHODS Thirty persons with type 2 diabetes, over age 70, were recruited from the St Louis University geriatric clinics. Participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Group A broke 30 Glynase Prestabs and 30 generic tablets using 2 different manual tablet-breaking methods. Group B broke 15 Glynase Prestabs and 15 generic tablets without instructions. Visual analog scales were used to assess pain and difficulty of tablet breaking. RESULTS A higher percentage of successful tablet breaking was reported with Glynase Prestabs (80%) compared with the generic tablets (33%). Mean pain scores for breaking Glynase Prestabs were 0.1 (Group A) and 0.9 (Group B). Higher pain scores were obtained for the generic tablets (2.1 for Group A, 3.2 for Group B). Glynase Prestabs were easier to break in both groups, and the resultant half tablets showed less variance from the expected theoretical weight (50% of whole parent tablet weight).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 15-week study involved 161 subjects with NIDDM. Subjects were randomized into two groups. For 4 weeks, group 1 received glimepiride 3 mg twice daily, and group 2 received glimepiride 6 mg once daily. After a 3-week placebo-washout period, twice- and once-daily regimens were crossed over for a second 4-week treatment period. Subjects were hospitalized at the end of each placebo or active-treatment phase. Their glucose concentrations were recorded at 20 time points over a 24-hour period, and their insulin and C-peptide concentrations were recorded at 16 time points over the same period. Parameters that were calculated included fasting, 24-hour, and postprandial concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide. RESULTS: One hundred six patients were randomized to receive treatment; 94 completed the entire study. Existing physiologic mechanisms of glucose control were apparently unimpaired by glimepiride treatment. Insulin concentrations increased more during the postprandial glucose peaks than when subjects were fasting. Both twice- and once-daily regimens proved equally effective in reducing concentrations of fasting, postbreakfast, postlunch, and postdinner plasma glucose. Twenty-four-hour mean glucose concentrations showed a slightly greater decrease from baseline for the twice-daily regimen; the difference between the regimens was statistically significant but not clinically meaningful. The incidence of adverse events with glimepiride approximated that obtained with placebo, with both groups reporting only one adverse event, headache, in more than 5% of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride is equally effective whether administered once or twice daily. Glimepiride seems to stimulate insulin production primarily after meals, when plasma glucose concentrations are highest, but controls blood glucose throughout the day.", "outbound_citations": ["8908379", "8529506", "7821171", "8172913", "8137714", "1602014", "1610416", "2716163", "3180635", "3511094", "6373457", "830562"], "inbound_citations": ["33553033", "31937146"], "label": "1"}

Thirty\u2010nine mildly obese NIDDM patients (BMI 25.6 \u00b1 0.5) were randomized after 6 weeks of intensive insulin treatment to either a combination treatment (CT, n\u2009=\u200920) or continued intensive insulin treatment (IT, n\u2009=\u200919). There were no differences between the two groups in age, diabetes duration, BMI, HbA1c, or basal and glucagon stimulated C\u2010peptide. The patients were followed for 1 year and the findings were analysed on an intent to treat basis. Two patients in the CT group were excluded after 2 and 6 months, respectively, due to unacceptably high postprandial glucose values. There was a significant difference in HbA1c between the CT and IT groups at 6 months (8.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2, n\u2009=\u200919, vs 6.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4%, n\u2009=\u200919, p\u2009<\u20090.001)), but not at 12 months (7.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3, n\u2009=\u200918, vs 7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4%, n\u2009=\u200919). After the initial intensive insulin treatment, BMI was constant in the CT group but increased significantly at 6 and 12 months in the IT group. We conclude that both treatments are associated with a marked and long\u2010term improvement of glycaemic control. The intensive insulin treatment leads to a more pronounced weight increase which in the long run might have negative effect on overall metabolic control. Therefore, the combination treatment together with intensified education and dietary advice should be regarded as the initial treatment of choice for oral agent failure in moderately obese NIDDM patients.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

The repaglinide regimen, in which a dose was taken before each main meal, was more effective in improving glycemic control (including postprandial glucose and HbA(1c) levels) than the same total dose of repaglinide divided into morning and evening mealtime doses.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data support the strategy of mealtime dosing with repaglinide. The improvements in glycemic control observed in these patients are encouraging. In addition to classic parameters of glycemic control, improvements in postprandial glucose excursions may prove to be important because postprandial hyperglycemia has been suggested to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["11472451", "11194214", "11063283", "11063282", "10631622", "10611470", "10445835", "10369424", "9868996", "9868989", "9802740", "9742976", "9533980", "9519738", "9421381", "9439558", "8894476", "8592553", "8712804", "8529509", "7914964", "1727062", "1838063", "2226113", "3283554", "2888696", "1262429"], "inbound_citations": ["33025623"], "label": "1"}

Others who are frail and have multiple pathologies may require treatment to prevent both symptomatic hyperglycaemia and dehydration, whilst avoiding hypoglycaemia. The goals in the management of NIDDM in elderly people are the prevention of complications and the relief of symptoms. Treatment must be tailored to the individual's expectations and should be reviewed regularly with the changing circumstances of aging. If dietary measures fail to control glucose levels, antihyperglycaemic sulphonylureas are the most frequently prescribed form of treatment. However, concern over the potential of these drugs to cause hypoglycaemia limits the choice to second generation sulphonylureas, agents that preserve the first phase of insulin release and have non-biologically active metabolites that are promptly eliminated. The biguanide agent metformin is also appropriate in elderly obese patients with NIDDM who do not have renal, liver or cardiac failure. The combination of a sulphonylurea and metformin can be effective in patients in whom insulin would otherwise be required.

Suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia is considered to be very important for preventing diabetic complications. Sulfonylureas are well-known insulin secretagogues and have been widely used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. These agents, however, do not appear to be able to ameliorate impairment of the first phase of insulin secretion and postprandial hyperglycemia. Nateglinide, which is a derivative of D-phenylalanine, is a non-sulfonylurea insulin secretagogue. Although the in vitro insulin-releasing effect of nateglinide is similar to that of sulfonylureas, its hypoglycemic effect is more rapid and short lasting. The in vivo unique pharmacodynamic profile of nateglinide is likely to result from its rapid absorption and elimination. This novel antidiabetic agent has made it possible to compensate for the impaired first phase insulin response and thus suppresses postprandial hyperglycemia. In clinical trials, nateglinide reduced prandial glucose excursion and improved early phase of insulin release dose-dependently after 12 weeks treatment.

The aim of this study was to quantitate the improvement in glycemic control achieved with Mix25 versus the maximum dose of glyburide (GB) in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with GB. In this randomized, parallel, open-label comparative study, patients with type 2 diabetes received either Mix25 before the morning and evening meals for 4 months or GB 15 mg daily for 4 months. Glycemic control was assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements, 4-point self-monitored blood glucose profiles, and patient-reported hypoglycemia. Patients also completed a treatment satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the study. All 172 patients were white; 85 were randomized to receive Mix25. The mean age was 59.5 +/- 8.2 years, and 35.5% (61/172) were men. The mean body mass index was 27.2 kg/m2. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 10.2 +/- 6.6 years, and the mean duration of sulfonylurea treatment was 5.8 +/- 5.9 years. The mean HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels were 10.07% +/- 1.4% and 11.6 +/- 2.8 mmol/L, respectively, in the glyburide group and 9.85% +/- 1.2% and 12.2 +/- 2.9 mmol/L, respectively, in the Mix25 group. There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups at baseline for any of the demographic or efficacy variables. At end point, mean HbA1c was significantly lower in the Mix25 group than in the GB group (Mix25, 8.5% +/- 1.3%; GB, 9.4% +/- 1.8%; P = 0.001). A larger decrease from baseline in HbA1c and in all self-monitored blood glucose values was observed in the Mix25 group: -1.4% versus -0.7% for HbA1c, P = 0.004; -2.8 mmol/L versus -1.1 mmol/L for fasting blood glucose, P < 0.01; -5.1 mmol/L versus -1.7 mmol/L for the morning 2-hour postprandial blood glucose, P < 0.001; -2.2 mmol/L versus -0.8 mmol/L for the evening preprandial blood glucose, P < 0.05; and -4.4 mmol/L versus -1.5 mmol/L for the evening 2-hour postprandial blood glucose, P < 0.001. Patients expressed more satisfaction with Mix25 than with GB, as measured by the weighted combined score on a treatment satisfaction questionnaire (2.0 +/- 1.3 vs 0.7 +/- 1.3). The mean hypoglycemia rate (events per patient per 30 days) was significantly higher in the Mix25 group at end point (Mix25, 0.30 +/- 0.53; GB, 0.05 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001). Compared with maximum-dose GB, twice-daily injections of Mix25 resulted in improved glycemic control and treatment satisfaction, and were associated with a predictably higher rate of hypoglycemia in this group of patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled with maximum-dose GB. Although the inclusion of patients who were inadequately controlled with GB was intended to allow a comparison of the 2 treatments with respect to efficacy and tolerability in a real-life setting, a double-blind comparison in treatment-naive individuals may have resulted in a different outcome.", "outbound_citations": ["10938048", "10826515", "10599979", "10480768", "10073958", "9793758", "9614608", "9545118", "9405909", "9388085", "9272617", "8960845", "8366922", "4958706"], "inbound_citations": ["34342864"], "label": "0"}

In view of the pressing need for more effective oral agents for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, troglitazone was granted priority review by the FDA and was launched in the USA in 1997. The first of the thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizing agents, troglitazone was quickly followed by rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. The glitazones proved to be effective not only in lowering blood glucose, but also to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk. Troglitazone was subsequently withdrawn because of concerns about hepatotoxicity, which appears to be less of a problem with rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. Recent insights into the molecular mechanism of action of the glitazones, which are ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, open the prospect of designing more effective, selective and safer antidiabetic agents.

Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent; it lowers the blood glucose concentration without causing hypoglycemia. Proposed mechanisms of action include decreased intestinal absorption of glucose, increased glucose uptake from the blood into the tissues, decreased glucose production in the liver, and decreased insulin requirements for glucose disposal. Metformin is slowly absorbed from the small intestine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism. The half-life is about five hours. The major route of elimination is renal; the drug is contraindicated in patients with impaired renal function. In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, metformin has shown efficacy in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The drug is as effective as sulfonylureas in patients with diabetes who are nonobese or obese and whose diabetes is uncontrolled by diet alone. Metformin may be useful as addon therapy in obese patients with diabetes uncontrolled by sulfonylureas and diet. Lipid profiles may be favorably influenced. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal. A rare but potentially fatal adverse effect is lactic acidosis. Metformin has the potential to interact with cationic drugs eliminated by the renal tubular pathway. The usual effective dosage is 1.5-2.5 g/day orally in two or three divided doses. Metformin hydrochloride is an effective alternative to sulfonylureas in obese and non-obese patients with NIDDM in whom diet alone has not achieved glycemic control, and it may be useful as addon therapy in patients whose diabetes has not responded adequately to sulfonylureas plus dietary measures.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36839770", "36041596", "35048767", "34599229", "33248407", "32916966", "31284513", "29064399", "28544884", "28495567", "26479769", "27182828", "26608080", "25261963", "25424352", "25315294", "25459661", "25473337", "24778350", "24031162", "23960811", "22222626", "21319871", "21567399", "21731875", "20977579", "19761101", "20490303", "18608813", "18401339", "18762711", "17876861", "17600084", "17339833", "21475454", "16698134", "15963007"], "label": "0"}

Repaglinide was administered 15 minutes before meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Efficacy of repaglinide therapy was assessed by measuring changes from baseline in mean levels of blood glucose (BGmean), fasting serum glucose (FSG), and mean levels of serum insulin (INSmean).\n\n\nRESULTS\nBlood concentrations of repaglinide were proportional to the dose administered. INSmean values increased in all repaglinide treatment groups (by 6.7 to 12.9 microU/mL). All doses of repaglinide significantly decreased values of BGmean and FSG as compared with the placebo group. BGmean values stabilized between the second and third week of repaglinide treatment. A well-defined dose-response relationship was observed for BGmean and FSG values. All doses of repaglinide were well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings show that the therapeutic reduction of serum glucose levels produced by repaglinide is dose-dependent for the 0.25- to 4-mg dose range.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Fourteen nonobese normotensive NIDDM men (aged 44.5 \u00b1 5.1 years) underwent a 2-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (40 mU\u00b7m\u22122 \u00b7 min\u22121). Baseline evaluation of insulin sensitivity was followed by the random assignment of each patient to either captopril or placebo treatment, according to a crossover double-blind design. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were then repeated for all patients after both placebo and captopril treatments. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) levels were assessed before, during, and after each clamp. RESULTS Resulting data showed that plasma catecholamine levels increased during baseline euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (NE: +23.6% time 0 vs. time 120 min, P < 0.05; E: +24.8% time 0 vs. time 120 min, P < 0.05).

However, the magnitude of the NE (+25.7% time 0 vs. time 120 min, P < 0.001) and E (+27.2% time 0 vs. time 120 min, P < 0.05) increments during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia were not affected by the drug. Percentage changes in the ratio of total body glucose uptake to circulating insulin levels and corresponding decrements of baseline plasma E levels after captopril therapy were negatively correlated (r = \u22120.57, P < 0.05).

Subjects received nateglinide (30, 60, and 120 mg) or placebo before each main meal. Metabolic effectiveness was assessed during a standardized meal challenge performed before and after the 8-week treatment. All adverse events (AEs) were recorded, and confirmed hypoglycemia was defined as symptoms accompanied by a self-monitoring of blood glucose measurement < or =3.3 mmol/l (plasma glucose < or =3.7 mmol/l).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNateglinide elicited a dose-related increase of insulin and a decrease of glucose during standardized meal challenges, with the predominant effect on early insulin release, leading to a substantial reduction in peak plasma glucose levels. Nateglinide was well tolerated, and symptoms of hypoglycemia were the only treatment-emergent AEs. Confirmed hypoglycemia occurred in 28 subjects receiving nateglinide (30 mg, 0 [0%]; 60 mg, 5 [6.6%]; 120 mg, 23 [26.7%]) and in 1 (2.3%) subject receiving placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNateglinide was safe and effective in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia in subjects with IGT.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Sulfonylurea-treated patients, with inadequate glycemic control, were treated with metformin in either a placebo-controlled or open fashion. Measurements were made of 1) fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations; 2) glucose appearance and disappearance rates measured overnight with 3-[3H]glucose; and 3) plasma FFA concentrations during a 45-min infusion period at relatively low (\u223c 60 pmol/l) insulin concentrations. RESULTS Mean \u00b1 SE hourly plasma glucose, insulin, and FFA concentrations were similar before and after treatment in the placebo group. In contrast, mean hourly plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower (P < 0.005) after metformin treatment in both the placebo-controlled and open-label groups (\u22123.9 \u00b1 1.0 and \u22124.4 \u00b1 0.8 mmol/l, respectively). Similarly, day-long hourly FFA levels were lower (P < 0.005) following metformin in the placebo-controlled and open-label groups (\u221287 \u00b1 35 and \u2212136 \u00b1 31 \u03bcmol/l, respectively). Plasma insulin concentrations did not change with treatment in any group. Overnight glucose turnover studies indicated that neither the rate of glucose appearance (hepatic glucose production) or glucose disappearance changed significantly with treatment in the placebo or metformin groups. Because plasma glucose concentration was much lower after metformin treatment, overnight glucose metabolic clearance rate was significantly (P < 0.001) lower in this group. Finally, plasma FFA concentrations in response to a low-dosage insulin infusion (5 mU \u00b7 m\u22122 \u00b7 min\u22121) were significantly lower after metformin as compared with the placebo-treated group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Metformin treatment was associated with significantly lower day-long plasma glucose and FFA concentrations. Although overnight hepatic glucose production was unchanged following treatment with metformin, the overnight glucose metabolic clearance rate significantly increased. Given these findings, it is suggested that at least part of the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin is due to an increase in glucose uptake, secondary to a decrease in release of FFA from adipose tissue, and lower circulating FFA concentrations.", "outbound_citations": ["9062490", "8923861", "8529483", "7623903", "7958496", "7821127", "1600836", "1569149", "1955512", "1752350", "2068893", "2404714", "3292322", "3552795", "3817257", "3900120", "4690904", "5776547", "13990765", "13952078", "13833973"], "inbound_citations": ["33558906", "30306875", "30912338"], "label": "0"}

After a 3-week placebo washout, patients received a 14-week course of placebo or glimepiride 8 mg q.d., 4 mg b.i.d., 16 mg q.d., or 8 mg b.i.d. RESULTS Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c values were similar at baseline in all treatment groups. The placebo group's FPG value increased from 13.0 mmol/l at baseline to 14.5 mmol/l at the last evaluation endpoint (P \u2264 0.001). In contrast, FPG values in the four glimepiride groups decreased from a range of 12.4\u201312.9 mmol/l at baseline to a range of 8.6\u20139.8 mmol/l at endpoint (P \u2264 0.001, within-group change from baseline; P \u2264 0.001, between-group change [vs. placebo] from baseline).

One hundred percent of patients receiving glyburide-metformin tablets were screened for inclusion. Patients with at least 6 months of prior SU+Met combination therapy and a baseline A1C measured within 35 days prior to or 3 days after switch to glyburide-metformin tablets were included. At least one documented follow-up A1C at >or=90 days after the switch to glyburide-metformin was required for inclusion. Glycemic control, complications, lipid parameters, concomitant medications, and weight were analyzed prior to and following the switch to glyburide-metformin.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-two patient records were included after the disqualification criteria excluded 488 prospective patients. The mean age of the 72 patients was 62 years; average body mass index was 32.9 kg/m2, average baseline A1C was 8.3%, and the average time since diagnosis was 7.6 years. The mean reduction in A1C was 0.6% (P=0.002) at a mean follow-up of 196 days after the switch to glyburide-metformin tablets. Improvement in glycemic control was predominantly seen in patients with a baseline A1C >or=8% in whom a 1.3% mean reduction in A1C (P=0.0002) was achieved despite a lower mean final dose of glyburide.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of this study suggest that in type 2 diabetic patients with an A1C >or=8%, switching from coadministration of a sulfonylurea plus metformin to combination glyburide-metformin tablets may provide an improvement in glycemic control in the range of a 1.2 to 1.4 absolute percentage point decrease in A1C.

Exogenous insulin is ultimately required in a substantial proportion, reflecting the progressive natural history of the disease. Sulphonylureas and biguanides have been employed for over 4 decades as oral antidiabetic agents, but they have a limited capacity to provide long term glycaemic control and can cause serious adverse effects. Thus, more efficacious and tolerable antidiabetic agents are required. Recent years have witnessed the introduction of agents with novel modes of action, that is, the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors acarbose and miglitol (which reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia) and the first of the thiazolidinedione insulinsensitising drugs--troglitazone and rosiglitazone. Although the former has been withdrawn in some countries due to adverse effects, another 'glitazone' pioglitazone is expected to be approved in the near future. Other recently introduced drugs include glimepiride and the meglitinide insulin secretagogue, repaglinide. Attention is also focusing increasingly on combination therapy using insulin together with sulphonylureas, metformin or troglitazone. Rapid-acting insulin analogues are now being used as alternatives to conventional insulins; their role in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus is presently uncertain but reports of a reduced frequency of hypoglycaemia are encouraging. The development of new drugs aims to counter the principal metabolic defects of the disorder, respectively, relative insulin deficiency and insulin resistance. Novel classes of rapid-acting secretagogues under evaluation include the morphilinoguanide BTS 67582 and the meglitinides mitiglinide (KAD 1229) and senaglinide (A-4166). Succinate ester derivatives represent a potential novel approach to improving beta-cell function through enhancement of insulin biosynthesis and secretion. Enhancement of nutrient-induced insulin secretion is a mechanism with several putative targets within the beta-cell; potentiators of insulin secretion include glucagon-like peptide-1 and its analogues, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and the imidazoline derivative PMS 812 (S 21663). The amylin agonist pramlintide slows gastric emptying and suppression of glucagon secretion.

All patients were on stable treatment with a second generation sulphonylurea for at least 8 weeks prior to randomization and received placebo (P) or 5\u2009mg glimepiride (G) daily for 7 days and 10\u2009mg prior to a hyperglycaemic clamp (10.9\u2009mmol\u2009l\u22121 for 60\u2009min, preceded by i.v. insulin infusion to stablize fasting blood glucose levels at 4.0\u2009mmol\u2009l\u22121). The clamp was followed by an observation period of 2\u2009h in 5 subjects and 3.5\u2009h in the next 9 subjects, during which blood glucose and plasma insulin, C\u2010peptide and proinsulin levels were measured at regular intervals to determine the effect of glimepiride on the interaction between changes in glycaemia and plasma levels of beta cell products. Neither G nor P elicited a first phase insulin response. Areas under plasma insulin curve during the 1\u2009h hyperglycaemic clamp were 94.2 (39.5) vs 69.1 (26.5)\u2009pmol.h\u2009l\u22121 in G and P clamps, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Total areas (AUC) under the plasma insulin curve were 377 (145) vs 271 (113)\u2009pmol.h\u2009l\u22121 in G and P clamps (<\u20090.05).

Five hours after G and P administration blood glucose levels were 4.7) 92.1) mmol\u22121 in the G clamp vs 6.2 (1.9) mmol\u2009l\u22121 in the P clamp (p\u2009=\u20090.001). The number of hypoglycaemic events (blood glucose <\u20093.0\u2009mmol\u2009l\u22121) in the 3.5\u2009h observation period was 3 in G clamps vs 0 in P clamps (p\u2009=\u2009ns). In conclusion, glimepiride stimulates the second phase insulin and proinsulin secretion. The lowering of blood glucose levels is not accompanied by a commensurate inhibition of the insulin secretion.

The women were randomly assigned between 11 and 33 weeks of gestation to receive glyburide or insulin according to an intensified treatment protocol. The primary end point was achievement of the desired level of glycemic control. Secondary end points included maternal and neonatal complications.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean (+/-SD) pretreatment blood glucose concentration as measured at home for one week was 114+/-19 mg per deciliter (6.4+/-1.1 mmol per liter) in the glyburide group and 116+/-22 mg per deciliter (6.5+/-1.2 mmol per liter) in the insulin group (P=0.33). The mean concentrations during treatment were 105+/-16 mg per deciliter (5.9+/-0.9 mmol per liter) in the glyburide group and 105+/-18 mg per deciliter (5.9+/-1.0 mmol per liter) in the insulin group (P=0.99). Eight women in the glyburide group (4 percent) required insulin therapy. There were no significant differences between the glyburide and insulin groups in the percentage of infants who were large for gestational age (12 percent and 13 percent, respectively); who had macrosomia, defined as a birth weight of 4000 g or more (7 percent and 4 percent); who had lung complications (8 percent and 6 percent); who had hypoglycemia (9 percent and 6 percent); who were admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (6 percent and 7 percent); or who had fetal anomalies (2 percent and 2 percent).

The majority of NIDDM patients are treated with sulphonylurea (SU) derivatives. In the 1970's the University Group Diabetes Program concluded that tolbutamide treatment caused increased cardiovascular mortality; the study, which led to curtailment of oral antidiabetic treatment in the USA, was received with scepticism in Europe. Later criticism of its methodology reduced the impact of the study; however, the question of the safety of SU in NIDDM patients with cardiovascular disease has been re-opened in the face of new experimental data. The heart and vascular tissues do have prerequisites for SU action, i.e. SU receptors and ATP-dependent K+ (K+ATP) channels. These channels play an important role in the protection of the myocardium against ischaemia-reperfusion damage, and their closure by SU could lead to amplified ischaemic damage. Here we review evidence from animal and human studies for deleterious SU effects on ischaemia-induced myocardial damage, either by direct action or through diminished cardioprotective preconditioning. Closure of K+ATP channels by SU can lead to reduction of post-infarct arrhythmias; the drug has also been claimed to improve various atherosclerosis risk factors. The evidence for these beneficial effects of SU is also reviewed. We look at the major difficulties that hamper transfer of information from experimental studies to clinical decision-making: a) The affinity of SU for heart K+ATP channels is orders of magnitude lower than for beta-cell channels; is it reasonable to expect in vivo cardiac effects with therapeutic 'pancreatic' SU doses? b) Most studies utilized high doses of acutely administered SU; are effects similar in the chronic steady-state of the SU-treated diabetic patient? c) Convincing SU effects have been demonstrated in acutely induced ischaemia by acutely administering the drug; do such effects persist in the clinical situation of gradually progressive ischaemia? d) Ischaemia and modification of K+ATP channel activity induce complex events, some with opposing effects; what is the net result of SU action, and do different SU derivatives lead to different outcomes? e) In the chronic (and hence clinically relevant) situation, how can direct (deleterious or beneficial) SU effects be separated from beneficial effects mediated by the metabolic action of the drug? Only large prospective clinical studies, making use of advanced technology for assessment of cardiovascular function, can answer these questions. Millions of NIDDM patients are treated with SU derivatives; many are in the age group where cardiovascular risks are extremely high. The question of whether SU derivatives are beneficial or deleterious for these patients must finally be settle unequivocally.", "outbound_citations": ["8864641", "2285630", "640303", "4943989", "8251420", "1637728", "3133266", "7060853", "6781964", "11826275", "10189558", "7589820", "7797776", "7753861", "7716547", "7768272", "7744216", "7814627", "7943380", "7954642", "7995278", "8044938", "7958731", "7923271", "7923295", "7923294", "28984968", "7515993", "8124811", "8141383", "8137680", "8003091", "8263798", "8131754", "8238595", "8403330", "8222340", "8287432", "8353886", "8281370", "8359098", "8388636", "8498546", "8496806", "8324796", "8324797", "8324795", "8324798", "8447462", "7679150", "7679152", "8435984", "8458028", "8380263", "1291083", "1291084", "1291082", "1291081", "1486593", "1415759", "1512336", "1510137", "1590361", "1446318", "1574013", "1574014", "1280739", "1548049", "1310443", "1465473", "1296186", "1762089", "1836311", "1750525", "1788832", "1934364", "1939661", "1920138", "1934346", "1887923", "1909503", "1651815", "1885230", "1872305", "1908183", "1707221", "1908354", "1984872", "2242528", "2118729", "2372907", "2107575", "2105170", "2293241", "2677730", "2507775", "2506353", "2501869", "2664879", "3146398", "2453509", "3402292", "3350040", "3301149", "3543616", "3563983", "3530855", "3769170", "3931464", "3896601", "6439036", "6439532", "6433503", "6582347", "6369972", "6310409", "7103631", "6285503", "7128193", "7058826", "6794745", "6782875", "6781341", "7460722", "6104171", "7380107", "370980", "430798", "78295", "416518", "992232", "807945", "4131883", "5055722", "4937385", "4883948", "6019354", "13698486", "13651768", "6989693", "7681934", "2082905", "7021124", "8030926"], "inbound_citations": ["35377559"], "label": "1"}

Women with GD often have impaired pancreatic \u03b2-cell compensation for insulin resistance. The nature of GD is currently contentious, with debate about its existence, diagnosis and ramifications for both mother and offspring from pregnancy into later life. Also contentious are the outcomes of intervention with diet, insulin, glyburide (Glynase\u2122, Pharmacia Upjohn) and metformin (Glucophage\u2122, Bristol-Myers Squibb). There is consensus that women with unequivocal GD have a significant risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and increased risk of later type 2 diabetes mellitus. Foetuses from pregnancies with GD have a higher risk of macrosomia (associated with higher rate of birth injuries), asphyxia, and neonatal hypoglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia. Uncontrolled GD predisposes foetuses to accelerated, excessive fat accumulation, insulin resistance, pancreatic exhaustion secondary to prenatal hyperglycaemia and possible higher risk of child and adult obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus later in adult life. However, there is no consensus as to whether glucose intolerance of a severity below unequivocal GD is related to adverse maternal, fetal or perinatal outcomes, and whether this relationship is a continuous one. If dietary intervention is not sufficient in the treatment of GD, then, historically, insulin has been added. Recent studies suggest that glyburide may be efficaciously substituted for insulin.

Nevertheless, these agents do cause hypoglycemia in clinical practice, suggesting that accompanying factors must typically be present for hypoglycemia to occur. Ethanol is one putative risk factor that has not been evaluated as a mechanism for low blood glucose among sulfonylurea users. We hypothesized that low concentrations of ethanol would reduce blood glucose concentrations in elderly type 2 diabetic patients receiving sulfonylureas during a short-term fast.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA total of 10 type 2 diabetic patients, aged 68 +/- 3 years and receiving 20 mg glyburide daily, participated in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled in-patient study consisting of two 24-h fasts at least 1 week apart. During hours 14 and 15 of the fasting studies, subjects received intravenous infusions of either 4.35 mmol.kg-1.h-1 ethanol (equivalent to one or two alcoholic beverages) or saline placebo in random order. Ethanol, plasma glucose, insulin, and counterregulatory hormones were assessed very 30-60 min during the final 10 h of the fast.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBlood ethanol levels peaked at 17 +/- 2 mmol/l (the lower legal limit of intoxication in New Mexico) during the ethanol study. Plasma glucose concentrations did not differ at baseline (placebo 8.5 +/- 1.8 vs. ethanol 8.7 +/- 1.7 mmol/l; P = 0.50), but nadir plasma glucose was lower after the ethanol infusion compared with placebo (4.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.4 mmol/l; P = 0.01), and the absolute decline in plasma glucose was also greater during the ethanol study than the placebo study (4.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.2 mmol/l; P = 0.01). Counterregulatory hormone levels were increased during the ethanol study and nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were suppressed compared with the placebo study.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLow doses of ethanol predispose fasted elderly type 2 diabetic patients to low blood glucose during a short-term fast. This may be one of several mechanisms by which sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia occurs in elderly patients.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34826511", "34363981", "31234649"], "label": "0"}

NeuroShell Predictor was used to create predictive PK and PK/PD models using population covariates: evaluate the relative significance of different covariates; and simulate the effect of covariates on the PK/PD of REP. Predictive performance was evaluated by calculating root mean square error and mean error for the training and test sets.

Glimepiride therapy ameliorates the relative insulin secretory deficit found in most patients with Type 2 DM. It is a direct insulin secretagogue; indirectly, it also increases insulin secretion in response to fuels such as glucose. Its action to augment insulin secretion requires binding to a high affinity sulfonylurea receptor, which results in closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the \u03b2-cells of the pancreas. The question has been raised whether insulin secretagogues by acting on vascular or myocardial potassium channels may prevent ischaemic preconditioning, a physiological adaptation that could affect the outcome of coronary heart disease, but there is evidence against this concern being applicable to glimepiride. Glimepiride\u2019s antihyperglycaemic efficacy is equal to other secretagogues. It has pharmacokinetic properties that make it less prone to cause hypoglycaemia in renal dysfunction than some other insulin secretagogues, particularly glyburide (also known as glibenclamide in Europe). Its convenient once daily dosing may enhance compliance for diabetic patients who often also require medications for other co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and cardiac disease. Glimepiride is approved for monotherapy, for combination with metformin and with insulin. Clinically, its reduced risk of hypoglycaemia makes it preferable to some other insulin secretagogues when attempting to achieve recommended glycaemic control (haemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) 7%). Using suppertime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) and regular insulin with morning glimepiride in overweight diabetic patients achieves glycaemic goals more quickly than insulin alone and with lower insulin doses.", "outbound_citations": ["11730409", "10977060", "10906831", "10500931", "10491749", "10068412", "10213347", "9988102", "10641958", "9935017", "9793597", "9742977", "9742976", "9702849", "9653594", "9816551", "9450510", "9250229", "9250272", "9184703", "9169397", "9118760", "9096986", "8960852", "8908379", "8911976", "8911979", "8911975", "8911977", "8675920", "8592553", "8572835", "8911978", "8842603", "7589820", "8172913", "8172912", "2019232", "2192851", "6985989", "100879", "4693651", "4626706", "5055722", "4926376", "13766421"], "inbound_citations": ["36154547", "35980254", "30998259", "28069690", "27749986", "25902398", "26235578", "21645507", "19394976", "30743802", "17438539", "17580731", "16448524", "16555581", "16291411", "15955382", "15963007", "15899724", "15938589"], "label": "0"}

However, the sequence with which these abnormalities develop and their relative contributions to the deterioration in glucose tolerance remain unclear in the absence of a detailed longitudinal study. We measured insulin action, insulin secretion, and EGO longitudinally in 17 Pima Indians, in whom glucose tolerance deteriorated from normal (NGT) to impaired (IGT) to diabetic over 5.1 +/- 1.4 years. Transition from NGT to IGT was associated with an increase in body weight, a decline in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, and a decline in the acute insulin secretory response (AIR) to intravenous glucose, but no change in EGO. Progression from IGT to diabetes was accompanied by a further increase in body weight, further decreases in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and AIR, and an increase in basal EGO. Thirty-one subjects who retained NGT over a similar period also gained weight, but their AIR increased with decreasing insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. Thus, defects in insulin secretion and insulin action occur early in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Intervention to prevent diabetes should target both abnormalities.", "outbound_citations": ["10837696", "9794097", "9715376", "9715377", "9593781", "9166672", "8894478", "8894480", "8894494", "8741811", "7621989", "7776502", "7555498", "7745002", "7706588", "8194657", "8247074", "8286893", "1468279", "1357346", "1587397", "1532777", "1446799", "2060716", "1996593", "2240915", "2142037", "2305878", "2192853", "2403659", "2684710", "2664520", "2669517", "3061759", "3289994", "3289989", "3283552", "2888695", "3782471", "2874367", "3785342", "4043554", "6384267", "6381035", "6368588", "7033284", "7304597", "1262429", "4552828", "5320561", "13846364", "510803", "3056758", "8307264", "873087", "2651188", "PMC425290", "680420", "8897008", "7713313", "6368299", "2226113", "PMC425083", "3724804", "PMC370948", "PMC441860", "PMC508813"], "inbound_citations": ["37274075", "37200193", "37175407", "37074460", "37043764", "37039787", "37019209", "36809666", "36732513", "36722675", "36639363", "36607714", "36699697", "36614099", "36549505", "36515429", "36410808", "36379585", "36618207", "36098986", "36636157", "36133303", "36505570", "36052175", "35963508", "35958436", "35841511", "35887628", "35717608", "35672344", "36066975", "36119208", "35789836", "35711466", "35508700", "35563231", "35625542", "35401987", "35388742", "35398458", "35273012", "35177456", "35145521", "35098041", "36402758", "35014695", "35055114", "34986330", "35011414", "34907913", "34882233", "34924860", "34843575", "34758676", "34909309", "34879878", "35984746", "34685528", "34561756", "34531293", "34515712", "34514962", "34480921", "34435523", "34353431", "34328151", "34366888", "34295307", "34359828", "34167340", "34180979", "34202289", "34220720", "34134670", "34129880", "34236436", "34207117", "34038037", "34048878", "34043987", "33972266", "33949781", "33945140", "33909115", "33996878", "33907839", "33831017", "33789013", "33981968", "33855087", "33752962", "33801107", "33663065", "33629672", "33555104", "33555509", "33522574", "33438363", "33404681", "33381668", "33542706", "33450674", "33261310", "33339276", "33074334", "33188364", "33168187", "33103448", "33398163", "33031022", "33021063", "33134765", "32987447", "34594226", "32909364", "32894311", "32957570", "32872570", "32818236", "32648492", "32601731", "32543261", "32582035", "32514025", "32445642", "32398822", "32359342", "32359533", "32546421", "32304086", "32284091", "32245801", "32196463", "32212859", "32704550", "32217418", "32172486", "32190805", "32257185", "32195965", "32109481", "32017043", "31968196", "31915054", "32051868", "31863731", "31657690", "31141300", "31872946", "31817135", "31827624", "31349033", "31776781", "31763965", "31757217", "31720686", "31693217", "31853220", "31656034", "31641146", "31624901", "31058974", "31477552", "31496771", "31440379", "31237447", "31528832", "31355254", "31121197", "31203377", "31258879", "31178434", "31263559", "30629195", "31446783", "31082326", "30734926", "30677460", "30575251", "31091555", "30907023", "30566658", "30889184", "30731237", "31156786", "30774722", "30371047", "30549138", "30252100", "30095210", "30616241", "31013454", "30689089", "30601759", "29879890", "30557891", "30574122", "30598071", "30244052", "30328570", "30316589", "30282699", "30227659", "29669179", "29862649", "29967428", "29997524", "29947782", "29925687", "29947922", "29892337", "29865281", "30591792", "29779165", "29754817", "29719132", "29750032", "29451713", "29320716", "29351481", "29732459", "29650631", "29649104", "29540618", "29514765", "29407055", "29253625", "29471797", "29216357", "28948712", "29219149", "29629377", "28816105", "29316644", "29416823", "29207196", "29146554", "29289263", "29938604", "28886131", "29951823", "29125983", "28890858", "29263705", "29129207", "29300920", "28744906", "29183909", "28934667", "29093479"], "label": "0"}

After baseline oral (OGTT) and intravenous (IVGTT) glucose tolerance testing, subjects were assigned to take placebo or 200 or 400 mg troglitazone daily for 12 weeks (14 subjects per treatment group). An OGTT and IVGTT were repeated during the 12th week of treatment. Five subjects failed to complete the trial for personal reasons, and medication compliance averaged 90% in the remaining subjects, none of whom experienced a serious adverse event. SI, calculated by minimal model analysis of IVGTT results, changed by only 4 \u00b1 14% during 12 weeks of placebo administration, but increased 40 \u00b1 22 and 88 \u00b1 22% above basal during treatment with 200 and 400 mg troglitazone, respectively (P = 0.01 among groups). Troglitazone administration was also associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the total insulin area during IVGTTs, which was highly significant (P < 0.001), and with a reduction during OGTTs, which approached statistical significance (P = 0.09). Glucose tolerance improved slightly in all groups, but the magnitude of change did not differ significantly among groups, whether it was assessed as the number of subjects who continued to manifest IGT at 12 weeks (P = 0.64 among groups), the change in total glucose area during OGTTs (P = 0.58), or the change in fractional glucose disappearance rates during IVGTTs (P = 0.28). Among the women who received troglitazone, the greatest improvement in SI occurred in the women who had the highest diastolic blood pressures and the best IVGTT insulin responses during baseline testing. Our findings indicate that troglitazone improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and lowered circulating insulin concentrations in women with prior GDM who are at very high risk for NIDDM. The lack of improvement in glucose tolerance despite improved insulin sensitivity may be a manifestation of the \u03b2-cell defect that predisposes the women to NIDDM. The overall pattern of response to troglitazone in our high-risk patients indicates that the drug is an ideal agent with which to test whether the amelioration of insulin resistance can delay or prevent diabetes in women with limited \u03b2-cell reserve.", "outbound_citations": ["8551882", "8612437", "7657026", "7615805", "7729607", "7729620", "7958495", "7935656", "7926313", "7866471", "7926289", "8299456", "8405710", "8333511", "8430789", "1530012", "1615892", "1642145", "1547676", "1653663", "2058668", "2183610", "2663745", "3315786", "3538877", "6812986", "7033284", "4818200", "4337382", "4220952"], "inbound_citations": ["36636157", "34218657", "33306495", "32982969", "31470636", "30360536", "29056338"], "label": "0"}

However, the group that received intensive treatment had more hypoglycemic episodes and gained more weight than the group that received conventional treatment (1). Overweight patients in a substudy of the same trial who received metformin gained less weight and had fewer hypoglycemic episodes than those treated with either insulin or sulfonylureas (2). Patients who received metformin also had a more favorable outcome with respect to the development of diabetes-related end points, all-cause mortality, and stroke (2). The UKPDS did not, however, address the usual clinical problem of how patients whose diabetes is poorly controlled with oral agents should be treated with insulin. Previous controlled trials comparing various insulin regimens in patients whose type 2 diabetes is poorly controlled with oral agents are sparse and have included small numbers of patients; in addition, only a few have lasted 3 months or longer (3-8). In the largest of these studies, patients previously treated with sulfonylureas and metformin gained more weight when they received multiple insulin injections than when they received a combination of bedtime insulin, sulfonylurea, and metformin (6, 7). Whether the difference in weight gain was attributable to the number of insulin injections; serum insulin levels; or the use of sulfonylurea, metformin, or both remained unclear. We compared four different bedtime insulin regimens to evaluate their effects on weight gain, frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes whose disease was inadequately controlled with sulfonylurea therapy alone. We randomly assigned 96 patients with type 2 diabetes to 1 year of treatment with bedtime insulin plus glyburide and placebo, metformin and placebo, glyburide and metformin, or a second injection of insulin. Methods Design The study protocol, which was investigator initiated, consisted of a 6-week run-in period and 12 months of insulin therapy. Patients were recruited from regional health centers to four trial centers by using the following inclusion criteria: age 40 to 70 years, body mass index less than 35 kg/m2, fasting blood glucose level greater than 8 mmol/L [>144 mg/dL], duration of diabetes more than 3 years, previous oral therapy with either glipizide (>15 mg/d) or glyburide (>10 mg/d), and fasting serum C-peptide level more than 0.33 nmol/L (reference range, 0.33 to 0.69 nmol/L [>0.99 ng/mL; reference range, 1.0 to 2.0 ng/mL]). Exclusion criteria were congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke in the past 6 months; epilepsy or other severe disease; liver disease, serum creatinine concentration greater than 120 mol/L [1.36 mg/dL], or macroalbuminuria; proliferative retinopathy or severe maculopathy; previous insulin therapy for more than 2 weeks; excessive alcohol consumption (>20 g/d); and night work. At each center, the patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the respective ethical committees for human investigation. Six Weeks before Study Entry If they qualified for the study, patients visited the treatment center 6 weeks before the start of insulin therapy. The purpose of the run-in period was to ensure that the patients were able to accurately perform home glucose monitoring and that patients who still responded to conventional therapy would not be unnecessarily treated with insulin. The patients were asked to measure their fasting blood glucose level daily and the diurnal blood glucose level weekly until the end of the first 3 months of insulin therapy and every other week thereafter. For the diurnal blood glucose level, measurements were taken before and 1.5 hours after breakfast, lunch and dinner; at 10 p.m.; and at 4 a.m. Patients were asked to record daily the occurrence of hypoglycemic symptoms. Fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, serum C-peptide, creatinine, and liver enzyme levels were measured, and the urinary albumin excretion rate was determined from collection of overnight urine. Three Weeks before Therapy Patient skills in home glucose monitoring and results from laboratory tests were checked. If they were acceptable, patient data were sent to the coordinating center for randomization. Randomization Patients were randomly assigned to four groups (Table) in four centers (six patients per group within each center) by using minimization of differences (calculated for the variables listed below) between the treatment groups (9). The following variables (relative weight of each variable is given in parentheses) were considered: age (1); sex (0.5); body mass index (1.5); duration of diabetes (0.5); fasting glucose level (2); fasting serum C-peptide level (1.0); use of diuretics or -blocking agents (0.25), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (0.25), or other drugs (0.25); and family history of hypertension (0.25). Table. Baseline Clinical and Biochemical Characteristics All patients in each group injected intermediate-acting neutral human isophane insulin, 100 IU/mL (Orion, Espoo, Finland), at 9 p.m. Additional therapy consisted of glyburide (Euglucon, Orion), 10.5 mg, given as one 3.5-mg tablet before breakfast and two 3.5-mg tablets before dinner plus four tablets (two before breakfast and two before dinner) of metformin placebo; metformin (Metforem, Orion), 2 g, given as two 500-mg tablets before breakfast and two 500-mg tablets before dinner, and three tablets (one before breakfast and two before dinner) of glyburide placebo; metformin, 2 g, and glyburide, 10.5 mg, given as described above; or a second injection of neutral human isophane insulin before breakfast. Thus, the trial was only partially blinded. Insulin was injected subcutaneously in the abdomen. Initiation of Insulin Therapy and Self-Adjustment of the Insulin Dose (0-Month Visit) A similar educational program was used in all participating centers. Insulin therapy was started if the fasting glucose level still exceeded 8 mmol/L (144 mg/dL). The initial bedtime insulin dosage (measured in IU/d) was equal to the fasting blood glucose level (measured in mmol/L). Patients were given written instructions for self-adjustment of the insulin dose: increase the dose by 4 IU/d if the fasting glucose level exceeds 8 mmol/L on three consecutive measurements and by 2 IU/d if the fasting glucose level exceeds 6 mmol/L (108 mg/dL) on three measurements. The goal was to decrease the fasting glucose level to less than 6 mmol/L, which was predicted to decrease the hemoglobin A1c value to less than 7.5% (6). Doses of oral agents remained the same. Before the start of insulin therapy, levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting serum free insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; waist-to-hip ratio (10); and blood pressure were measured. The patients were not instructed to change their diet (except for treatment of hypoglycemia) or exercise habits because of insulin therapy. Follow-up Visits Follow-up visits took place at 3 and 6 weeks and every 3 months for 1 year. At these visits, body weight, blood pressure, insulin dose, and side effects were recorded and fasting blood glucose was measured. Glycosylated hemoglobin was measured every 3 months. Measurements of serum C-peptide and lipids and waist-to-hip ratio were repeated at 12 months. Compliance, monitored through pill counting, was more than 95% for patients who completed the study. Analytical Methods Home blood glucose monitoring was performed by using the Hypocount Home Blood Glucose Monitor (Oriola, Espoo, Finland). Levels of serum free insulin (11), glycosylated hemoglobin (7), serum C-peptide (7), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (12), total cholesterol, and triglycerides (7) were measured as previously described. Liver enzyme, serum creatinine, and blood glucose levels were measured by using standard techniques at each local treatment center. Statistical Analysis Comparison of normally distributed variables between the groups (in patients who completed the trial) during the 12-month treatment period was performed by using analysis of variance for repeated measures. If analysis of variance for repeated measures had significant results, post hoc pairwise comparisons between the four groups were performed by using a Bonferroni correction. For comparison of means when the variance was not normally distributed (symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes), the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. The GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California) was used to fit data relating indices of glycemia to frequency of biochemical hypoglycemias by searching for the best fit among linear and various nonlinear regression models. Goodness of fit was evaluated by the runs test and the F test (GraphPad Software). Frequencies of hypoglycemia among the groups were compared by using the chi-square test. The data collected at 0 months were used as the baseline against which changes during insulin therapy were compared. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and all data are given as the mean SE. Role of the Funding Source Funding authorities had no role in the analysis or interpretation of the data or in the subsequent decision to submit the report for publication. Results Insulin Doses Initial doses of insulin were similar in all groups (Figure 1). After 12 months, the dosages of bedtime insulin were 24 3 IU/d in patients receiving bedtime insulin plus glyburide, 36 9 IU/d in patients receiving bedtime insulin plus metformin (P<0.01 compared with all other groups), 20 3 IU/d in patients receiving bedtime insulin plus both oral drugs, and 24 3 IU/d in patients receiving bedtime and morning insulin.

The reductions in HbA(1c) were similar in the nateglinide (0.6%) and troglitazone (0.8%) monotherapy groups. The reduction in HbA(1c) (1.7%) was greatest in the combination group; 79% of patients in the combination group achieved HbA(1c) levels of <7%.

This review provides a comprehensive summary of available data on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety profile of glimepiride in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It also examines the use of glimepiride to achieve and maintain good glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in current clinical practice. Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE for English-language studies published from 1990 to 2002. The search terms used were glimepiride, sulfonylureas, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The manufacturer of glimepiride provided additional information. Glimepiride differs from other SUs in a number of respects. In clinical studies, glimepiride was generally associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and less weight gain than other SUs. Results of other studies suggest that glimepiride can be used in older patients and those with renal compromise. There is evidence that glimepiride preserves myocardial preconditioning, a protective mechanism that limits damage in the event of an ischemic event. Glimepiride can be used in combination with other oral antidiabetic agents or insulin to optimize glycemic control. Based on the evidence to date, glimepiride is an effective and well-tolerated once-daily antidiabetic drug and provides an important treatment option for the management of type 2 diabetes.", "outbound_citations": ["12401771", "12401758", "11757083", "11678974", "11425777", "11272181", "11232737", "11147570", "10938048", "11277315", "10491414", "10213347", "9988102", "9793597", "9653594", "9561992", "9314626", "9250229", "9184703", "8960852", "8911979", "8911985", "8911975", "8911977", "8911982", "8864639", "8864640", "8864636", "8864638", "8911987", "7587918", "8529507", "8172913", "8172912", "1600834", "1908354", "2361988", "2664520", "6310409", "4926376"], "inbound_citations": ["36375572", "36048002", "35651883", "33553033", "32782450", "32243966", "32240805", "31937146", "31704276", "31367778", "29853031", "29535952"], "label": "1"}

Recently, however, metformin has been approved for the treatment of NIDDM.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed two large, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, controlled studies in which metformin or another treatment was given for 29 weeks to moderately obese patients with NIDDM whose diabetes was inadequately controlled by diet (protocol 1: metformin vs. placebo; 289 patients), or diet plus glyburide (protocol 2: metformin and glyburide vs. metformin vs. glyburide; 632 patients). To determine efficacy we measured plasma glucose (while the patients were fasting and after the oral administration of glucose), lactate, lipids, insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin before, during, and at the end of the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn protocol 1, at the end of the study the 143 patients in the metformin group, as compared with the 146 patients in the placebo group, had lower mean (+/- SE) fasting plasma glucose concentrations (189 +/- 5 vs. 244 +/- 6 mg per deciliter [10.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 13.7 +/- 0.3 mmol per liter], P < 0.001) and glycosylated hemoglobin values (7.1 +/- 0.1 percent vs. 8.6 +/- 0.2 percent, P < 0.001). In protocol 2, the 213 patients given metformin and glyburide, as compared with the 210 patients treated with glyburide alone, had lower mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations (187 +/- 4 vs. 261 +/- 4 mg per deciliter [10.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 14.6 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter], P < 0.001) and glycosylated hemoglobin values (7.1 +/- 0.1 percent vs. 8.7 +/- 0.1 percent, P < 0.001). The effect of metformin alone was similar to that of glyburide alone. Eighteen percent of the patients given metformin and glyburide had symptoms compatible with hypoglycemia, as compared with 3 percent in the glyburide group and 2 percent in the metformin group. In both protocols the patients given metformin had statistically significant decreases in plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, whereas the values in the respective control groups did not change. There were no significant changes in fasting plasma lactate concentrations in any of the groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMetformin monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin and sulfonylurea are well tolerated and improve glycemic control and lipid concentrations in patients with NIDDM whose diabetes is poorly controlled with diet or sulfonylurea therapy alone.", "outbound_citations": ["7859936", "8013758", "8412779", "8462390", "1600835", "1600834", "1569149", "1551495", "1532777", "1955512", "1900072", "2192847", "2162756", "2648723", "3058129", "3817306", "3552515", "3721064", "3935560", "3865878", "6367725", "6352352", "6847752", "7471394"], "inbound_citations": ["37187650", "37059405", "36961549", "36938239", "36830619", "36637190", "36814831", "36484892", "36272764", "36279989", "36289808", "36077136", "36034458", "35912631", "35955427", "35883888", "35775076", "35640743", "35481401", "35405248", "35401820", "35119068", "35056573", "34950736", "34922433", "34545025", "34420454", "34331316", "34285531", "34228650", "34200427", "33989756", "33650273", "33558906", "33562458", "33541707", "33491309", "33516224", "33510216", "33463546", "33489086", "33488106", "33331206", "33384765", "33312159", "33190640", "33168397", "32998798", "33178015", "32951009", "32936533", "32897388", "32910489", "33615200", "32845968", "32982969", "32936780", "32586469", "32521177", "32389830", "32333610", "32425881", "32240455", "32200500", "32140079", "32059692", "32435760", "31902433", "31922027", "31586319", "32010059", "31050706", "31886264", "31778746", "31653175", "31583436", "31534057", "31470636", "31339011", "31187887", "31255239", "30874963", "32351908", "30711436", "29032755", "30688410", "31435405", "30729102", "30604594", "33311036", "31326458", "30834844", "30060893", "30321183", "30317438", "30248910", "30008022", "29405635", "29887831", "29609531", "29227571", "29227578", "29858866", "29478240", "29605144", "29670840", "28857388", "28920861", "28610915", "28963752", "28417525", "29045765"], "label": "0"}

RESULTS Blood glucose levels during the first 5 h were significantly lowered not only by Gb but also by Ml and M2. The mean \u00b1 SE blood glucose reductions (versus placebo) expressed as percent of area under the curve (AUC) (0-5 h) were 18.2 \u00b1 3.3% for Ml, 12.5 \u00b1 2.3% forM2,19.9 \u00b1 2.1% for intravenous Gb, and 23.8 \u00b1 1.2% for Gb orally. Serum insulin levels were significantly increased by Gb as well as by Ml and M2.

Insulin sensitivity, pancreatic beta-cell function and surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk factors are significantly improved by rosiglitazone. Double-blind trials of 8 to 26 weeks of rosiglitazone 4 or 8 mg/day monotherapy indicate significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose (-2 to -3 mmol/L with 8 mg/day) and glycosylated haemoglobin levels [HbA(1c); -0.6 to -0.7% (-0.8 to -1.1% in drug-naive patients) with 8 mg/day]. Significant decreases in hyperglycaemic markers occurred when rosiglitazone was combined with metformin (HbA(1c) -0.8 to -1.0%), a sulphonylurea (-1.4%) or insulin (-1.2%) for 26 weeks versus little change with active comparator monotherapy. Efficacy was maintained in trials of < or = 2 years, and was also apparent in various ethnic subgroups, elderly patients, and both obese and nonobese patients. Rosiglitazone is currently not indicated in combination with injected insulin. It should be administered in conjunction with diet and exercise regimens. Rosiglitazone is generally well tolerated. Despite rare individual reports of liver function abnormalities in rosiglitazone recipients, the incidence of these in clinical trials (< or = 2 years' duration) was similar to that in placebo and active comparator groups. Fluid retention associated with rosiglitazone may be the cause of the increased incidence of anaemia in clinical trials, and also means that patients should be monitored for signs of heart failure during therapy. Although bodyweight is increased overall with rosiglitazone therapy, increases are in subcutaneous, not visceral, fat; hepatic fat is decreased. The pharmacokinetic profile of rosiglitazone is not substantially altered by age or renal impairment, nor are there important drug interactions. Rosiglitazone is not indicated in patients with active liver disease or increased liver enzymes. Oral rosiglitazone 4 or 8 mg/day provides significant antihyperglycaemic efficacy and is generally well tolerated, both as monotherapy and in combination with other antihyperglycaemic agents, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who do not have active liver disease. Long-term data are required before conclusions can be drawn about the clinical significance of positive changes to surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease risk and improvements to pancreatic beta-cell function. Rosiglitazone significantly improves insulin sensitivity and, as such, is a welcome addition to the treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.", "outbound_citations": ["12940867", "12173913", "12086760", "11978649", "11978674", "11919129", "11916933", "11903029", "11921435", "11994904", "11952022", "11872682", "15765617", "11793023", "11714655", "11705443", "11679440", "11574413", "11693184", "11522676", "11683857", "11423507", "11402638", "11360960", "11421562", "11334404", "11417440", "11344187", "11213884", "11197573", "11232013", "11503861", "11577798", "11185675", "11104782", "11086023", "11074926", "11075314", "10859151", "10849580", "10755495", "10821295", "10734046", "10768088", "10696077", "10644273", "10644281", "10644272", "10691158", "10659951", "10857389", "11033603", "10510156", "10622252", "12973417", "10602338", "10548525", "10579151", "10534139", "10479650", "10877745", "10683120", "10389852", "10392666", "11220295", "10332680", "10189566", "10189561", "10206085", "10227562", "10096775", "10820647", "10064098", "9843961", "9727886", "9703335", "9709924", "9588454", "9572887", "9568680", "9454824", "9538965", "9421389", "2721345", "9399962", "9421288", "9299560", "9258278", "9327774", "8954968", "8939934", "8824215", "8828476", "8770873", "8650171", "7657033", "7750898", "7926289", "8366922", "10400405", "10983737", "9742976", "9934490", "10510947", "11273100", "10725292", "11380072", "11135616", "9742972", "11685828", "9231657", "10454950", "10359389", "11149909", "10603986"], "inbound_citations": ["36575937", "36358965", "36270169", "36942599", "36052067", "35886989", "35203063", "35221947", "34453452", "33036752", "31538892", "31390199", "29058764"], "label": "0"}

AC2993 also promotes beta-cell proliferation and neogenesis in vitro and in animal models. This study examines the activity and safety of subcutaneously injected AC2993 in patients with type 2 diabetes currently treated with diet and/or oral antidiabetic agents (OAAs).\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nA total of 109 patients treated with diet and a sulfonylurea and/or metformin were enrolled in a blinded study. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three subcutaneously (SC) injected regimens of AC2993 (0.08 micro g/kg) or placebo for 28 days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll three AC2993 regimens led to significant reductions in serum fructosamine relative to placebo (P <or= 0.004). Mean reductions ranged from 39 to 46 micro mol/l. All AC2993 groups had reductions in HbA(1c) ranging from 0.7 to 1.1% (P <or= 0.006). An end-of-study HbA(1c) <7% was achieved by 15% of AC2993 patients versus 4% of placebo patients, confirming AC2993 effects on fasting and postprandial glycemia. On days 14 and 28, the beta-cell index (homeostasis model assessment) for patients treated with AC2993 was 50-100% higher than baseline, contrasting with unchanged levels for placebo. The most common adverse event was transient mild-to-moderate nausea.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAC2993 is a promising therapeutic for patients with type 2 diabetes. In this study, it had significant effects on HbA(1c) levels in patients not currently achieving optimal glucose control with diet and/or OAAs.", "outbound_citations": ["3899825", "12150359", "11978641", "11897280", "11889200", "11815505", "11790216", "11679485", "11423477", "11404233", "11319721", "11213895", "10830274", "10742535", "10605628", "10580413", "10491414", "10359389", "10331407", "10097918", "10027577", "9742976", "9669786", "9661618", "9203442", "9020121", "7589820", "8396143", "12502618", "3319291", "6825313"], "inbound_citations": ["36677809", "35080714", "34519400", "32955939", "32720500", "32500274", "32612869", "32008883", "31881271", "31901754", "31785258", "31688969", "31536476", "31077072", "30901912", "30772836", "28942790", "28543393", "28392300", "28115994", "27767249", "27896683", "26991522", "27486339", "26332080", "27519128", "26314515", "26428031", "26131320", "26106188", "25720388", "25375397", "25447052", "25311795", "24879836", "24989141", "24251641", "24549850", "24524730", "24370893", "24145815", "24396690", "23864651", "23707756", "23216746", "23748861", "23256660", "23122871", "22882281", "23164987", "23365557", "22945360", "22691625", "22884767", "22659620", "22233527", "22800369", "22825226", "22608106", "22266668", "22054347", "22357185", "22366643", "22171669", "22065862", "22225873", "22267302", "22365085", "22085180", "21323903", "21864750", "21362122", "24843529", "21548720", "21251180", "21450987", "20841306", "19834322", "21219119", "21307137", "22127767", "24843486", "21397776", "21142268", "20942513", "21029027", "20831513", "20856686", "20498254", "20616094", "20580422", "20686848", "20616619", "20631270", "20371755", "20215461", "19815053", "20082536", "19931305", "20109208", "19586609", "20056950", "20582183", "19706990", "19878257", "20003758", "19545590", "19876795", "19519868", "19748059", "19748064", "21437125", "19421968", "19383034", "19488823", "19446153", "18771570", "18804493", "18548352", "19011168", "18855890", "21437077", "19019476", "19194050", "19076063", "19047364", "30764058", "18782641", "18829977", "18628530", "18777488", "18774875", "18803987", "18542012", "18460557", "23496217", "18589167", "17994612", "18500913", "17490426", "18500914", "18054732", "17698900", "18205109", "17909374", "17705687", "17919559", "17940451", "17854513", "17631146", "17593272", "17619527", "17658012", "17498508", "17425627", "17417933", "17407648", "17407649", "17263764", "17283237", "17259389", "18220652", "17220786", "18473991", "17696568", "17379054", "16943856", "17160407", "18370749", "17109672", "17195423", "17090794", "16985091", "17007012", "17375403", "16919548", "16859392", "16788334", "16776749", "16800760", "16722815", "30764072", "16637784", "16637783", "16861088", "16202636", "16708716", "16712485", "16609877", "16629719", "17319471", "16517403", "16370928", "16447057", "16168640", "16313276", "16306561", "16271921", "16219012", "16144950", "16027230", "16230722", "16188169", "16277173", "16137221", "16100297", "15879053", "16120042", "16132964", "17491680", "15983224", "15780433", "16142014", "15929678", "16004598", "15896683", "15831781", "15855571", "15855572", "15759282", "15752927"], "label": "0"}

Therefore, we studied the effect of metformin on blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, and microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA clinical trial was designed in type 2 diabetic patients with incipient nephropathy. All patients were below the age of 65, normotensive, and without evidence of malignant, hepatic, or cardiovascular disorders. They were randomly allocated to receive glibenclamide or metformin. At baseline and 12 weeks thereafter we measured body mass index (BMI), serum insulin, blood glucose, lipid profile, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and urine albumin.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe studied 23 patients in the glibenclamide group and 28 in the metformin group. There was no difference in baseline variables between the groups. Metabolic control was obtained in both groups. In the metformin group, all the following variables decreased: microalbuminuria was reduced by a mean of 24.2 mg/day (p = 0.008); systolic and diastolic blood pressure by a mean of 5.3 mmHg (p = 0.002) and 3.93 mmHg (p = 0.009), respectively; insulin levels by an average of 11.8 microIU/mL (p = 0.001), and total cholesterol levels and triglycerides by an average of 0.45 and 0.18 mmol/L, respectively. Insulin resistance measured by the homeostasis model decreased more in the metformin group than in the glibenclamide group. Patients treated with glibenclamide had an increase in HDL cholesterol of 0.082 mmol/L (p = 0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMetformin significantly decreased the urine albumin excretion rate with none of the expected changes in renal hemodynamics, probably due to its favorable effects on blood pressure, lipid profile, metabolic control, and insulin resistance.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37071054", "33321755", "32545901", "32342619", "31342643", "30702162", "29435189", "26733332", "27214299", "26004378", "26727727", "24756098", "24241085", "24432311", "22801248", "22312141", "22313233", "21942305", "21454723", "21282369", "19131464", "18426821", "18257780", "16437448"], "label": "0"}

MAT was repeated after 6 months of treatment. Both treatments reduced glucose equally (-1.7 mmol/L for troglitazone and -1.5 mmol/L for glyburide), but only troglitazone reduced insulin (-15 microU/mL; P<0.001) and C-peptide (-0.9 ng/mL; P<0.02) levels. Troglitazone significantly reduced BP at baseline (P<0.05) and systolic BP response to MAT (P<0.01), whereas glyburide did not affect BP at baseline or during MAT. Stroke volume and cardiac output did not change with either drug, but troglitazone decreased peripheral vascular resistance (-112 dyne. s. cm(-5); P<0.05). Improved insulin resistance rather than an improved glycemic control is associated with lower resting and stress BP values in patients with DM.

Plasma insulin concentrations were always increased by glibenclamide, and they were lowered identically by exercise with and without glibenclamide. However, throughout exercise, absolute concentrations of insulin were lower on days without glibenclamide compared with days with glibenclamide (34.5 +/- 4.7 vs. 47.4 +/- 5.5 pmol/l; P < 0.05). At the start of exercise, glucose concentrations were similar between experiments (P > 0.05). The rate of decrease in glucose during exercise was higher (P < 0.05) on days with both glibenclamide and exercise, compared with days with glibenclamide alone and days with exercise alone (-0.035 +/- 0.009 vs. -0.016 +/- 0.002 and -0.022 +/- 0.005 mmol.l-1.min-1, respectively). Consequently, the glucose nadir was lower on days with glibenclamide and exercise than on days with glibenclamide or exercise alone (6.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 8.1 +/- 0.9 and 7.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/l, respectively; P < 0.05). During exercise, the rate of appearance of plasma glucose determined by 3-[3H]glucose infusion was lower on days with glibenclamide than on days without glibenclamide (2.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.1 mg.min-1.kg-1; P < 0.05). In contrast, glucose clearance was identical (P > 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn postabsorptive type 2 diabetic patients, the hypoglycemic action of glibenclamide and exercise is enhanced when the treatments are combined.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug in preventing ventricular fibrillation in diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction. Methods: We studied 232 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (106 on glibenclamide, group Al; 126 treated with another hypoglycemic drug or with diet only, group A2) and 830 non-diabetic people. All the patients were admitted to our coronary care unit with their first myocardial infarction. Results: Ventricular fibrillation occurred in 1.9% of group Al, 7.9% of group A2, and 9.9% of the non-diabetic (Al versus A2, P < 0.05; A2 versus the non-diabetic group, NS; Al versus the non-diabetic group, P < 0.01). Sustained ventricular tachycardia was not significantly different among the groups. Conclusions: The antiarrhythmic effectiveness of glibenclamide might be related to its blocking action on the ATP-dependent potassium channel, with consequent attenuation of the efflux of potassium induced by ischemia. We also observed a higher mortality rate resulting from heart failure in group A2 than in group Al or the non-diabetic group. Since glibenclamide has never shown significant effects on myocardial contractility, this finding remains to be elucidated. Glibenclamide therefore appears to have an antifibrillatory effect in acute myocardial infarction; with respect to acute coronary events, the drug might be able to prevent ventricular fibrillation, which is most often fatal when it occurs before hospitalization.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35238022", "33896015", "29437823"], "label": "0"}

Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a global disease affecting all ethnic groups. There are ethnic differences in both the prevalence and metabolic characteristics of the disease. Important interethnic pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences have been reported for several drugs. With few exceptions, detailed studies on sulphonylurea are lacking. The patients were studied on two occasions when either no Gb (control) or 1.25 mg Gb was administered i.v., immediately before the administration of a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Concentrations of insulin and proinsulin were determined by means of radioimmunoassay without cross-reactivities. Gb concentration was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacodynamic results were calculated using net areas under the curves, with basal values set as zero. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. When glucose was administered orally without Gb, Chinese patients had higher plasma glucose increases at 10 min (7.6 mmol/l x min vs 2.6 mmol/l x min) and higher increases of plasma insulin levels than Caucasians at both 10 min (198 pmol/l x min vs 54 pmol/l x min) and 30 min (2286 pmol/l x min vs 1198 pmol/l x min). When Gb was administered, the plasma glucose increases were reduced, and the increases of serum insulin and proinsulin levels were greater in both ethnic groups. Compared with the basal values (-1 min), proinsulin/insulin ratios (RPI) were lowest at 10-30 min, followed by an increase. Chinese patients had higher increases of serum insulin levels at 10 min (1109 pmol/l x min vs 550 pmol/l x min) and a lower RPI at 30 min (6. 0% vs 7.6%) and 240 min (15.0% vs 21.0%) relative to Caucasians. Serum Gb data were best fitted to a biexponential i.v. model. There were no interethnic differences in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters. In summary, following oral glucose administration without Gb, Chinese type-2 diabetic patients had higher plasma insulin levels but also higher plasma glucose levels during the first 10 min, which might reflect reduced insulin sensitivity or more rapid glucose absorption. Gb augmented glucose-induced release of both insulin and proinsulin in both ethnic groups; the effect on insulin secretion was more pronounced. In conclusion, minor pharmacodynamic but no pharmacokinetic differences were found between the two groups. It seems appropriate to employ the same dosage principles when using Gb in Caucasians and Chinese.", "outbound_citations": ["9715377", "9313749", "8784086", "8894472", "8825191", "8591697", "8033529", "7955993", "1425100", "1516487", "1737539", "1954808", "1879095", "1907291", "2121211", "2369804", "2758729", "2536896", "2493353", "3933658", "6759080", "736028", "343587", "5052977"], "inbound_citations": ["32403034", "30569284", "29762878", "28887366"], "label": "1"}

No further gliclazide was given over the next 48 h. Regular blood samples were drawn for serum glucose, insulin and gliclazide assay. Gliclazide was measured using h.p.l.c. Noncompartmental analysis was used to describe primary data. A multicompartment model incorporating entero-hepatic recirculation was fitted to group mean serum gliclazide profiles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe Caucasians were older than the Aborigines (mean +/- s.d. age 53.4 +/- 12.2 vs 40.3 +/- 6.9 years, P < 0.05) but had similar diabetes duration, body mass index and glycated haemoglobin. Noncompartmental analysis revealed no between-group differences in gliclazide kinetics. Post-breakfast serum glucose and insulin responses were also similar apart from a longer time to maximum concentration (tmax) for glucose amongst the Aborigines (2.6 +/- 0.4 vs 2.2 +/- 0. 3 h in Caucasians; P = 0.024). Gliclazide tmax exhibited a skewed unimodal distribution and was not associated with gliclazide maximum concentration, or glucose or insulin responses. Most patients had a serum gliclazide profile suggestive of enterohepatic recirculation and/or biphasic absorption. Model-derived estimates of the extent of putative enterohepatic recirculation were 30% and 20% of dose in Caucasians and Aborigines, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGliclazide is equally effective in Caucasian and Aboriginal diabetic patients.

These data suggest that nateglinide is suitable for use in diabetic patients with IRF or with renal failure undergoing dialysis. Given the comparable absorption and elimination profiles of nateglinide in renally impaired and healthy subjects, no dose adjustment appears necessary in the renally impaired.", "outbound_citations": ["11259325", "11417447", "11194245", "10692277", "10784228", "10868832", "11563410", "10205355", "9742976", "9653599", "9551701", "9146849", "8853933", "7587846", "7810517", "7988301", "1462984", "3184351"], "inbound_citations": ["33275653", "29667921"], "label": "0"}

In order to evaluate whether Lp(a), a lipoprotein that is potentially thrombogenic and atherogenic, is a potential risk factor for CAD in non\u2010insulin\u2010dependent diabetes (NIDDM), we compared the Lp(a) and its distribution in 145 NIDDM patients with that in 94 healthy control subjects. Furthermore, we studied the effect of insulin treatment on serum Lp(a) in 108 patients with NIDDM. Male and female NIDDM patients had similar Lp(a) concentrations to healthy controls (median value 167 mg L\u20101, range 15\u20131550 mg L\u20101 vs. 157 mg L\u20101, range 15\u2013919 mg L\u20101, NS and 92, range 15\u20131190 mg L\u20101 vs. 103 mg L\u20101, range 15\u2013842 mg L\u20101, NS). Also, the cumulative distribution of Lp(a) did not differ between the NIDDM patients and healthy subjects. Insulin treatment increased Lp(a) in diabetics with a Lp(a) concentration of less than 300 mg \u20101L, but this effect was not related to the concomitant improvement in metabolic control (mean change (\u00b1SEM) of HbA1c from 9.80\u00b10.15 to 8.00\u00b10.12; P < 0.001). In subjects with elevated Lp(a) concentrations (>300 mg L\u20101) the Lp(a) concentration was unaffected by insulin, despite a similar improvement in glycaemic control.

In 1987, the islet amyloid precursor polypeptide (IAPP) amylin (a 37 amino acid) was discovered. Recently there has been an explosion of amylin's importance in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This review is intended to share what is understood about amylin derived amyloid and the role it plays in T2DM. Whether islet amyloid is an epiphenomenona, a tombstone, or a trigger it leaves an indelible footprint in greater that 70% of the patients with T2DM. There is current data supporting the damaging role of intermediate sized toxic amyloid particles to the beta cell resulting in a beta cell defect which contributes to a relative deficiency or loss of insulin secretion. Within the islet there is an intense redox stress which may be associated with the unfolding of amylin's native secondary structure compounding its amyloidogenic properties. In addition to the beta cell defect there may be an absorptive defect as a result of amyloid deposition in the basement membranes which form an envelope around the inta-islet capillary endothelium. We have an opportunity to change our current treatment modalities with newer medications and we should attempt to diagnose T2DM earlier and use these newer treatment strategies in combination to decrease glucotoxicity without elevating endogenous insulin and amylin.

Three study conditions were administered in random order on separate mornings: 1) no premeal diabetes medication, 2) insulin lispro, 0.1 unit/kg body wt premeal and 3) repaglinide 1 mg premeal. Glucose and insulin levels were measured every 20 min for 5 h.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFasting insulin and glucose levels were normal in patients with CFRD, but the peak glucose level was elevated. Insulin lispro significantly decreased the peak glucose level (P = 0.0004) and the 2-h (P = 0.001) and 5-h (P < 0.0001) glucose area under the curve (AUC). Repaglinide significantly decreased the 5-h glucose AUC (P = 0.03). Neither drug completely normalized cystic fibrosis glucose excursion at the doses used for this study. Insulin lispro significantly increased the 5-h insulin AUC (P = 0.04).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn response to subcutaneous insulin lispro, postprandial glucose excursion was significantly diminished and insulin secretion was enhanced compared with a control meal in which no medication was given to patients with CFRD. The oral agent repaglinide resulted in lesser corrections in these parameters.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This multicenter randomized open-controlled trial was conducted in outpatient diabetes clinics in 15 U.K. hospitals. A total of 591 subjects who had already been randomly allocated to sulfonylurea therapy were taking maximum doses with suboptimal glycemic control, i.e., raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of 6\u221215 mmol/l but no significant hyperglycemic symptoms. The main outcome measures included FPG, glycated hemoglobin, protocol-defined marked hyperglycemia, body weight, blood pressure, fasting plasma lipids, compliance, and hypoglycemia and other side effects. RESULTS After the addition of metformin, FPG concentrations decreased by mean (95% CI) \u22120.47 (\u22120.82 to \u22120.13) mmol/l over 3 years compared with an increase of 0.44 (0.07\u22120.81) mmol/l in subjects on sulfonylurea alone (P < 0.00001). Median FPG concentrations at 3 years were 8.6 vs. 9.9 mmol/l, respectively (P < 0.00001), and HbA1c values were 7.5 and 8.1%, respectively (P = 0.006). Adjustment for baseline BMI or FPG concentration did not affect response to therapy. Only 7% of those allocated to sulfonylurea plus metformin developed protocol-defined marked hyperglycemia compared with 36% of those allocated to sulfonylurea alone (P < 0.0001). Fasting plasma lipids, body weight, and blood pressure did not change significantly. The incidence of hypoglycemic episodes did not differ between groups: 4% on sulfonylurea plus metformin and 2% on sulfonylurea alone (NS).

In phase IV (6 months), 25 of the 30 original subjects received open-labeled, high-dose BI-DSU. Low-dose BI-DSU markedly reduced FPG (13.6 \u00b1 0.8 to 8.0 \u00b1 0.6 mmol/1, P < 0.001), mean 24-h glucose (P < 0.001), HbA1c (8.9 \u00b1 0.7 to 7.6 \u00b1 0.3%, P = 0.07), and basal hepatic glucose production (HGP) (P < 0.005). A positive correlation (r = 0.69, P < 0.05) between the declines in FPG and HGP was observed. Neither low-dose BI alone nor DSU alone reduced FPG, mean 24-h glucose, HbA1c, or basal HGP. High-dose (40 \u00b1 5 U/day) BI plus DSU further reduced the FPG (6.3 \u00b1 0.6 mmoM), HbA1c (7.1 \u00b1 0.3%), mean 24-h plasma glucose, and basal HGP (all P < 0.05 vs. phase II). High-dose BI alone (38 \u00b1 4 U/day) improved FPG (P < 0.01 vs. phase II), mean 24-h plasma glucose (P < 0.005 vs. phase II), HbA1c (P < 0.05 vs. phase II), and basal HGP (P < 0.05 vs. phase I) to a degree similar to low-dose BI-DSU but less than high-dose BI-DSU. Regardless of prior treatment, FPG and HbA1c were controlled during phase IV. Weight gain during BI-DSU was largely attributable to reduced glucosuria. In conclusion, 1) both BI-DSU and BI alone improve glycemia in SU failure patients; 2) BI-DSU is superior to BI alone during both low- and high-dose BI; 3) the efficacy of BI is related to its suppression of basal HGP; and 4) good long-term glycemie control (up to 12 months) can be achieved with combined BI-DSU therapy.", "outbound_citations": ["8325203", "1406860", "1516500", "1600834", "1499466", "1499473", "1595776", "1532777", "1661655", "1809598", "1936482", "2044434", "1985114", "2192848", "2180312", "2505990", "2653929", "2657323", "3069401", "3292322", "3275857", "3100365", "3516607", "3908026", "3888568", "3882489", "2857269", "6376219", "6629834", "7287908", "382871", "88281", "862204", "985402", "13833973"], "inbound_citations": ["32920595", "30132034", "30008760", "28509408"], "label": "1"}

Each monotherapy could be succeeded by add-on treatments. The model included the costs of routine medical care and supplies, medication, adverse events, and treatment failures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing a Monte Carlo simulation, the mean 3-year cumulative costs per patient were $4971, $5273, and $5311 for glipizide GITS, metformin, and acarbose first-line strategies, respectively. The main cost drivers were drug prices. Mean 3-year cost savings for first-line glipizide GITS were $301 over metformin and $340 over acarbose. Between 83% and 85% of all simulations showed cost savings with glipizide GITS compared with the other agents.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe model suggests first-line monotherapy with glipizide GITS should result in desirable short-term economic benefits for managed care. Because the model incorporates recommended glycemic goals and performed well in sensitivity analyses, it should be applicable to a variety of clinical practices and useful for economic assessments of new therapies.

Thiazolidinediones, more commonly termed glitazones, are the first drugs to specifically target muscular insulin resistance. They have proven efficacy for reducing plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with diet alone, sulphonylureas, metformin or insulin. In addition, they are associated with some improvement of the cardiovascular risk profile. However, troglitazone, the first compound approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US, proved to be hepatotoxic and was withdrawn from the market after the report of several dozen deaths or cases of severe hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation. It remains unclear whether or not hepatotoxicity is a class effect or is related to unique properties of troglitazone. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, two other glitazones, appear to have similar efficacy with regard to blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as compared with troglitazone. In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of significant (> or =3 x upper limit of normal) increases in liver enzyme levels (ALT in particular) was similar with rosiglitazone or pioglitazone as compared with placebo, whereas troglitazone was associated with a 3-fold greater incidence. In contrast to the numerous case reports of acute liver failure in patients receiving troglitzone, only a few case reports of hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients treated with rosiglitazone until now, with a causal relationship remaining uncertain. Furthermore, no single case of severe hepatotoxicity has been reported yet with pioglitazone. It should be mentioned that troglitazone, unlike pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, induces the cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4, which is partly responsible for its metabolism, and may be prone to drug interactions. Importantly enough, obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus are associated with liver abnormalities, especially non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, independent of any pharmacological treatment. This association obviously complicates the selection of patients who are good candidates for a treatment with glitazones as well as the monitoring of liver tests after initiation of therapy with any thiazolidinedione compound. While regular monitoring of liver enzymes is still recommended and more long term data are desirable, current evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing experience in the US supports the conclusion that rosiglitazone and pioglitazone do not share the hepatotoxic profile of troglitazone.", "outbound_citations": ["9279500", "14626263", "12481655", "11497537", "11410214", "11431595", "11283870", "11321935", "11179459", "11213855", "11170509", "11192132", "11074925", "11063962", "11092281", "11391549", "11106100", "11110228", "10997939", "10979889", "10929166", "10930382", "10915108", "10903299", "10859151", "10902968", "10766693", "10755495", "10804323", "10821295", "10768450", "10768088", "10685643", "10707561", "10685776", "10644273", "10644281", "10644272", "10691167", "10691158", "10752642", "10659951", "10638596", "10510156", "10587844", "10535741", "10534310", "10497147", "10480527", "10496299", "10480795", "10431549", "10348825", "11220295", "10227562", "10193691", "9918906", "10068372", "9867776", "9839107", "9753210", "9765002", "9727881", "9652997", "9652998", "9638389", "9588250", "9568680", "9516229", "9518284", "9533065", "9469685", "9437272", "9429837", "9505997", "15989661", "9196046", "9195388", "9211562", "9150855", "9067328", "9204412", "8922349", "8581074", "8129864", "2227807", "2220728", "2254635", "3199264", "3885402", "6734394", "4908707", "14795025", "10400405", "9211083", "9832300", "11159615", "10068399", "10795774", "11033586", "10983737", "9005748", "11129120", "9506242", "10954962", "10732419", "11033603", "10422202", "10749332", "11965828", "10688239", "9314015", "11258040", "10975209", "11232700", "7565951", "10695637"], "inbound_citations": ["36565754", "35535116", "34165671", "32028848", "32033735", "31532188", "31531370", "31294483", "31340601", "30263952", "30148106", "29913214", "29551531"], "label": "0"}

We assessed the effects of treatment with glibenclamide or insulin on the extension of left ventricular myocardial dysfunction induced by acute ischemia. Nineteen consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease entered the study. Each patient was randomly assigned to either insulin or glibenclamide therapy. Treatment was crossed over after 12 weeks and maintained for another 12 weeks. At the end of each treatment, left ventricular myocardial function at rest and during dipyridamole infusion was studied by two-dimensional echocardiography under the same conditions of metabolic control. Glibenclamide or insulin treatment did not influence the rest values of left ventricular dimensions, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), or wall motion score index (WMSI). Dipyridamole infusion, in patients receiving glibenclamide treatment, decreased LVEF (43 +/- 7 vs. 37 +/- 12%, P < 0.005) and increased WMSI (1.4 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.98 +/- 0.24, P < 0.001) compared with baseline values; during insulin treatment, LVEF (46 +/- 8 vs. 45 +/- 11%, NS) and WMSI (1.4 +/- 0.29 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.4, NS) did not change significantly. Peak stress LVEF was higher (45 +/- 11 vs. 37 +/- 12%, P < 0.001) and WMSI lower (1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.98 +/- 0.24, P < 0.001) in patients receiving insulin. The results indicate that in patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease, ischemic myocardial dysfunction induced by dipyridamole infusion is less severe during treatment with insulin than with glibenclamide. Restitution of a preconditioning mechanism in insulin-treated patients may be the potential beneficial mechanism.", "outbound_citations": ["7646421", "8270133", "11153727", "11073879", "10908220", "11220526", "10955370", "10391275", "10190876", "9935017", "9742977", "9669263", "9502657", "9462586", "9421384", "9236412", "8914868", "8901685", "8873655", "8772740", "7594031", "7573382", "7850985", "7930208", "8181153", "8498380", "8450161", "8432214", "1482696", "1555269", "1856416", "2242528", "2333960", "2698218", "2961993", "3769170", "7371124", "487544", "13766421"], "inbound_citations": ["36261824", "36205446", "34054542", "32564335", "32811736", "32202061", "31969144", "30876392", "29368701", "28523719", "28526186", "27862902", "27268470", "27038847", "25150157", "23594109", "23394462", "22411425", "22118706", "15200348", "20066963", "19729596", "19761101", "19363132", "18977481", "18564176", "19077788", "18825491", "17512619", "18333890", "18227473", "18175092", "17927975", "17961296", "18048761", "17594390", "16634115", "16750735", "16631807", "16415463", "16287756", "16163910", "16013692", "16186639", "15386810"], "label": "0"}

Plasma glucose, insulin, intact and 32/33 split proinsulin were measured at diagnostic OGTT. After 8\u201312 weeks on a conventional diet, subjects with a fasting glucose > 9 mmol I\u22121 (n = 12) were commenced on sulphonylurea therapy. At diagnosis, the sulphonylurea requiring group were more hyperglycaemic (p < 0.0001), less obese (p<0.05) and more insulin deficient with a lower 30 min insulin (p < 0.0002) than the diet group. Following dietary intervention in the sulphonylurea group, weight remained unchanged but there was a reduction in fasting glucose (p < 0.009). Fasting insulin, intact proinsulin, and 32/33 split proinsulin remained unchanged. After 12 weeks of sulphonylurea therapy there was a weight gain of 1.5 kg (p < 0.01), but a reduction in fasting glucose (p < 0.0001). Fasting insulin and intact proinsulin increased (p < 0.004) but 32/33 split proinsulin remained unchanged. There was a significant increase in both the fasting insulin to glucose ratio (p < 0.005), and the intact to 32/33 split proinsulin ratio (p < 0.02). Final fasting glucose following sulphonylurea therapy was positively correlated with the initial intact and 32/33 split proinsulin and the fasting glucose following dietary treatment. It is clear from this work that sulphonylureas have a complex effect on beta cell physiology and as well as stimulating release of insulin they increase the release of intact proinsulin but not that of 32/33 split proinsulin, hence they increase the intact to 32/33 split proinsulin ratio.", "outbound_citations": ["8508612", "8508611", "8440711", "1429623", "1600834", "1516487", "1727062", "1912918", "1860012", "2226325", "2186054", "2669734", "2563455", "2644145", "4055768", "111449", "343587", "5052977", "4868334"], "inbound_citations": ["24969577", "21722594", "20679359", "20615100", "17174222", "15929679"], "label": "0"}
