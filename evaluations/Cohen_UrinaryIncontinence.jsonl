In terms of study design, volunteers randomly received oral tolterodine L-tartrate (2 mg twice daily) or matching placebo for 7 days, with a single oral dose of warfarin (25 mg) administered on day 4 of each treatment period. R-(+)- and S-(-)-warfarin pharmacokinetics were estimated from plasma levels measured up to 96 h post-dose, in conjunction with assessment of prothrombin time and factor VII activity. Pharmacokinetics of tolterodine and its active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite ((R)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-phenyl)-3-phenylpropanamine; 5-HM), in the presence and absence of warfarin, were also determined. Relative to placebo, tolterodine had no discernible effect on the anticoagulant actions of warfarin. Point estimates of the tolterodine:placebo ratios for prothrombin time and factor VII activity were 1.00 (90 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.91-1.10) and 0.91 (90 % CI: 0.83-0.99), respectively, consistent with equivalence. No clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of R-(+)- and S-(-)-warfarin were noted.

These bioavailability differences change the efficacy and tolerability of this drug class, which consistently enhances patient compliance and overall drug effect. In order for drug delivery to alter successfully the bioavailability of a specific agent, the metabolism of that agent and the effect of the degradatory pathway on drug-parent compound levels need to be established. This will enable researchers to design improved or altered delivery pathways to maximize the benefits of these agents. Intestinal metabolism is known to affect certain agents, specifically oxybutynin chloride. Therefore, delivery techniques have been designed that either substantially lower or totally bypass intestinal (presystemic) metabolism. These alternate paths include extended-release oral, cutaneous, intravesical, and intravaginal routes. In addition, improvements in drug delivery have also been found to influence positively efficacy and tolerability profiles associated with tolterodine tartrate, another anticholinergic agent. A long-acting oral formulation has been shown to increase drug efficacy while decreasing tolerability concerns and side effects such as xerostomia. These salubrious effects are, in part, due to the more stable serum-drug concentrations that are imparted by this long-acting formulation.", "outbound_citations": ["11496941", "3234461", "12131314", "11678784", "11435842", "11394733", "11322350", "11248608", "11210400", "10775736", "10332441", "10391673", "10073329", "9720583", "9775412", "9072550", "8575504", "2566693", "10475346", "12001823"], "inbound_citations": ["28930605", "29111098", "25316768"], "label": "0"}

Extended-release formulations of oxybutynin at 10 mg/d or tolterodine at 4 mg/d were given for 12 weeks to women with 21 to 60 urge urinary incontinence (UUI) episodes per week and an average of 10 or more voids per 24 hours. Episodes of UUI (primary end point), total (urge and nonurge) incontinence, and micturition were recorded in 24-hour urinary diaries at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 and compared. Adverse events were also evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nImprovements in weekly UUI episodes were similar for the 790 women who received extended-release formulations of oxybutynin (n = 391) or tolterodine (n = 399). Oxybutynin was significantly more effective than tolterodine in reducing micturition frequency (P = .003), and 23.0% of women taking oxybutynin reported no episodes of urinary incontinence compared with 16.8% of women taking tolterodine (P = .03). Dry mouth, usually mild, was more common with oxybutynin (P = .02). Adverse events were generally mild and occurred at low rates, with both groups having similar discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nReductions in weekly UUI and total incontinence episodes were similar with extended-release formulations of oxybutynin and tolterodine. In the oxybutynin group, micturition frequency was significantly lower, and the percentage of women reporting no urinary incontinence episodes was significantly higher compared with the tolterodine group. Dry mouth was more common with oxybutynin, but tolerability was otherwise comparable, including adverse events involving the central nervous system.", "outbound_citations": ["9745968", "12114892", "12028164", "11530119", "11402632", "11322350", "11248608", "11327200", "11183900", "11183901", "10775736", "10543335", "10379745", "10332441", "10711115", "10073329", "9929859", "9510336", "9467475", "9776013", "2179368"], "inbound_citations": ["34486168", "33592680", "32500759", "32457631", "31449805", "31793816", "31346670", "31066800", "30105455", "29692690", "29282013", "29159581", "28378881", "28489120", "28008590", "26340514", "27377941", "27176185", "26800277", "27176184", "26476110", "25861957", "26149965", "26000514", "25369726", "25725183", "25348235", "25222388", "25196247", "24703195", "24971138", "24803217", "24231837", "24275310", "24601811", "24373019", "23639715", "23692526", "23395402", "26663241", "22976530", "23086134", "22396371", "22999811", "23098785", "22871042", "23089342", "22998646", "22910177", "22777274", "22711079", "22876096", "22536472", "22453185", "22197347", "22258963", "22344568", "22761613", "22046182", "22237808", "21830836", "21639723", "21687579", "20860717", "21489081", "21299469", "21468740", "21984774", "21373193", "24198627", "20127839", "21116359", "20590605", "20384545", "20877608", "20171677", "20097022", "20187733", "24198609"], "label": "0"}

In fact nocturnal enuresis delays early autonomy and socialisation by decreasing in self-esteem and self-confidence. Nocturnal enuresis classification is the preliminary step to correct therapy. Enuresis must be classified as primary (never acquired nocturnal control) or secondary (at least 6 months of dry nights). A child is also classified as having monosymptomatic enuresis if she/he experienced only night wetting and symptomatic enuresis if she/he experienced night wetting associated with diurnal voiding symptoms (urinated > or = 7 times a day, urgency, damp pants, squatting, holding the perineum, sitting on one heel). Monosymptomatic patients must be treated with desmopressin nasal spray at the daily dose of 20 micrograms at bed time. If the reduction of at least the 50% of the basal number of the wet nights is not achieved, the dosage must be increased until 40 micrograms. For patients affected by rhinitis or asthma, desmopressin is now available in tablets. In symptomatic patients desmopressin therapy must be associated to oxybutinin (5 mg x 2). Therapy interruption must be gradual with desmopressin reduction of 10 micrograms every 30 days. In symptomatic patients oxybutinin must be introduced only at bed time. The efficacy of the drugs depends on the therapy length. The highest percentage of success is obtained if the treatment is protracted for at least six months. Antidepressants are also used for nocturnal enuresis especially imipramine. The dosage varies between 0.5-1.5 mg/ kg/daily. As plasmatic levels are achieved only in 30% of treated patients, a 3-5 fold increase in suggested. Nevertheless these levels result in near toxic threshold concentration. Sporadic treatment purposes include amytriptiline, diclofenac sodicum, viloxsazine and methilphenidate if giggle incontinence is present. Non responders may be treated with alarm. If after 16 weeks of treatment no success is obtained alarm use must be interrupted.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Using the expert panel's classifications, about 2.6% of elderly patients (95% CI, 2.0%-3.2%) used at least 1 of the 11 medications that should always be avoided by elderly patients; 9.1% (95% CI, 7.9%-10.3%) used at least 1 of the 8 that would rarely be appropriate; and 13.3% (95% CI, 11.7%-14.9%) used at least 1 of the 14 medications that have some indications but are often misused. Use of some inappropriate medications declined between 1987 and 1996. Persons with poor health and more prescriptions had a significantly higher risk of inappropriate medication use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOverall inappropriate medication use in elderly patients remains a serious problem. Despite challenges in using explicit criteria for assessing inappropriate medications for elderly patients, such criteria can be applied to population-based surveys to identify opportunities to improve quality of care and patient safety. Enhancements of existing data sources to include dosage, duration, and indication may augment national improvement and monitoring efforts.", "outbound_citations": ["11207875", "11025793", "11025781", "11028246", "10983906", "10718022", "10443855", "10096703", "9786375", "9456428", "9236554", "9220038", "9096541", "9033421", "7730533", "8028148", "8028142", "8447707", "1308759", "1514459", "1888249", "6147611", "6103676"], "inbound_citations": ["37277240", "36968816", "36877279", "36498125", "35309155", "35025135", "34802959", "34894833", "34517775", "34321124", "34211269", "36098136", "33964882", "33530943", "33413494", "32605319", "32561466", "32462298", "32459845", "32373430", "31856780", "31570516", "31389566", "31226874", "31160274", "30746726", "31214031", "31125358", "30952819", "31601189", "30003664", "30291747", "30233194", "30122212", "29641617", "29618951", "29457258", "29589066", "28851511", "29350335", "29138901", "29201368", "28224699", "28905162", "28764876", "28399319", "29156868", "27489036", "27686781", "28284416", "28448781", "28212616", "28087585", "27451330", "27999470", "27382265", "27354917", "26175537", "27151653", "27130965", "26884392", "26129701", "26712428", "26689669", "26529442", "26418380", "26450144", "27747571", "26200069", "25702921", "27747568", "25979776", "26165873", "26096393", "25967399", "25855518", "25682702", "25646290", "25733718", "25752646", "25598449", "26653693", "25502492", "25538464", "25453732", "25293516", "25413197", "24963101", "25347192", "25041361", "25002159", "24824884", "24919523", "24576251", "24530281", "24489461", "23610232", "24362845", "24246485", "24219201", "24523777", "23550814", "24346667", "23818773", "23129159", "23514019", "23516122", "23414637", "23551647", "22959146", "23266529", "24019054", "23090702", "23047791", "23047789", "23088742", "23351226", "23461086", "22778146", "23047243", "22983875", "22204669", "22830533", "22683399", "22239067", "22711452", "22788395", "22788396", "22642779", "22608870", "22668700", "24800144", "25083235", "21839687", "22368709", "21292625", "22052899", "23027451", "23209450", "29090134", "22155574", "22129458", "23251760", "22018015", "21883113", "21865093", "21883108", "21159391", "21831166", "21292816", "21813576", "21797829", "21729112", "21886055", "21748749", "21729848", "21719560", "21385784", "21641504", "21254304", "21329402", "21437504", "21204591", "21087065", "21818443", "21050443", "20940385", "20606016", "20809664", "20554575", "20634645", "19808842", "20418534", "20406314", "20497929", "20437287", "20413615", "20456742", "19762661", "25132881", "20212304", "20104939"], "label": "0"}

CASE SUMMARY: A 16-year-old Hispanic girl was admitted to the state psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Clozapine therapy was initiated, and after three months of treatment the patient began experiencing episodes of nocturnal enuresis. The bladder-selective agent tolterodine was tried and subsequently failed to resolve the enuresis episodes. Desmopressin was initiated, which resulted in amelioration of symptoms. DISCUSSION: This is the first published report of using tolterodine to treat clozapine-induced nocturnal enuresis. Several methods to decrease clozapine-induced urinary incontinence have been used and typically include the addition of agents with high anticholinergic properties. Tolterodine is a bladder-selective anticholinergic agent indicated for the treatment of urinary urge incontinence and may be employed as a treatment for antipsychotic-induced incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: Nocturnal enuresis is an adverse effect that infrequently occurs with use of clozapine therapy. Although tolterodine was ineffective in our patient to treat clozapine-induced nocturnal enuresis, further trials are required to appropriately evaluate the effectiveness of tolterodine to treat this adverse drug reaction.", "outbound_citations": ["10221366", "9671109", "9121357", "9378693", "8968308", "8968299", "8732317", "8543547", "7864282", "1363418", "3779278", "28599"], "inbound_citations": ["35086595", "33065718", "33009223", "30282229"], "label": "0"}

Sixty-eight children with refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis were included. They all had a maximal cystometric capacity less than the age-expected value. RCT was done by water loading and retention to the point of urgency once daily. During training, changes in bladder capacity were evaluated by voiding charts.

After 4 weeks of RCT, the bladder capacity increased in 20.6%. Combining RCT with oxybutynin led in the end to normalization of the bladder capacity in 79.4%. Older age and high-pressure DOA negatively influenced the ability to increase the bladder capacity. Fifteen children became completely dry, mainly by converting enuresis to nocturia. Unsuccessful RCT is often caused by DOA, especially if a bladder capacity rise of at least 10% cannot be achieved within 4 weeks.

CASE SUMMARY: Two patients, each receiving warfarin for stroke prophylaxis in association with chronic atrial fibrillation, developed adverse effects after the initiation of tolterodine for urinary disorders. Other medications for concurrent medical diagnoses had remained unchanged. One patient had an episode of prostatitis, which was treated with levofloxacin immediately prior to tolterodine initiation. The warfarin dosage had remained constant for many weeks in both patients prior to and during the tolterodine trials. In each patient, the initiation of tolterodine was associated with a significant increase in the patient's INR measured 10\u201314 days later. Thus, tolterodine was ineffective in both patients and was discontinued one to two days before the elevated INRs were determined during routine clinic visits. INRs determined approximately two weeks after tolterodine was discontinued were similar to those obtained during the period before the use of the drug; the warfarin dosage remained unchanged. Rechallenge with tolterodine was not attempted in either patient. DISCUSSION: Several aspects of the reported cases support the validity of a proposed drug interaction when tolterodine is initiated in a patient stabilized on warfarin therapy. The temporal association of the course of tolterodine with an elevated INR, the return to the previous warfarin dose\u2013INR response relationship after tolterodine discontinuation, and the absence of other causes for the elevated INR were factors found in both patients.

Plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of the R-enantiomers of OXY and DEO were slightly lower than the S-enantiomers following transdermal OXY. The relative AUC values were S-OXY>S-DEO>R-OXY>R-DEO. The AUC ratios of DEO/ OXY were less than 1 for both the R- and S- enantiomers. Following oral dosing, plasma DEO concentrations greatly exceeded OXY resulting in relative AUC values of R-DEO>S-DEO>S-OXY>R-OXY. The mean AUC ratios of S- and R-DEO/OXY were 3.25 and 8.93, respectively. Stereoselective metabolism of OXY was evident following both transdermal and oral administration of OXY. The reduced pre-systemic metabolism of transdermally administered OXY compared to oral administration resulted in not only significantly lower DEO plasma concentrations, but also a different metabolite pattern. The differences between R-OXY and R-DEO following the two routes of administration support the potential for comparable clinical efficacy and reduced anticholinergic side-effects with transdermal treatment.", "outbound_citations": ["3234461", "10613609", "9825119", "9720583", "9072550", "8824691", "1640530", "1455904", "1993995", "2023781", "1888628", "2082973", "2253557", "2810112", "2667633", "2680402", "2849672", "7006730", "4380481", "14071437", "2005707", "2198921"], "inbound_citations": ["33368382", "33191204", "32884926", "28608746", "26634274", "26166934", "24036364", "23669567", "23867086", "23730870", "22927031", "22909146", "21428701", "22607010", "19275276", "21721591", "24198630", "24198618", "20216524"], "label": "0"}

This assumption is incorrect. Both flavoxate and oxybutynin are tertiary amines. 2 Because of this chemical structure\u2013activity relationship, both of these medications penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Incidences of neuropsychiatric adverse events are, in fact, reported for every pharmacotherapeutic agent used for urge incontinence and overactive bladder (OAB). Therefore, the assumption that flavoxate does not act in the central nervous system (CNS) and hence is less likely to cause neuropsychiatric adverse events does not appear to be valid. 3,4 This assumption is predicated on the findings that, in addition to the peripheral muscle relaxant actions of flavoxate, helpful in treatment of urge incontinence, flavoxate acts in the CNS to suppress the micturition reflex of OAB. Flavoxate was found to act on the micturition center in the brain stem, increasing bladder capacity. 4 Flavoxate also inhibits cyclic adenosine monophosphate formation in the rat striatal membranes of the brain, 3 via the stimulation of pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G protein\u2013coupled receptors (e.g., adenosine A 1 , dopamine D 2 , and adrenaline 2 receptors). The PTX-sensitive G proteins in the brain seem to be involved in the flavoxate-induced suppression of isovolumetric rhythmic bladder contraction. 3 Consistent with this argument, both of these drugs are reported 5 to have the same incidence of neuropsychiatric adverse events (1\u201310%). These findings are not surprising, because both of these medications penetrate the bloodbrain barrier and act in the CNS.", "outbound_citations": ["11207885", "9562151", "8842386", "2779004"], "inbound_citations": ["26663730"], "label": "0"}

Control evaluations were performed at 2, 5 and 8 months. Evaluation of the results took into account the etiology, pressure and volume at which the wave of instability appeared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results were evaluated according to patient subjective criteria. We observed a positive response (cure and improvement) to treatment with oxybutinin alone or oxybutinin+imipramine in 66.25% of the cases; side effects were observed in 44%. There was a 20% improvement in the positive response rate when the wave intensity was greater than 55 cm H2O and the bladder volume at which this occurred was greater than 150 ml. No patient treated with second line drug therapy (flavoxate, nifedipine and trospium chloride) cured.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe etiology of vesical instability did not influence response to therapy. Waves with a greater intensity and those that appeared at higher volumes responded better to treatment. Nearly half of the patients with side effects required a reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of the drug.

The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro and in vivo antimuscarinic profiles of tolterodine with those of muscarinic receptor antagonists with distinct receptor subtype-selectivity profiles: darifenacin [(S)-2-[1-[2-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)ethyl]-3-pyrrolidinyl]-2,2-d iphenylacetamide; selective for muscarinic M3 receptors]; UH-AH 37 (6-chloro-5,10-dihydro-5-[(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)acetyl]-11H-dibenzo-[b ,e][1,4]diazepine-11-one; low affinity for muscarinic M2 receptors); and AQ-RA 741 (11-([4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-py rido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one; high affinity for muscarinic M2 receptors). The in vitro profiles of these compounds were in agreement with previous reports; darifenacin and UH-AH 37 demonstrated selectivity for muscarinic M3/m3 over M2/m2 receptors, while the converse was observed for AQ-RA 741. In vivo, AQ-RA 741 was more potent (1.4-2.7-fold) in inhibiting urinary bladder contraction than salivation in the anaesthetised cat (i.e., a profile similar to that of tolterodine [2.5-3.3-fold]), while darifenacin and UH-AH 37 showed the reverse selectivity profile (0.6-0.8 and 0.4-0.5-fold, respectively). The results confirm that it is possible to separate the antimuscarinic effects on urinary bladder and salivary glands in vivo. The data on UH-AH 37 and darifenacin support the view that a selectivity for muscarinic M3/m3 over M2/m2 receptors may result in a more pronounced effect on salivation than on bladder contraction.

Recently implemented rules and regulations for nursing home care (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act [OBRA] 1987) [1] require that incontinent nursing home residents have a basic diagnostic assessment and that residents managed by an indwelling bladder catheter have an appropriate indication for this device documented in their medical record. The federally mandated Minimum Data Set (MDS) [2] includes a separate section for the documentation of continence status that is completed by nursing home staff within 14 days of admission and updated on a quarterly basis. Incontinence documented on the MDS should trigger the use of the Resident Assessment Protocol for incontinence [3]. Some of this assessment can be done by a trained nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, or clinical nurse specialist with input from members of the nursing home interdisciplinary team. The assessment does, however, require the involvement of the primary physician. We provide an overview of the assessment and treatment of incontinence in the nursing home setting. Prevalence and Morbidity Urinary incontinence affects approximately half of nursing home residents [4, 5]. The prevalence varies among individual facilities depending on the case mix; rates may range from 40% to 70% or even higher in facilities with a functionally impaired resident population. In contrast to urinary incontinence among ambulatory community-dwelling geriatric patients, urinary incontinence among nursing home residents is more severe and more commonly associated with fecal incontinence. Incontinent nursing home residents generally have multiple episodes of urinary incontinence throughout the day and night, and approximately half are also incontinent of stool more than once per week [5, 6]. Urinary incontinence in the nursing home is associated with substantial morbidity and cost. It can predispose patients to skin irritation, make pressure ulcers difficult to heal [7], and result in symptomatic urinary tract infection when urinary retention with overflow urinary incontinence remains undiagnosed or when urinary incontinence is inappropriately managed by long-term use of an indwelling catheter [8, 9]. It may also lead to falls among residents with nocturia and urge urinary incontinence and impaired balance or gait [10]. The adverse psychological effects of urinary incontinence among nursing home residents have been difficult to document systematically [11], but incontinent residents who do not have severe dementia are often embarrassed and frustrated by their urinary incontinence. Nursing home staff generally consider urinary incontinence to be one of the most onerous and difficult conditions for which they care, and they perceive that they spend a disproportionate amount of time on the care of incontinent residents. The economic costs of urinary incontinence in the nursing home have been estimated to be close to $5 billion annually, including the costs of staff time, laundry, and supplies [12]. Types and Causes of Urinary Incontinence The pathogenesis of urinary incontinence among nursing home residents is often multifactorial, involving urologic and gynecologic conditions, neurologic disorders, behavioral and psychological factors, and functional impairments. Thus, the approach to assessment and treatment must be comprehensive and consider all of these potential factors. The most important factors to consider are those that are reversible. Potentially reversible conditions that can contribute to urinary incontinence in nursing home residents are listed in Table 1. These factors can be recalled by the acronym DRIP (delirium; restricted mobility, retention; infection, inflammation, impaction; polyuria, pharmaceuticals). Although identification and management of these reversible factors may not cure the urinary incontinence, its severity may be reduced and thereby be made more manageable by other interventions. In addition, identification and management of these conditions may have important benefits for the resident's overall functioning and quality of life. Table 1. Potentially Reversible Conditions That Can Cause or Contribute to Urinary Incontinence in Nursing Home Residents A classification of the basic types of persistent urinary incontinence is shown in Table 2. Three important features of this classification should be noted. First, from a neurologic perspective, this classification is greatly simplified and does not include all of the pathophysiologic types of urinary incontinence. For example, patients with suprasacral spinal cord lesions, such as those that can occur in multiple sclerosis, may have detrusor hyperreflexia with external sphincter dyssynergy that can result in incontinence and incomplete bladder emptying (detrusor-sphincter dyssynergy). Second, many incontinent nursing home residents have mixtures of these types of incontinence. The predominant abnormality of lower urinary tract functioning found among nursing home residents is detrusor hyperactivity (involuntary bladder contractions found on cystometry; also called detrusor instability, unstable bladder, and detrusor hyperreflexia [the latter occurs in the presence of a neurologic disorder]). Although most often associated with urge urinary incontinence, detrusor hyperactivity is commonly seen with sphincter weakness and stress urinary incontinence among women and with obstruction in men with benign or malignant enlargement of the prostate. Interestingly, detrusor hyperactivity is also seen in continent elderly people (men more frequently than women) [13, 14]; thus, its precise role in the pathogenesis of incontinence in the nursing home population is incompletely understood. In nursing home residents, detrusor hyperactivity is commonly associated with impaired bladder contractility that results in incomplete bladder emptying (called detrusor hyperactivity with impaired contractility) [15, 16]. Nursing home residents with this disorder may have symptoms that mimic stress, overflow, or urge incontinence. Third, and most importantly, functional urinary incontinence should be a diagnosis of exclusion because most nursing home residents have impairments of cognitive or physical functioning that may interfere with their ability to use a toilet. These residents may also have other potentially treatable conditions that contribute to their urinary incontinence. Thus, a search for reversible factors and other types of urinary incontinence should be done before a nursing home resident's urinary incontinence is labeled as functional. Table 2. Types and Causes of Urinary Incontinence Assessment Nursing home residents are heterogeneous, and a realistic and appropriate goal for one type of resident may be unrealistic and inappropriate for another [17, 18]. The approach to urinary incontinence brings this concept into sharp focus. A resident having active rehabilitation after a hip fracture or a stroke may, after a thorough incontinence assessment, benefit from a specific bladder-retraining protocol or pharmacologic therapy for detrusor hyperactivity; incontinence undergarments and indwelling catheters are probably inappropriate for this type of resident. On the other hand, a resident with end-stage dementia and severe agitation may be most appropriately managed by an incontinence undergarment after reversible causes of their urinary incontinence have been excluded. Thus, an important aspect of incontinence care is to determine, through the interdisciplinary care-planning process, if a particular resident has the potential to respond to specific interventions for the urinary incontinence. Because even severely impaired residents may respond well to a prompted voiding program (see below), a bias in favor of thorough assessment and a therapeutic trial is appropriate. Basic assessment of bladder and bowel function as indicated on the MDS is required for all newly admitted nursing home residents. A bladder and bowel record is helpful in documenting the continence status of new residents and can also be used as part of periodic reassessments. A legible record, such as the one shown in Figure 1, should be used [19]. The specific symbols used are not important, but the record should provide a simple way of documenting wetness, dryness, appropriate toileting, and bowel status and a space for comments. Records such as the one shown in Figure 1 can be reduced so that several records fit on one page. This type of record is also helpful in monitoring responses to therapeutic interventions. Because many newly admitted residents come from acute-care hospitals, they frequently arrive at the nursing home with an indwelling bladder catheter. In this situation, it is essential to determine why the catheter was placed (for example, to monitor urinary output or for urinary retention or management of urinary incontinence) and to consider the resident for a bladder-retraining program. The catheter should be removed unless there is an appropriate indication for retaining it. Figure 1. Example of a record that is helpful in assessing incontinent nursing home residents and in following their response to intervention. Basic Evaluation After these initial assessments and documentation, incontinent nursing home residents should have a basic evaluation that includes a history, physical examination, urinalysis, and determination of postvoid residual urine volume. Much of this evaluation can be done by nursing home staff and a physician extender [nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, or clinical nurse specialist]. This basic evaluation has three objectives: 1) to identify potentially reversible factors (Table 1); 2) to identify potentially serious underlying conditions or conditions that may require further urologic, gynecologic, or urodynamic evaluation (Table 3); and 3) to determine the type of incontinence (urge, stress, overflow, or mix", "outbound_citations": ["7884119", "8116998", "8272292", "8411453", "8227902", "8409176", "8409175", "8315230", "8463522", "8440494", "8501831", "1447437", "1375659", "1740597", "1727847", "1443972", "1545835", "2071809", "2039897", "1987410", "1988894", "2211131", "2354796", "2354790", "2406463", "2313014", "2179381", "2107245", "2572706", "2809052", "2794323", "2754155", "2754156", "2500903", "2496240", "2675580", "2649539", "2909873", "3193520", "3198942", "3139732", "3411676", "3680838", "3680883", "3668135", "3312641", "3586227", "3565965", "3826097", "3813746", "3536055", "3776752", "2423716", "3944409", "2863391", "4050608", "4008846", "3917465", "6740849", "6633618", "6885672", "6841856", "7109138", "7007662", "13498030"], "inbound_citations": ["32335340", "32216955", "31487923", "30690650", "30442174", "29282013", "27603916", "27176184", "25615885", "26168392", "24780187", "23639715", "23764480", "23943373", "22858237", "21275440", "21296457", "20631404"], "label": "0"}

The goal is to increase bladder capacity, and decrease intravesical pressure in order to maintain continence between catheterizations. The most commonly used anticholinergic medication in the United States is Oxybutynin. Previous clinical studies have shown that 61% of the patients on oral Oxybutynin report adverse systemic side effects and are noncompliant in taking it. In 48% of the patients, possibly due to their noncompliance, oral Oxybutynin Hydrochloride is ineffective. In this study, 13 spinal cord injured patients with a failure to restore bladder dysfunction were treated with intravesical Oxybutynin. Nine patients improved on the regimen while one patient underwent surgical bladder augmentation. Postoperatively, this patient continued to be incontinent between catheterizations. Reinstitution of intravesical Oxybutynin stabilized the patient's bladder with clean intermittent catheterization without further intervention. After 3 months post instillation in the urodynamic studies, the mean bladder capacity increased, the mean volume at first contraction increased and the leak point pressure decreased. The decrease in leak point pressure was statistically significant. Leak point pressure is one of the most important parameters we monitor to preserve upper urinary tract function. We recommend the trial of intravesical Oxybutynin for patients who fit the criteria of the protocol prior to surgical bladder augmentation.", "outbound_citations": ["7742846", "8126833", "8015832", "8411446", "8351768", "8516987", "1640530", "1861294", "2005707", "2023781", "2819387", "2724432", "2667633", "2908945", "3361663", "3959249", "7006730", "6243894", "790746"], "inbound_citations": ["35226282", "31670462", "30138720", "28120444", "27241452", "24072665", "22976530", "21798658", "21639723", "20877604"], "label": "0"}

It is important, therefore, to consider non-compliance in economic evaluations. A review of pharmacoeconomic evaluations, which have applied sensitivity analysis to non-compliance rates, was undertaken to evaluate the impact of non-compliance on the cost-effectiveness of different drug therapies. Although 22 evaluations satisfied the inclusion criteria, additional information was obtained from the authors of most studies, as the published details were inadequate. The majority of evaluations assumed altered effectiveness owing to reduced compliance in the absence of supportive clinical evidence. Because of the disparity in the nature of the outcomes, the measures of non-compliance and the time horizon of the studies evaluated, it was not possible to compare the magnitude of the impact of non-compliance among different drug-disease combinations. However, it was evident that non-compliance always results in a reduction in efficacy, but its impact on costs varied substantially.

The drugs were given on separate consecutive days, before, during and after the co-administration of tolterodine.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean serum tolterodine concentrations were 5-10 times higher in PMs than in EMs. Serum concentrations of the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite of tolterodine, 5-HM, were not quantifiable in PMs. The mean MR of debrisoquine (95% confidence interval) during tolterodine treatment was 0.50 (0.25-0.99) and did not differ statistically from the values before [0.49 (0.20-1.2)] and after tolterodine administration [0.46 (0.14-1.6)] in EMs. The mean MR of omeprazole hydroxylation and sulphoxidation or caffeine metabolism were not changed in the presence of tolterodine in either EMs or PMs. Debrisoquine and caffeine had no significant effect on the AUC(1,3 h) of either tolterodine or 5-HM, but during omeprazole administration small decreases (13-19%) in these parameters were seen.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTolterodine, administered at twice the expected therapeutic dosage, did not change the disposition of the probe drugs debrisoquine, omeprazole and caffeine and thus had no detectable effect on the activities of CYPs 2D6, 2C19, 3A4 and 1A2. Alteration of the metabolism of substrates of these enzymes by tolterodine is unlikely to occur.", "outbound_citations": ["10583027", "9630826", "9531513", "9467475", "9776013", "9278208", "9353847", "9447563", "9247842", "8807660", "9156692", "8880055", "8747407", "8689941", "7781267", "8143395", "8004131", "8477556", "1345344", "1371482", "1981321", "2349617", "3588528", "4027124", "6480786", "71525", "71400", "838796", "9144906", "9200560", "9131484", "PMC2042829", "2744073", "3533565", "PMC1368259", "PMC1463875", "PMC2014365"], "inbound_citations": ["30451124", "28271978", "27829538", "27566010"], "label": "1"}

A major active metabolite, (PNU-200577) the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative of tolterodine, has a similar pharmacological profile. Based on pharmacological and pharmacokinetic data, it has been concluded that this metabolite contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect of tolterodine. The bladder selectivity demonstrated by tolterodine and PNU-200577 in vivo cannot be attributed to selectivity for a single muscarinic receptor subtype. Moreover, this favourable tissue-selectivity seems to occur also in humans. Tolterodine is well tolerated and it exerts a marked effect on bladder function in healthy volunteers. Phase II data indicate that tolterodine is an efficacious and safe treatment for patients with idiopathic detrusor instability or detrusor hyperreflexia.

A range of therapeutic options are available; however, antimuscarinic agents form the mainstay of treatment. Of these agents, tolterodine and oxybutynin are the most widely used. It is well documented that the immediate-release (IR) formulations of these agents have equivalent efficacy in relieving OAB symptoms. However, tolterodine demonstrates a more favorable tolerability profile, particularly in terms of the frequency and severity of dry mouth. Due to the development of novel drug delivery systems, extended-release (ER) formulations of both oxybutynin and tolterodine are now available, permitting once-daily dosing. The convenience of once-daily dosing of antimuscarinic agents would be expected to improve patient compliance and further relieve the symptoms of OAB. Clinical studies with the ER formulations of tolterodine and oxybutynin demonstrate potential clinical advantages over their respective IR forms in terms of either efficacy or tolerability or both, although the therapeutic index of tolterodine ER appears to show a greater advantage over its IR counterpart compared with oxybutynin ER and its IR form. Importantly, the two ER agents have not been compared directly in a head-to-head clinical study. Overall, available clinical data suggest that the newly developed ER formulation of tolterodine represents a significant therapeutic advancement in the treatment of OAB.", "outbound_citations": ["11412210", "11322350", "11248608", "11125420", "11145628", "11327200", "11286323", "11183899", "11183901", "10775736", "10772377", "10798461", "10495070", "10429321", "10332441", "10397381", "10363730", "10233562", "10210604", "10073329", "10221366", "10084408", "10491727", "10543335", "9863856", "9666761", "9510336", "9495736", "9434659", "9883934", "9467475", "9426760", "9426747", "9247842", "7706631", "7620236", "1455904", "2102668", "2385880", "7109744"], "inbound_citations": ["34453427", "31963671", "29394001", "29205506", "29385787", "28661154", "27631838", "27130264", "27324282", "27377941", "27217862", "27034721", "26699930", "26760214", "26121223", "25640110", "25348235", "24785989", "24568181", "24036011", "23190249", "23140754", "22607010", "21761872", "24198630", "20466335", "20877608"], "label": "0"}

We investigated the effects of tolterodine and its major active metabolite, DD 01 (PNU-200577), (R)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethylphenyl)-3-phenylpropa namine, on the contractions induced by carbachol, KCl, CaCl2 and electrical field stimulation in human isolated urinary bladder smooth muscles, using the muscle bath technique. Specimens of human urinary bladder were obtained from 20 patients who underwent total cystectomy due to malignant bladder tumor. The detrusor preparations were taken from the intact part of the dome region of the bladder. Carbachol (10(-9)-10(-2) M) caused concentration-dependent contraction of human detrusor smooth muscles. Tolterodine (10(-9)-10(-6) M), DD 01 (10(-9)-10(-6) M), oxybutynin (10(-8)-10(-6) M), propiverine (10(-8)-10(-6) M), atropine (10(-9)-10(-6) M), pirenzepine (10(-8)-10(-5) M), methoctramine (10(-8)-10(-5) M) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) (10(-9)-10(-6) M) caused typical shifts to the right of the concentration-response curves for carbachol, except for higher concentrations (10(-5) M) of oxybutynin and propiverine, which caused a decrease of about 30% of the maximum contractile responses to carbachol. All the slopes of the regression lines of Schild plots were close to unity, and the rank order of pA2 values was: atropine = DD 01 = tolterodine = 4-DAMP = oxybutynin > propiverine = pirenzepine > methoctramine. Tolterodine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) and DD 01 (10(-9)-10(-6) M) did not inhibit the KCl-induced (80 mM) and CaCl2-induced (5 mM) contractions, while oxybutynin (10(-8)-10(-5) M) and propiverine (10(-8)-10(-5) M) significantly inhibited the contractions. Electrical field stimulation (2-60 Hz) caused frequency-dependent contraction of human detrusor smooth muscles, which were significantly inhibited by various drugs. In the presence of 10(-6) M atropine, tolterodine and DD 01 did not inhibit the residual contractions induced by electrical field stimulation at any of the frequencies, while oxybutynin (10(-5) M) and propiverine (10(-5) M) significantly inhibited the atropine-resistant part of the contractions. The results suggest that the inhibitory effects of tolterodine and DD 01 are mediated only by their antimuscarinic action, which is equal to that of oxybutynin and significantly greater than that of propiverine, and that tolterodine and DD 01 have neither Ca2+ channel antagonist action nor inhibitory effect on the atropine-resistant part of the contractions in human detrusor smooth muscles.

Method: In this study we report 39 children with myelodysplasia, neurogenic bladder disturbance with detrusor hyperreflexia and/or high bladder pressure treated with CIC to which intravesical oxybutynin 0.1 mg/kg twice daily was added and administered as a sterile pharmacy-produced solution. The follow-up period was 0.66\u20135 years (mean 2.25). Results: Continence was clearly promoted and urodynamic parameters improved whereas an increased occurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and lower urinary tract infections was noted. Compliance was good, adverse reactions rare, and in some cases vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) resolved. Also infants and very young children were treated without complications. Conclusions: Intravesical oxybutynin is effective to diminish bladder pathophysiology and promote continence in this patient group and is also well tolerated. Attention should be paid to the occurrence of urinary tract infections and VUR may resolve.", "outbound_citations": ["8996387", "8808907", "8683776", "7658264", "8126787", "10071538", "8417203", "1433617", "1640530", "1496955", "1957602", "1861294", "1907331", "2023781", "2249125", "2374216", "3336111", "4057409", "3899664", "6854783", "7163785", "7315191", "7330611", "7330612", "6127859", "7401243", "7420551", "534832", "364631", "1200814", "4591726", "5047425", "4380481"], "inbound_citations": ["35500302", "34866570", "33368382", "28712052", "23669567", "24498490", "23312642", "21779920", "21989529"], "label": "0"}

Tolterodine is a bladder-selective, antimuscarinic agent for the treatment of frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence that characterize overactive bladder. In a 9-month open-label study, the safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of tolterodine 2 mg twice daily was evaluated in 854 patients with overactive bladder symptoms who had completed one of four 12 week randomized, controlled trials of tolterodine. Safety and tolerability were assessed in terms of adverse events and clinical/laboratory variables. Efficacy was assessed using micturition diaries and patient perception of their bladder condition. In all, 70% of patients remained on treatment for 9 months. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event, occurring in 28% of patients (intensity: 19% mild, 7% moderate, 2% severe). A total of 9% of patients withdrew due to adverse events. Dosage reduction occurred in 13% of patients. Significant improvements (P < 0.0001) in micturitions per 24 h (-22%), urge incontinence episodes per 24 h (-76%) and volume voided per micturition (+22%) were observed after 9 months of treatment, with 65% of patients reporting an improvement in perception of their bladder problems. The incidence of adverse events and improvements in micturition diary variables during open-label treatment were comparable with those observed during a 12 week randomized treatment. It was concluded that tolterodine is well tolerated and maintains its clinical efficacy during 9 months of treatment. The high proportion of patients remaining on treatment indicates that tolterodine is an effective long-term treatment for overactive bladder.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["26355637", "25369726", "25725183", "24971138", "24567280", "23062115", "23659987", "26816685", "21830836", "21489081", "20367449"], "label": "1"}

The prevalence of these events was compared with that in patient cohorts for other drugs on the PEM database. The age- and sex-adjusted relative risk of hallucinations on tolterodine compared with 10 drugs of other therapeutic classes, and with terodiline, another drug indicated for bladder instability, was 4.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.72 to 8.66] and 1.25 (95% CI 0.62 to 2.53), respectively.

The dose was titrated until effective (onset of complete diurnal urinary continence), maximal recommended dosage was achieved or bothersome anticholinergic side effects developed. An independent observer recorded the dose used, anticholinergic side effects and efficacy of therapy (incidence of urinary frequency, urgency, posturing and urinary incontinence).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study included 86 girls and 46 boys. There were no statistically significant differences among the 3 treatment groups regarding the presence of peripheral or central nervous system anticholinergic side effects. Extended release oxybutynin and long acting tolterodine were significantly more effective at reducing daytime urinary incontinence than immediate release tolterodine (p <0.01 and 0 <0.05, respectively). Extended release oxybutynin was significantly more effective then long acting tolterodine for complete resolution of diurnal incontinence (p <0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nExtended release oxybutynin and long acting tolterodine are more effective than immediate release tolterodine in decreasing diurnal urinary incontinence.

Binding of tolterodine and the two metabolites to human serum albumin and \u03b11\u2010acid glycoprotein (AAG) was also assessed, as was binding of tolterodine to red blood cells. Ex vivo protein binding of tolterodine and 5\u2010HM was determined in serum samples from healthy volunteers treated with oral tolterodine 4 mg twice daily for 8 days. Tolterodine exhibited high protein binding in human serum; the unbound fraction (fu) was 3.7%. The unbound fraction of tolterodine in cat and dog serum (1.5 and 2.1%, respectively) was lower compared with human serum; fu was higher in the other species investigated (rat, 22%; mouse, 16\u201317%; rabbit, 39%). The unbound fraction of 5\u2010HM was much higher in serum from humans (36%) and all animal species investigated (mouse, 72%; rabbit, 68%; cat, 32%; dog, 45%). Binding of N\u2010dealkylated tolterodine to proteins in human serum was intermediate (fu 14%). AAG was the major binding protein for tolterodine and 5\u2010HM, and the degree of binding increased with increasing concentration of the protein. The association constant of 5\u2010HM for AAG was lower than that of tolterodine (1.3\u00d7105 M\u22121 versus 2.1\u00d7106 M\u22121). The blood:plasma tolterodine concentration ratio was 0.6 in both humans and dog; thus, a minor fraction of tolterodine was present in red blood cells compared with plasma (0.18 and 0.36, respectively). In the mouse, tolterodine was equally present in blood and plasma. In ex vivo samples, fu values for tolterodine (pH adjusted) varied between 1.6 and 4.9% (mean 2.8%), which could be explained by differences in AAG concentrations. There was good correlation between observed fu values for tolterodine and those predicted on the basis of AAG levels. Similar findings were observed for 5\u2010HM.

CASE SUMMARY: An 81-year-old white woman with urge incontinence experienced malaise, fever, and gastrointestinal disturbances 18 days after starting tolterodine 2 mg twice daily. The patient's concurrent medications included flunitrazepam, diclofenac, and dorzolamide/timolol eye drops. Laboratory examination was consistent with the presentation of an acute mixed liver injury with increased transaminase enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, \u03bb-glutamyltransferase, and bilirubin. Additionally, she had mild leukocytosis with eosinophilia. After tolterodine was discontinued, the abnormal liver and hematologic parameters returned to normal within 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: Tolterodine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, has predominantly anticholinergic effects. To our knowledge, this is the first case published describing tolterodine-associated acute mixed liver injury. However, some of the patient's additional symptoms can also be considered part of a drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome. This is usually defined by the triad of fever, cutaneous reaction, and involvement of internal organs, mainly affecting the liver. The close temporal relationship between the start of tolterodine therapy and the first symptoms and the reversibility after dechallenge led us to conclude that the adverse reaction was possibly related to tolterodine exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our case illustrates that tolterodine may rarely be associated with liver injury. This may have been an organ manifestation of tolterodine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.", "outbound_citations": ["11075787", "11139675", "10534221", "9798755", "7794310", "2254635", "7249508"], "inbound_citations": ["36795936", "25444550", "24798455"], "label": "1"}

Metabolic activities were determined in liver microsomes from two donors using the following selective substrates: dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), denitronifedipine (CYP3A4), caffeine (CYP1A2), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1), S-(+)-mephenytoin (CYP2C19), S-(-)-warfarin (CYP2C9) and coumarin (CYP2A6). Incubations with each substrate were carried out without a possible inhibitor and in the presence of trospium chloride at varying concentrations (37-3000 microM) at 37 degrees in 0.1 M KH2PO4 buffer containing up to 3% DMSO. Metabolite concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in all cases except CYP2A6 where direct fluorescence spectroscopy was used. First, trospium chloride IC50 values were determined for each substrate at respective K(M) concentrations. Trospium chloride did not show relevant inhibitory effects on the metabolism of most substrates (IC50 values considerably higher than 1 mM). The only clear inhibition was seen for the CYP2D6-dependent high-affinity O-demethylation of dextromethorphan, where IC50 values of 27 microM and 44 microM were observed. Therefore, additional dextromethorphan concentrations (0.4-2000 microM) were tested. Trospium chloride was a competitive inhibitor of the reaction with Ki values of 20 and 51 microM, respectively. Thus, trospium chloride has negligible inhibitory effects on CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6 activity but is a reasonably potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro. Compared to therapeutic trospium chloride peak plasma concentrations below 50 nM, the 1000-times higher competitive inhibition constant Ki however suggests that inhibition of CYP2D6 by trospium chloride is without any clinical relevance.", "outbound_citations": ["9929510", "9571301", "9435993", "9305587", "9195021", "8794469", "8861732", "9156694", "8851634", "9010587", "7788255", "7782485", "8110777", "1739411", "1581537", "1944238", "1981505", "2568906", "3605590", "3741535", "4096368", "2861949", "14907713"], "inbound_citations": ["32500759", "29709423", "28747995", "23800037", "22871042", "22876096", "15482001", "20022086"], "label": "0"}

Nonblind, randomised, 2-way crossover trial. 19 healthy volunteers (7 females, 12 males), mean age 33 years (range 18 to 55 years). Prior to the study, all volunteers were classified as either extensive or poor metabolisers by cytochrome P450 2D6 genotyping. Volunteers received tolterodine ER 4mg once daily or tolterodine IR 2mg twice daily for 6 days (all doses given as the L-tartrate salt). A washout period of 7 days separated the 2 treatments. Serum concentrations of tolterodine, its active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-HM) and the active moiety (extensive metabolisers: sum of unbound tolterodine + 5-HM; poor metabolisers: unbound tolterodine) were measured for up to 48 hours post-dose on day 6 (steady state). Tolerability was also determined. 17 volunteers (13 extensive metabolisers, 4 poor metabolisers) completed the study and were evaluable for both treatment periods. The 90% confidence interval for the geometric mean ratio of area under the serum concentration-time curve to 24 hours (AUC24) of the active moiety, for all volunteers combined, indicated equivalence for the 2 formulations. Pooled analysis also demonstrated that the peak serum concentration (Cmax) of the active moiety following administration of tolterodine ER was around 75% of that observed for the IR tablet, whereas the trough concentration was around 1.5-fold higher. Overall, the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine (irrespective of genotype) and 5-HM (extensive metabolisers only) were consistent with sustained drug release over 24 hours. Tolterodine ER was well tolerated. The new once daily ER formulation of tolterodine 4mg shows pharmacokinetic equivalence (AUC24) to the existing IR tablet given at a dose of 2mg twice daily.

Cancer Three trials examining the effectiveness of tamoxifen for the prevention of breast cancer and one trial looking at mammographyall of which were conducted in 1998are discussed here. Fisher B, Costantino JP, Wickerham DL, et al. Tamoxifen for prevention of breast cancer: report of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 Study. J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998; 90:1371-88. This 4-year multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled trial studied 13 388 women at increased risk for breast cancer. Seventy-six percent of the participants had a first-degree relative with breast cancer. The results showed that tamoxifen, an antiestrogen, reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer, with a relative risk of 0.51. However, the absolute risk reduction over 5 years of treatment was only 1.7% (number needed to treat [NNT], 60). Whether this intervention decreases breast cancer mortality rates is unknown. The study showed that for every 1000 women treated for 5 years, there were 17 fewer cases of invasive breast cancer and 7 fewer cases of ductal carcinoma in situ; however, there were also 5 additional episodes of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and 7 additional cases of endometrial cancer (see Table 1 for secondary endpoint results). These researchers suggest that all women receiving tamoxifen should undergo regular gynecologic examinations. Table 1. Secondary End Point Results Associated with Tamoxifen Treatment The other two breast cancer prevention trials were the Royal Marsden Tamoxifen Trial (1) and the Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study (2). In the Royal Marsden Tamoxifen Trial, 2494 women with a family history of breast cancer in at least one first-degree relative were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen or placebo and were followed for a median of 70 months. At the conclusion of the trial, the incidence of breast cancer in the treatment group (2.7%) and placebo group(2.9%) was the same. In the Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study, 5408 healthy women at low to average risk for breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen or placebo and were followed for a median of 46 months. This study did not show a difference in the incidence of breast cancer between the two groups; the cumulative incidence of breast cancer was 0.8% in the placebo group and 0.7% in the tamoxifen group. Both of these studies had limitations (for example, small sample size, high drop-out rates, concomitant use of hormone replacement therapy, and lower incidence of breast cancer in the Italian trial) that may have reduced their power to detect a benefit of tamoxifen. Fisher and colleagues' study, which is the best-conducted and largest of the trials, demonstrated a small but definite reduction in the incidence of breast cancer in high-risk women given tamoxifen chemoprophylaxis. Another study of note is the Gothenburg breast screening trial (3), which examined the efficacy of mammography for decreasing breast cancer mortality rates in women 39 to 49 years of age. The study showed that screening mammography performed every 18 months saves lives, but the actual impact is small. Screening 10 000 women during a 10-year period would save 13 lives and require 1300 additional mammograms and 460 biopsies. Women can be advised that mammography between the ages of 39 and 49 years decreases their chances of dying of breast cancer by about 1/1000, but this benefit is accompanied by a 5% risk for needing a biopsy. Stroke and Atrial Fibrillation The best treatment approach for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation or carotid artery stenosis continues to evolve. Two important studies published in 1998 addressed these topics. Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at low risk of stroke during treatment with aspirin: Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation III Study. The SPAF III Writing Committee for the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Investigators. JAMA.1998; 279:1273-7. Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation are at increased risk for stroke. Previous studies have shown that advanced age and clinical risk factors (for example, previous transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, clinical coronary artery disease, thyrotoxicosis, or diabetes mellitus) largely determine the risk for stroke in these patients. Given the risks of treatment, it is important to clarify which groups of patients benefit the most, and least, from anticoagulation for stroke reduction. This 2-year prospective cohort study attempted to determine whether therapy with aspirin, 325 mg/d, was appropriate for patients at low risk for ischemic stroke. The low-risk status was determined by the fact that the patients had not had recent congestive heart failure (or a left ventricular fractional shortening 25%), had not had a previous thromboembolic event, and were not women older than 75 years of age. The rate of primary events (ischemic stroke or systemic embolization) with aspirin therapy was 2.2% per year, and the rate of disabling stroke was 0.8% per year. The study also revealed that hypertension was an important risk factor. Of note, the stroke rate in normotensive patients without the above risk factors was only 1.1% per year (0.5% per year for disabling stroke). This study indicates that when the stroke rate is balanced against the risk involved with use of warfarin (according to other studies, the major bleeding rate among patients taking warfarin is 1.2% per year), aspirin is a safe and reasonable treatment for low-risk patients. Combining the results of this study with those of previous studies suggests that patients who are 75 years of age or older or have valvular disease, congestive heart failure, previous embolic events, or hypertension should receive warfarin. Aspirin is a reasonable alternative for other patients with atrial fibrillation. Barnett HJ, Taylor DW, Eliasziw M, et al. Benefit of carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic moderate or severe stenosis. North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial Collaborators. N Engl J Med. 1998; 339:1415-25. Carotid endarterectomy has previously been shown to be beneficial for symptomatic men with greater than 70% reduction in carotid artery diameter. This randomized, controlled trial with 5-year follow-up addresses the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in men with symptomatic moderate carotid artery stenosis. The study showed that the procedure may be beneficial for men who have had recent nondisabling strokes or transient ischemic attacks with coexistent ipsilateral moderate (50% to 69%) carotid artery stenosis. The absolute risk reduction was 6.5%, and the NNT over 5 years to prevent 1 stroke was 15. The authors caution that only surgeons with considerable and specific expertise should do these procedures. Neither women nor patients with less than 50% stenosis benefited from carotid endarterectomy. The surgical group had a 4.3% perioperative increase in stroke or death rate compared with the medically treated group. Venous Thromboembolism Decousus H, Leizorovicz A, Parent F, et al. A clinical trial of vena caval filters in the prevention of pulmonary embolism in patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis. Prevention du Risque d'Embolie Pulmonaire par Interruption Cave Study Group. N Engl J Med. 1998; 338:409-15. An important study of venous thromboembolism looked at the risks and benefits of prophylactic vena caval filter placement in patients with acute deep venous thrombosis. Patients were initially given anticoagulant therapy and were randomly assigned to receive an inferior vena caval filter or not to receive a filter. The filter group had a lower rate of early pulmonary embolism (NNT to prevent one episode of pulmonary embolism at 12 days, 27), but at the cost of an increased rate of later recurrent deep venous thrombosis(number needed to cause one episode of deep venous thrombosis at 2 years, 11).The rate of recurrent pulmonary embolism at 2 years did not differ between groups. In conclusion, although filters were effective short-term prophylaxis against pulmonary embolism, use of filters is associated with significant long-term harms. Anticoagulation, whenever possible, remains the preferred method of preventing the sequelae of acute deep venous thrombosis. Hylek EM, Heiman H, Skates SJ, et al. Acetaminophen and other risk factors for excessive warfarin anticoagulation. JAMA. 1998; 279:657-62. This casecontrol study examined risk factors for an international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 6.0 in patents for whom the target INR was 2 to 3. All patients were followed in a university-based outpatient anticoagulation unit. Within 24 hours of blood sampling, patients were interviewed about use of other prescription and over-the-counter medications. Odds ratios were adjusted for variables identified as significant in a multivariate model, including advanced cancer, use of potentiating medications and excess warfarin, decreased oral intake, acute diarrhea, andvitamin K and alcohol intake. Acetaminophen was associated with a dose-dependent increase in the relative odds of having an INR of 6.0 or greater, with an adjusted odds ratio of 10.0 (95% CI, 2.6 to 37.9) for the highest dose category of 28 or more tablets", "outbound_citations": ["9494149", "9841303", "9732338", "9727891", "9727892", "9718051", "9672274", "9672273", "9652997", "9652998", "9643791", "9484373", "9428814", "9634263", "9392331", "9416884"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

This prediction is accomplished by incorporating in vitro release characteristics as an input function (A(vitro)) to a pharmacokinetics model. This simple approach often results in biased predictions of observed in vivo drug concentrations, and it can result in rejecting IVIVC. To solve this problem we propose a population IVIVC model that incorporates the in vitro information and allows one to quantify possibly changed in vivo release characteristic. The model assumes linear kinetics and describes the in vivo release as a sum of A(vitro) and a nonparametric function (A(d), a spline) representing the difference in release due to in vivo conditions. The function A(vitro) and its variability enter the model as a prior distribution. The function A(d) is estimated together with its intersubject variability. The number of parameters associated with A(d) defines the model: no parameters indicates perfect IVIVC, a large number of parameters indicates poor IVIVC. The number of parameters is determined using statistical model selection criteria. We demonstrate the approach to solve the IVIVC problem of an oral extended release oxybutynin form (OROS), administered in three pharmacokinetic studies. These studies present a particular challenging case; that is, the relative bioavailability for the OROS administration is >100% compared with that of the immediate-release form. The result of our modeling shows that the apparent lack of IVIVC can be overcome: in vivo concentration can be predicted (within or across data sets) based on in vitro release rate together with a simple form of systematic deviation from the in vitro release.", "outbound_citations": ["15965846", "9269482", "9108983"], "inbound_citations": ["33248267", "32297044", "31820258", "27631556", "25810148", "26133085", "21735135"], "label": "0"}

We review the existing evidence about the prevalence, impact and long-term followup of the overactive bladder. We also summarize the new International Continence Society terminology associated with the overactive bladder.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA MEDLINE search of all available literature regarding the epidemiology and long-term followup or outcome of the overactive bladder was performed. All articles and relevant resources cited in those articles were reviewed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe new International Continence Society terminology and definitions will allow greater consistency in future research. Two large, recently published surveys of the prevalence of overactive bladder give new insight into the widespread nature of the problem and its significant impact on quality of life. There is little good quality evidence currently available on the long-term outcome of overactive bladder.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is little published evidence regarding the natural history of overactive bladder. While recent studies have improved understanding the prevalence of the condition, we still know little about long-term outcome. The few published studies suggest that it is a chronic condition that persists urodynamically and symptomatically.", "outbound_citations": ["11857671", "11412210", "11374317", "11183899", "10827042", "10647687", "11052566", "9634028", "9586590", "9883934", "9426746", "8790229", "7663917", "8369061", "1942274", "2313045", "2179368", "2611617", "3697628", "4003185", "6337667", "7260542", "753469", "963397", "5491923"], "inbound_citations": ["31346670", "29686801", "28503229", "26765476", "25369726", "27201339", "24859757", "24346963", "24141437", "23452071", "23869267", "22374635", "15524493", "22453693", "21412822", "20573443", "19889062"], "label": "1"}

Few trials have evaluated the effect of PFM training on symptoms of overactive bladder. Most studies are flawed because they include several diagnoses and treatment modalities in the same intervention. Because of the lack of evidence, no firm conclusion can be drawn on the effect of PFM exercise on overactive bladder.

It has been suggested that the biotransformation of oxybutynin is dependent on CYP3A. Because itraconazole, a widely used mycotic, is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, we wanted to study a possible interaction between oxybutynin and itraconazole. In this double-blind, randomized, two-phase cross-over study, ten healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo for 4 days. On day 4, each volunteer ingested a single dose of 5 mg oxybutynin. Serum concentrations of oxybutynin, its active metabolite N-desethyloxybutynin, and itraconazole were monitored over 24 h. Itraconazole significantly increased both the area under the serum drug concentration-time curve (AUC0-t) and the peak concentration of oxybutynin twofold. The AUC0-t and the peak concentration of N-desethyloxybutynin were not significantly affected by itraconazole. Itraconazole did not change the peak time or the elimination half-life of either oxybutynin or N-desethyloxybutynin. The occurrence of adverse events after oxybutynin administration was not increased by itraconazole. Itraconazole moderately increases serum concentrations of oxybutynin, probably by inhibiting the CYP3A-mediated metabolism. However, the concentrations of N-desethyloxybutynin were practically unchanged. Since about 90% of the antimuscarinic activity of oxybutynin is attributable to N-desethyloxybutynin, any interaction of oxybutynin with CYP3A4 inhibiting drugs has only minor clinical significance.", "outbound_citations": ["9129558", "8689812", "8612379", "7995001", "8198928", "8453848", "8213879", "1455904", "1964163", "2851597", "6496110", "7295876"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

They were characterized as extensive metabolizers (EM1 with one functional CYP2D6 gene, EM2 with two functional genes) or poor metabolizers (PM).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNine patients, three EM2 and four EM1 and two PM, completed the trial. Following tolterodine administration, the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of tolterodine was 4.4-times and 30-times higher among EM1 and PM, respectively, compared with EM2. The AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-HM) was not quantifiable in PM. Fluoxetine significantly decreased (P<0.002) the oral clearance of tolterodine by 93% in EM2 and by 80% in EM1. The AUC of 5-HM increased in EM2 and decreased in EM1. However, the exposure to the active moiety (unbound tolterodine +5-HM) was not significantly increased in the two phenotypes. The subdivision of the EM group showed a 2.1-fold increase in active moiety in EM2 but the exposure was still similar to EM1 compared with before the interaction.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe study suggests a difference in the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine and its 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite depending on the number of functional CYP2D6 genes.

CYP27A has been extensively studied, but its role as a physiologically important vitamin D(3) 25-hydroxylase has been questioned. The present paper reports that the microsomal vitamin D(3) 25-hydroxylase, purified from pig liver, converted vitamin D(3) into 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) in substrate concentrations which are within the physiological range (apparent K(m) = 0.1 microm). The enzyme 25-hydroxylated vitamin D(3), 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D(3) and vitamin D(2) and also converted tolterodine, a substrate for human CYP2D6, into its 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Tolterodine inhibited the microsomal 25-hydroxylation, whereas quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, did not markedly inhibit the reaction. The primary structure of the microsomal vitamin D(3) 25-hydroxylase, designated CYP2D25, shows 77% identity with that of human CYP2D6. Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that CYP2D25 mRNA is expressed in higher levels in liver than in kidney and in small amounts in adrenals, brain, heart, intestine, lung, muscle, spleen, and thymus. Experiments with human liver microsomes and recombinantly expressed CYP2D6 strongly indicate that the microsomal 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D(3) in human liver is catalyzed by an enzyme different from CYP2D6.", "outbound_citations": ["9799568", "9790574", "9614081", "9555068", "9560305", "9531513", "9425298", "9405237", "9210654", "8694864", "7937829", "7947356", "7690968", "8392332", "1445236", "1730627", "1537465", "1912325", "2175615", "2169238", "2318307", "2722778", "2845922", "2844144", "3026027", "3745145", "2863108", "6469991", "6423637", "6304056", "6350405", "821951", "5432063"], "inbound_citations": ["37196753", "35728355", "35739987", "33659951", "32972010", "32837681", "31934161", "29719203", "29508210", "29308715", "28188842", "28868163", "28167281", "28214921", "27884721", "26652678", "24529992", "24106283", "22310641", "23179779"], "label": "0"}

Affinity estimates (pKB values) were calculated for the antagonists and correlated with values at the cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes quoted in the literature. 3 Pirenzepine, methoctramine and tropicamide drugs that have high affinities at M1, M2 and M4-receptors, respectively, all had low affinities on the human detrusor (pKB values of 6.8, 6.9 and 6.5, respectively), whilst the M3-selective antagonist 4-DAMP had a high affinity (9.5). Schild plots for all four antagonists had slopes of unity indicating an action at a single receptor. Oxybutynin and tolterodine also acted as competitive antagonists with affinity estimates of 7.6 and 8.1, respectively. 4 When the antagonist affinities obtained on the bladder were plotted against the values published for these antagonists at the cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes, the best correlations were obtained for the m3- and m5-muscarinic receptor subtypes. 5 These data suggest that direct contractile responses of the human detrusor muscle to muscarinic receptor stimulation in vitro are mediated solely via the M3-muscarinic receptor subtype with no contribution from the major M2-receptor population.", "outbound_citations": ["11090124", "11193006", "10385263", "10494124", "9647869", "9631949", "9113359", "8996405", "8709348", "8564260", "7752101", "8016895", "8401923", "1930292", "1994002", "2250662", "3690205", "4027512", "13651579"], "inbound_citations": ["36879156", "36479677", "35469847", "34723090", "34244231", "33567116", "32609936", "32563054", "28437032", "27443047", "27101440", "26459574", "26654844", "26904412", "26004864", "25948731", "26084660", "24899225", "24978084", "24628015", "24987007", "24122009", "24363860", "23885696", "24348420", "23662859", "23703523", "24705159", "23171069", "23374672", "22994938", "22789737", "22883779", "22390261", "22782192", "22745902", "22222707", "15230638", "22001099", "22003476", "21459965", "21282591", "21293089", "20955901", "20846201", "20801529", "20590605"], "label": "0"}

All presented with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI). Twenty were female of whom 8 also had enuresis and daytime symptoms. Ten had bilateral VUR, making a total of 34 units. Mean follow-up was 40 months (range 18-97 months) and at least 2 UD studies were done. Treatment consisted of oxybutinin chloride (OC) and chemoprophylaxis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment lasted an average of 31 months with an average dose of 11 mg/day. There was a statistically significant improvement in UTI rate, enuresis score and UD parameters [CysCap, volume at 1st contraction, maximum contraction and compliance (comp)]. Thirteen patients achieved stable bladders and 9 had some UD improvement (3 with low compliance and 2 with less severe DI), leaving 2 with unchanged DI. Reflux disappeared in 20 units and was downgraded in 6. VUR improvement coincided with the cases of UD improvement. Persistence of DI was always associated with persistent VUR.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOxybutinin treatment can be long, but UD and VUR improvement run parallel in most cases. The rare discrepant cases point towards a multifactorial ethology in this condition.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Sixteen female patients with large cystoceles did not demonstrate stress urinary incontinence on clinical examination and were included in this study. Additionally, 10 healthy female volunteers underwent the same test to study the effect of a vaginal pack on urethral dynamics. The vaginal pack revealed the presence of stress urinary incontinence in 11 patients (69%): 3 (19%) with type II (vesicourethral hypermobility) and 8 (50%) with type III (internal sphincteric deficiency). After insertion of the vaginal pack, urodynamic studies showed that the closing proximal urethral pressure in patients with stress urinary incontinence was significantly lower than in continent patients (p < 0.05). No significant change in urethral pressures was noted in volunteer subjects after vaginal pack insertion. Fluoroscopy showed kinking of the posterior urethra and enlargement of the most dependent portion of the cystocele, that is the lower half of the hourglass image. Our study suggests that the mechanisms of continence in these patients are multifactorial, including urethral kinking, urethral compression and pressure dissipation. The vaginal pack test is easy to perform, increases visualization of the vesicourethral unit when used with fluoroscopy, and can aid in the selection of patients who would benefit from anti-incontinence surgery and/or cystocele repair.", "outbound_citations": ["1553172", "1895456", "2033695", "1842676", "2520812", "3369501", "6887424", "6683932", "943076"], "inbound_citations": ["34215810", "31089759", "29872900", "28967822", "27999934", "28913059", "25754989", "25063597", "24819329", "24411129", "24183347", "12054190", "22581237", "22527558", "21330216", "21219445", "21475069", "22453344"], "label": "0"}

The proposed mechanism of action is the induction of GA-specific T cells characterized by protective anti-inflammatory Th2 response. We tested this hypothesis in 11 MS patients treated with GA from 1-19 months. Interferon-g and IL-5 (markers of Th1 and Th2 responses respectively) were assayed by ELISA in GA-specific T-cell lines (TCL) supernatants. Th1/Th2 bias was defined based on the ratio of IFN-\u03b3/IL-5 secretion. Fifty-eight pre-treatment, and 75 on-treatment GA-specific TCL were generated. On-treatment mean IL-5 levels in GA-TCL increased significantly, whereas those for IFN-g were markedly reduced. Consequently, the ratio of IFN-\u03b3/IL-5 also shifted in favor of a Th2 response. The percentage of GA-TCL classified as Th1 was decreased, whereas those classified as Th2 increased on-treatment as compared to pre-treatment. Some GA-specific TCL, (approximately 25%) generated during treatment secreted predominantly IL-5 in response to MBP and the immunodominant MBP peptide 83-99, indicating that these crossreactive antigens can act as partial agonists for GA-reactive TCL. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of GA in MS involves the induction of crossreactive GA-specific T cells with a predominant Th2 cytokine profile.", "outbound_citations": ["11288751", "11113226", "11027347", "10900354", "10861011", "10749576", "10097037", "9892685", "9916886", "9846830", "9637491", "9521260", "9574543", "9380718", "9237101", "9103439", "9143690", "8921948", "8632064", "7584131", "11902590", "7515181", "8419168", "1371525", "1370347", "1717632", "1714060", "2462252", "3302705", "2417162", "2415875", "2410914", "6199466", "1047003", "4141659", "5157960"], "inbound_citations": ["36986586", "35211120", "33537031", "32093011", "31354720", "31397433", "30414463", "31156238", "27390072", "25458968", "24938888", "24129744", "23609780", "23469939", "22982294", "22449210", "20687620", "23070731", "22091596", "29939403", "21402415", "21476611", "21371758", "20951177", "20969865", "17920545", "20687779", "20806993", "20362388", "20464733", "22069614", "20163265"], "label": "0"}

According to preoperative bladder behaviour, 59 patients (46.5%) presented voiding disorders, 10 (7.9%) filling disorders, 4 (3.1%) mixed disorders, whereas 54 (42.5%) were asymptomatic. The urethral catheter was removed between the 10th and the 12th postoperative day. Fourteen patients entered a programme of early sexual rehabilitation with intracavernous injection of prostaglandin E1 (ICI) within 7 days from catheter removal.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter catheter removal the recovery of urinary continence occurred within 2.2 +/- 2.3 days. At dismissal from the hospital, 8 patients (6.2%) were almost totally incontinent; 2 (1.5%) were still incontinent after a 6-month period; 73 (57.4%) were dismissed with clinical signs of detrusor instability hence treated with anticholinergic drugs such oxybutynin or tolterodine; 3 (2.3%) resulted obstructed after surgery because of stenosis of the anastomosis. Almost all the patients submitted to early sexual rehabilitation referred an improvement of their incontinence after the first injection. The patients who did not begin an early sexual rehabilitation generally recovered from incontinence in a longer time.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur preliminary observations showed that artificial erection PGE1-induced is effective in improving or accelerating post radical prostatectomy incontinence recovery.

A comparison of cure rates between biofeedback training and pelvic floor exercise groups demonstrated that there were significant differences in objective changes: detrusor pressure (68.75% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), compliance (75.0% vs. 6.67%, p < 0.001), and resting maximal urethral closure pressure (43.75% vs. 6.67%, p < 0.037). Neither the cure rate nor improvement rate of subjective changes (urgency, and frequency and episodes of urge incontinence), significantly differed.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOxybutynin chloride was not well tolerated while bladder-sphincter-biofeedback was well accepted.

Methods: For enuresis type I, the change in the awakening response during the conditioning treatment with a therapeutic machine was observed. For enuresis type IIa, the effect of imipramine on the EEG was observed. For enuresis type IIb, the effect of oxybutynin hydrochloride on the cystometrogram (CMG) was observed. Results: Values, in which the awakening score on the second night was subtracted from the score on the last night, were significantly higher in the effective cases than in the unchanged cases. Out of the 3 patients in whom imipramine was effective, an awakening response on the EEG was observed in 2. Neither of the 2 unchanged cases showed an awakening response. Out of 4 patients in whom oxybutynin hydrochloride was effective, uninhibited contractions (UIC) on the CMG disappeared in 3. UIC stopped in neither of the 2 unchanged cases. Conclusions: Improvement of the awakening response plays an important role in the effectiveness of conditioning treatment with our therapeutic machine. The generation of awakening response is thought to be the most important result of imipramine directly concerned with its clinical effect on enuresis type IIa. The main result with oxybutynin hydrochloride in enuresis type IIb is thought to be related to its antispasmodic effect.", "outbound_citations": ["8307075", "8503326", "2740698", "3816999", "322182", "235500", "14446575"], "inbound_citations": ["31790860", "23881652"], "label": "0"}

Oxybutynin metabolism occurs primarily in the proximal gastrointestinal tract and the hepatic circulation and is mediated by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme. The major degradation products are desethyloxybutynin, which possesses pharmacological activity, and phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is metabolically inert. A major limitation to long-term compliance with immediate-release oxybutynin remains the necessity for twice- or thrice-daily dosing regimens to provide sustained pharmacological efficacy. Side effects induced by cytochrome P450 metabolism of oxybutynin into the primary metabolite desethyloxybutynin within the gut wall substantially affect the tolerability of the compound within the individual. The oral osmotic delivery system provides unique advantages for drug delivery and substantially alters the tolerability profile of the oxybutynin chloride compound. This extended-release formulation consists of a two component core encapsulated by a semi-permeable membrane. The osmotic gradient between the surrounding environment and the inner core of the delivery system remains constant and water absorption within the capsule is controlled by the semipermeable membrane causing a controlled release of drug, which is sustained over 24 h. Herein are reviewed the various pre- and post-approval trials which have documented the overall therapeutic index of the oral osmotic oxybutynin (Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals). Subsequent post-market surveillance issues are reviewed as are new developments in oxybutynin delivery.", "outbound_citations": ["7875185", "3234461", "11678784", "11483904", "11394733", "11322350", "11210400", "11011985", "10792154", "10775736", "11067391", "10458442", "10332441", "10391673", "10073329", "9720583", "9775412", "9434659", "9883934", "9307522", "9426760", "9400033", "9402781", "9258982", "9072550", "8835047", "7620236", "8575504", "1640530", "1455904", "1993995", "2181492", "2566693", "2849672", "2442425", "2881993", "7295876"], "inbound_citations": ["23669567"], "label": "1"}

Multiple blood and saliva samples were collected. Pharmacokinetic parameters and total salivary output were assessed. Statistical analyses included 95% confidence intervals, paired t test, analysis of variance, and linear regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSteady-state plasma concentrations were achieved after the first transdermal application and after the second extended-release oral dose. Mean +/- SD 24-hour oxybutynin areas under the concentration-time curve were comparable during transdermal and oral extended-release treatments, 10.8 +/- 24 vs 9.2 +/- 33 ng x h(-1) x mL(-1), respectively. However, the ratio of area under the curve (N-desethyloxybutynin/oxybutynin) after transdermal administration (1.2 +/- 03) was significantly lower (P < .001) than after extended-release oral administration (4.1 +/- 0.9). Mean plasma concentrations were less variable during transdermal compared with extended-release oral administration. Mean +/- SD saliva output was greater during transdermal than extended-release oral treatment (15.7 +/- 93 vs 12.2 +/- 6.8 g, respectively; P = .02). Lower N-desethyloxybutynin during transdermal application was associated with greater saliva output (r = -059, P = .04). No clinically important treatment-related adverse effects were observed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTransdermal oxybutynin administration results in greater systemic availability and minimizes metabolism to N-desethyloxybutynin compared with extended-release oral administration. Lower N-desethyloxybutynin plasma concentration and greater saliva output during transdermal treatment correspond to the reported low incidence of dry mouth in patients with overactive bladder.", "outbound_citations": ["11496941", "12608543", "3234461", "12131314", "12031395", "12002352", "11678784", "11435842", "11394733", "10073329", "9825119", "9720583", "9072550", "1640530", "2005707", "1993995", "2023781", "2249115", "2198921", "2667633", "3227053", "6370504"], "inbound_citations": ["36815245", "33368382", "32884926", "32485225", "31326435", "30686806", "27787745", "27619779", "27034721", "25782032", "24133005", "23885696", "23543139", "22927031", "22909146", "22293119", "22258963", "22293119", "19275276", "24198634", "21290231", "21721591", "24198618", "20425098"], "label": "0"}

Results of recent clinical trials demonstrate differences in tolerance between antimuscarinic drugs. It is the purpose of this paper to relate the available clinical data to the pharmacological and physicochemical properties of the different antimuscarinic drugs, in order to discuss the reasons for this enhanced tolerance and to make possible modes for improvement of antimuscarinic therapy plainly visible.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTherefore, we reviewed the available literature using among others the computerized library systems Medline (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and Embase (Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Differences in tolerance of oral antimuscarinic drugs may result from muscarine-receptor selectivity, organ selectivity, and pharmacokinetic as well as physicochemical properties. While the roles of m-receptor and organ selectivity need more detailed clarification, influences of differences in bioavailability and physicochemical properties on the tolerance of antimuscarinic drugs are more sufficiently investigated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGenerally, tolerance as well as efficacy of antimuscarinic drugs seem to be a complex result of a combination of various pharmacological properties distinguishing the individual substances. The enhancement of tolerance of propiverine hydrochloride, tolterodine tartrate and trospium chloride compared to oxybutynin chloride seems to be reached by different modes, from which the molecular structure -- propiverine and tolterodine are tertiary amines, trospium chloride possesses a quarternary ammonium structure -- may be of great importance. First investigations with alternative transdermal and intravesical application routes show interesting possibilities for further improvement of antimuscarinic therapy in urological indications.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, from pharmacological and clinical data it becomes obvious that there are significant differences between antimuscarinic drugs, which are of clinical relevance and include possible starting points for the development of new drugs and application forms.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33017894", "28066140", "25273389", "25047051", "23800037", "22871042", "15482001"], "label": "1"}

We reviewed the magnitude and impact of these conditions, and discuss pharmacotherapy as well as new drugs under investigation. The main emphasis of this review is pharmacological therapy for the bladder. We discuss currently available agents, drugs under development and pharmacological targets that would be suitable targets for treating overactive bladder. Drugs such as duloxetine that target not bladder smooth muscle, but rather central nervous system control of the micturition reflex are undergoing clinical trials. We also discuss intravesical therapy and alternative drug delivery methods, such as intravesical capsaicin and botulinum toxin, with special emphasis on approaches to modulate bladder afferent nerve function for preventing overactive bladder. There are many advantages to advanced drug delivery systems, including long-term therapeutic efficacy, decreased side effects and improved patient compliance. Future speculation such as gene therapy holds great promise for overactive bladder because it is possible to access all genitourinary organs via endoscopy and other minimally invasive techniques that are ideally suited for gene therapy. Traditional anticholinergic therapies are limited in their effectiveness. There is great hope for future research regarding voiding dysfunction and urinary incontinence through a focus on afferent nerve intervention for preventing overactive bladder.", "outbound_citations": ["9228673", "1143357", "16985657", "11978143", "11743296", "11760781", "11549755", "11676195", "11490313", "11466438", "11435842", "11425638", "11342969", "11294762", "11294761", "11322350", "11306423", "11257648", "11248608", "11264473", "11125424", "11125423", "11125419", "11135387", "11409613", "11294534", "11069181", "11501613", "10953127", "10944224", "10924932", "10928975", "10893580", "10799247", "10792154", "10767450", "10775736", "10832609", "10699610", "10755330", "10664922", "11071699", "10604366", "10532986", "10510109", "10379728", "10332441", "10391673", "10073329", "10027879", "10188996", "10069504", "10379788", "10599411", "10543335", "9817340", "9825837", "9756570", "9749464", "9786494", "9755289", "29586049", "29591552", "9732827", "9655864", "9666761", "9647486", "9579721", "9510336", "9556190", "9519799", "9494998", "9494997", "9511769", "9825395", "9426760", "9366318", "9426756", "9426752", "9349813", "9288055", "9272723", "9112532", "9113359", "9179682", "11725141", "8996387", "8996364", "8996179", "9029489", "8981565", "8808907", "8709348", "8683776", "8862715", "8963976", "8851518", "8696352", "8595084", "7658588", "8578271", "7544120", "7636716", "7752101", "7788255", "7723960", "7620236", "7604457", "8834001", "8771269", "7869058", "7812599", "7957606", "8126787", "8126833", "8015832", "8281402", "8248281", "8101362", "8516987", "8098860", "1535127", "1861294", "1676929", "2005707", "2023781", "1771701", "2087011", "2249117", "2211099", "2213039", "2170793", "2297305", "2724432", "2521514", "3361663", "3132651", "3339764", "3959249", "3899664", "6481641", "6349743", "6296468", "790746", "4514388", "4907278", "4880295"], "inbound_citations": ["37024405", "36986471", "36180322", "36134837", "33401353", "33118417", "33129871", "32282255", "32063862", "31842248", "30852882", "31482020", "31066800", "28150436", "28260223", "28489120", "26153085", "26391191", "26351600", "26081949", "25773663", "25200037", "24014261", "24747752", "25001574", "24824147", "24527221", "23832777", "24669123", "24035037", "24152577", "24167769", "24078498", "23731765", "23660224", "22134010", "22951005", "22341128", "22647456", "22309784", "21729234", "15482001", "22654715", "20661957", "21367919", "20860017", "19751985", "26676284", "19592069", "20414394"], "label": "0"}

Potential CNS targets include GABA, opioid, serotonin (5-HT), dopamine and glutaminergic receptors as well as the \u03b1-adrenoceptors. Potential PNS targets include muscarinic receptors, calcium and potassium channels and \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Since acetylcholine is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter involved in bladder (detrusor) contraction and emptying, anticholinergic agents are the primary compounds used clinically to decrease involuntary detrusor contractions. Anticholinergic therapy has a stabilising effect on the bladder (detrusor muscle); increases bladder capacity; decreases frequency of involuntary detrusor contractions; and delays the initial urge to void, but does not affect warning time. However, the clinical utility of antimuscarinic therapy is limited by the lack of receptor selectivity, resulting in the classic anticholinergic side effects of dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and potentially, CNS effects such as somnolence and impaired cognitive function. These unwanted side effects often result in premature discontinuation of therapy and poor compliance. Previous attempts to develop uroselective \u03b1-adrenergic receptor antagonists have not been successful and although research continues, the hope that this class of agents would be viable alternatives to the anticholinergics remains to be proven in the clinical setting. The recent demise of several potassium channel openers does not augur well for the future of this class of agent. The reasons for the discontinuation of trials with these agents have not been fully elucidated, but one must assume that they were not uroselective and the cardiovascular side effects rendered them less than useful clinically. The serotonin re-uptake inhibitors appear to be promising novel therapeutic agents aimed at controlling bladder over-activity through specific CNS pathways. The sensory side of the micturition reflex is a potential therapeutic target. Agents to desensitise afferent nerve endings involved in C-fibre afferent reflexes include capsaicin and resiniferatoxin. Their clinical applicability is currently being evaluated. Finally, the recent findings related to the role of the P2X3 receptor in the sensory aspects of bladder filling have created new interest in the future development of agents that will improve the management of this prevalent and debilitating condition.", "outbound_citations": ["11204266", "11069181", "10767450", "10664922", "10604385", "10571617", "10454502", "10428387", "10393481", "10073329", "10210605", "10069502", "10081718", "10393466", "10393471", "10393478", "9775416", "9734316", "9748713", "9671109", "9638316", "9495728", "9495736", "9500159", "9200560", "9121347", "9426760", "9426752", "9347324", "9256331", "9203938", "9151307", "9113359", "8996407", "9079239", "8996408", "9079238", "9353802", "9426749", "8709348", "8627548", "8592129", "8564260", "7557266", "8528547", "7544120", "7636752", "7636716", "7568338", "7752101", "7788255", "7742166", "7716258", "8750383", "8248281", "1942288", "1677700", "1926674", "1771701", "2313821", "1701681", "2849672", "2850421", "2872987", "696340", "625755"], "inbound_citations": ["35086595", "32334500", "27101440", "26613061", "24258099", "23372610", "22691178", "23026705", "22626580", "22691895", "22491716", "21142693", "21361152", "22453613"], "label": "0"}

Indications included unavailability or unsuitability of the appendix, preference for appendix as a catheterizable colonic stoma for antegrade washouts or concomitant removal of a nonfunctioning kidney, leaving the ureter available for use. Surgical technique was based on the principles of appendicovesicostomy and in 9 cases the ureteral Mitrofanoff channel was reimplanted. Followup ranged from 1 to 72 months (average 30.5). Complications included stenosis of the conduit that caused difficult catheterization in 3 patients, necessitating dilation or minor revision in 2 and complete replacement by appendix in 1. Urinary leakage from the Mitrofanoff channel in 5 patients was treated with polydimethylsiloxane injection or oxybutinin. In 1 patient the channel was reimplanted, since the catheter struck the bladder neck during catheterization and caused severe pain.

Several different pharmacological actions are potentially useful depending on the underlying cause of the incontinence: a) Detrusor instability (DI) responds to drugs reducing bladder contractility: Anticholinergic agents, e.g. oxybutynin and tolterodine, act at postganglionic parasympathetic cholinergic receptor sites on the detrusor muscle, reducing the strength of the detrusor contraction. Tricyclic antidepressants, e.g. imipramine, have anticholinergic effects, block presynaptic uptake of amine neurotransmitters and directly inhibit detrusor muscle. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists may have a role to play by dual actions on bladder overactivity (due to altered receptor function) and by reducing outlet resistance. b) Genuine stress incontinence (GSI) may be treated using alpha-adrenergic agonists, e.g. phenylpropanolamine, to increase outlet resistance by stimulating smooth muscle of the urethra and bladder neck. c) In nocturnal enuresis reduction of nocturnal urine output with the anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) analogue DDAVP (1-deamino, 8-arginine vasopressin) is beneficial. d) Bladder emptying may be facilitated in patients with retention and \u2018overflow\u2019 incontinence by alpha-adrenergic antagonists, which reduce outlet resistance, and perhaps by parasympathomimetics, e.g. bethanecol. e) In postmenopausal women, systemic oestrogen replacement reduces filling symptoms including urge incontinence. Evidence for oestrogen replacement alone in GSI is lacking, but combination with alpha-agonists is beneficial in milder GSI.For the future, tolterodine and other new anticholinergics offer the hope of treatment for DI with fewer of the side effects that limit the use of established drugs. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of DI may provide new targets for drug therapy, such as hyperpolarisation of detrusor muscle membrane.

An extended-release (ER) formulation of oxybutynin based on the OROS system has recently become available, which allows once daily administration. In direct comparison to oxybutynin IR, oxybutynin ER has an increased oral bioavailability for the parent compound oxybutynin which is accompanied by a reduced bioavailability for the active metabolite N-desethyl-oxybutynin. The latter has been implicated in mediating a major part of the adverse effects of oxybutynin treatment. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised studies in patients with overactive bladder have demonstrated that oxybutynin ER has a similar efficacy as oxybutynin IR but with improved tolerability. This is in line with clinical pharmacological studies demonstrating a smaller impairment of saliva production with oxybutynin ER than with oxybutynin IR.

CASES We describe three patients with hypoglycemia due to inadvertent (in two patients) and factitious (in one patient) sulfonylurea overdosages. We review the world literature and summarize 43 previously published cases of inadvertently administered and 23 previously published cases of factitiously self-administered sulfonylurea overdosages with hypoglycemia. RESULTS An inadvertently administered fulsonylurea overdosage usually occurred when a sulfonylurea was accidentally substituted for an intended medication with a similar generic or trade name. Features of the patients with a factitiously self-administered sulfonylurea overdosage included: 1) a history of the patient or patient's spouse having a medical job or sulfonylurea-treated diabetes mellitus; 2) an unusual affect or psychiatric history; 3) an abrupt onset of severe symptoms without previous milder symptoms; and 4) an absent hypoglycemic or hyperinsulinemic response to provocative testing. These features are not typical for an insulinoma. CONCLUSIONS When a hypoglycemic patient denies antidiabetic medication use, we recommend sequentially performing: 1) a thorough pill inspection; 2) an interview for recently altered pill appearances; 3) a measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide levels during hypoglycemia; and 4) a blood or urine sulfonylurea screen. Discovery of an unreported sulfonylurea overdosage can eliminate the need to search for an insulinoma and prevent further overdosages from occurring.", "outbound_citations": ["8357069", "1400666", "1644868", "1571863", "1909521", "1684067", "1677058", "1900850", "2008778", "1812647", "2119566", "2118693", "2180287", "2504124", "2729301", "3400706", "2841080", "3276184", "3036449", "3796700", "3096471", "3944570", "6864931", "6409573", "6802358", "6250435", "910864", "190959", "803250", "4843202", "5038906", "5007076", "5089144", "6059656", "13724974", "14368253"], "inbound_citations": ["36210202", "35642661", "35602882", "30195058", "23149376", "23266564", "22767115", "22277726"], "label": "0"}

After baseline measurements, participants converting from conventional oxybutynin started Ditropan XL at their previous oxybutynin dose; others started at 5 mg/day. Doses were adjusted until participants reached a maintenance dose that produced continence or the best balance between continence and side effects. This dose was continued for 12 weeks. Effectiveness was assessed by urinary diaries.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEffectiveness was achieved across all doses studied (5 to 30 mg/day), with 70.8% of participants using maintenance doses of 5 to 15 mg/day. Mean urge incontinence episodes per week decreased from 18.8 at baseline to 3.9 in maintenance week 1, 2.7 in week 4, and 2.8 at the end of the study. For those participants who reported urge incontinence episodes at baseline but were free of urge incontinence at maintenance week 1, 31% remained free of urge incontinence at every subsequent assessment. Participants who converted from other medications showed symptomatic improvement after conversion.

Affinity estimates were obtained for several muscarinic antagonists against carbachol-stimulated [3H]-inositol phosphates accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-KI) cells stably expressing either human muscarinic M3 or M5 receptor subtypes. The rationale for these studies was to generate a functional antagonist affinity profile for the M5 receptor subtype and compare this with that of the M3 receptor, in order to identify compounds which discriminate between these two subtypes. 2. The rank order of antagonist apparent affinities (pK(B)) at the muscarinic M5 receptor was atropine (8.7) > or =tolterodine (8.6) = 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP, 8.6)> darifenacin (7.7) > or =zamifenacin (7.6)>oxybutynin (6.6)= para-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol (p-F-HHSiD, 6.6)>pirenzepine (6.4) > or = methoctramine (6.3)=himbacine (6.3)>AQ-RA 741 (6.1). 3. Antagonist apparent affinities for both receptor subtypes compare well with published binding affinity estimates. No antagonist displayed greater selectivity for the muscarinic M5 subtype over the M3 subtype, but himbacine, AQ-RA 741, p-F-HHSiD, darifenacin and oxybutynin displayed between 9- and 60 fold greater selectivity for the muscarinic M3 over the M5 subtype. 4. This study highlights the similarity in pharmacological profiles of M3 and M5 receptor subtypes and identifies five antagonists that may represent useful tools for discriminating between these two subtypes.

Thirteen healthy female volunteers received three 5 mg OROS\u00ae oxybutynin chloride tablets once daily for 4 days or IR oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours for 4 days. On day 1, with OROS\u00ae oxybutynin chloride, mean plasma concentrations rose slowly over approximately 6 hours following dosing (mean Cmax 4.2 ng/mL) and remained fairly constant over the 24\u2010hour dosing interval, whereas with IR oxybutynin, mean plasma concentrations rose rapidly within the first hour after dosing (mean Cmax 12.0 ng/mL), then declined. The mean oxybutynin degree of fluctuation was much lower for OROS\u00ae oxybutynin chloride (78%) than for IR oxybutynin (371%). For both formulations, the plasma concentration\u2010time profiles for the metabolite N\u2010desethyloxybutynin paralleled those of oxybutynin but at higher concentrations. Steady\u2010state oxybutynin concentrations were achieved by day 3 for both formulations. Mean area under the concentration\u2010time curve (AUC) values for both oxybutynin and its metabolite were similar between day 1 and day 4 for each treatment, suggesting time\u2010invariant pharmacokinetics. With OROS\u00ae oxybutynin chloride, mean relative bioavailability was higher (153%) for oxybutynin and lower (69%) for N\u2010desethyloxybutynin compared with IR oxybutynin. This increased bioavailability may be due to reduced first\u2010pass metabolism; within 3 to 5 hours after dosing, OROS\u00ae systems are thought to reach the colon, where cytochrome P450\u2010mediated oxidation (oxybutynin's primary metabolic pathway) may be less extensive than in the small intestine.

Alternatively, our patient may have had aberrant metabolism of this drug or an increased sensitivity as a result of incipient Alzheimer disease.", "outbound_citations": ["8789616", "1208760", "11835370", "11483904", "11402632", "11454106", "11342895", "11392625", "11248608", "11258042", "11134384", "10223495", "10210394", "9646152", "9434659", "9426760", "9475612", "9158579", "1480682", "3178177", "3579494", "2938571", "4063793", "4359364"], "inbound_citations": ["36548636", "32183741", "31373245", "28384267", "27882548", "26169438", "25092795", "25238744", "26663594", "24363860", "23098785", "25877263", "22390261", "22070184", "22222707", "21607875", "21468739", "21293089", "20809661", "20561092", "20877608"], "label": "0"}

Treatment consisted of three doses per day over a 2 week period, with either Oxy (5 mg three times daily) or with TCl (20 mg twice daily) with an additional placebo at midday. The results were evaluated with regard to changes in objective (urodynamic) data and subjective symptoms as well as the incidence/severity of adverse effects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWith both drugs there was a significant increase in maximum bladder capacity, a significant decrease in maximum voiding detrusor pressure and a significant increase in compliance and residual urine; there were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups. The percentage of patients who reported severe dryness of the mouth was considerably lower (4%) in those receiving TCl 2 x 20 mg/day than in those receiving Oxy (23%) 3 x 5 mg/day. Withdrawal from treatment was also less frequent in those receiving TCl (6%) than in those receiving Oxy (16%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTrospium chloride and oxybutynin, judged in terms of objective urodynamic parameters, are of substantially equal value as parasympathetic antagonists.

Twenty-five patients (mean age 36. 7 years) with storage pressures greater than 40 cm H(2)O despite standard anticholinergic treatment received intravesical (15 mg three times daily) and oral oxybutynin chloride treatment. The follow-up evaluations included urodynamic testing, renal ultrasound, urine examination (urinalysis and urine culture), and evaluation of side effects. The mean follow-up was 6 months. Intravesical treatment led to an increase in bladder storage volume from 349 to 420 mL. The mean maximum storage pressure was significantly reduced from 54 to 26.5 cm H(2)O. Detrusor storage pressures returned to values less than 40 cm H(2)O in 21 of 25 patients. Dysreflexia was treated successfully in 3 of 5 patients. No patient developed renal damage. No severe side effects or drug-related discontinuation of treatment were observed.

Both age and gender affect bladder function, and incontinence affects females and males in a ratio of 2:1. Incontinence can be classified as urge, stress, overflow, functional, or mixed. There are many reversible causes of incontinence, and a thorough history and physical examination, including a complete voiding history and a tailored neuro-urologic examination, are required for accurate diagnosis. Treatment options include behavioral modification, medical therapy with anticholinergics or hormone replacement, and surgical intervention.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUrinary incontinence, due to many causes, is a widespread problem among the elderly. Yet many of these causes are reversible with appropriate treatment, often by the primary care provider.

After a 2-week run-in period (visit 1), the patients were started on tolterodine 1 mg twice a day (bid) (visit 2). They were followed at 4 and 8 weeks (visits 3 and 4). The patients were contacted by telephone 1 week after visit 2. Tolterodine was increased to 2 mg bid if the patient had incomplete improvement at either the initial phone call or during visit 3. Evaluation criteria were daily micturition charts including urinary frequency, nocturia, leakage episodes, average urine volume per day, and average voided volume. Tolterodine was well tolerated without side effects in 20 (80%) of 28 patients. Eight patients (20%) dropped out after enrollment because of side effects in 3, no improvement in 2, and missing visits (>1) in 3. Drug dosage in the 20 patients who tolerated tolterodine was 1 mg bid in 3 and 2 mg bid in 17 (85%). According to micturition charts, urinary frequency, nocturia, and leakage episodes decreased significantly after tolterodine treatment, whereas average urine volume per day and average voided volume did not change significantly. There were no electrocardiographic or biochemical abnormalities due to tolterodine treatment. Mean follow-up was 9.4 months. All 20 patients who tolerated tolterodine continue to take the medication without significant side effects. We conclude that tolterodine is well tolerated and effective for overactive bladders. Two milligrams bid is the dosage preferred by the majority of patients and the onset of action is seen within 1 week of treatment.

Previous surgery was performed in 18 patients, including bladder neck reconstruction in 15 and bladder augmentation in 9. Mean patient age at injection was 13 years (range 7 to 17). We administered 1, 2 and 3 injections in 21, 11 and 1 patients, respectively. Mean volume at each injection was 3.2 cc. Mean interval between injections was 6 months (range 3 to 15). In all cases injection was done transurethrally. Followup ranged from 6 to 41 months (median 16). A total of 11 patients (33.3%) are dry (continence for greater than 4 hours and no urinary pad use during the day) and 8 (24.2%) are improved (continence for 2 to 3 hours and minimal pad use). Results are poor in 14 cases. Overall previous bladder neck surgery or preoperative detrusor hyperactivity did not influence results. Good results were mainly associated with female gender (47.4% of girls versus 10.5% of boys achieved cure). Injection of polydimethylsiloxane at the bladder neck resulted in continence in 33% of neurogenic bladder cases. Better results occurred in girls and injection did not compromise other surgical procedures.

The mainstay of current pharmacological treatment involves use of muscarinic receptor antagonists, but their therapeutic efficacy is limited by their troublesome side effects resulting in the non-continuance of treatment in a significant number of patients. Therefore, the development of new drugs can proceed by targeting alternative pathways affecting detrusor overactivity. In this article, the pharmacological basis for the current therapeutic alternatives for managing detrusor overactivity and possible future developments are discussed. Recent findings It is clear that far from being a passive container for urine, the urothelium is a crucial part of the bladder. Its functions are complex, dynamic and important, and only now becoming understood. The release of ATP from urothelium in response to distension and its action on P2X receptors resulting in activating both motor and sensory neurons is being increasingly recognised. In the normal bladder, muscarinic receptor stimulation produces the main part of detrusor contraction. However, in functionally abnormal bladders, a non-cholinergic activation via the purinergic receptors may occur. The central nervous mechanisms controlling the micturition reflex have also recently attracted attention. Summary Recent research has suggested that several transmitters may modulate voiding. However, few drugs with clinical benefits have been developed so far. Present treatments for overactive bladders have significant non-compliance rates. Hopefully, future research will lead to drugs with greater therapeutic benefits and better tolerance.", "outbound_citations": ["12525852", "12187273", "11857671", "11743296", "12123469", "11412210", "11125417", "11090124", "11069181", "11025384", "10953127", "10944224", "10924932", "10893641", "11193006", "10737752", "10711338", "10612692", "10688600", "10571617", "10524944", "10458413", "10336534", "10386771", "10087049", "10188996", "10069506", "9791087", "29586049", "9628651", "9692772", "9453690", "9200560", "9423189", "9366319", "9426752", "9288055", "9251677", "9426749", "9444738", "8981565", "8851518", "8558714", "8595084", "7563383", "7501251", "7636752", "7609147", "7645157", "7752101", "7737309", "7516984", "8290592", "8248281", "7687078", "8382703", "7504306", "1640519", "1535127", "1653318", "2795743", "2832620", "3288903", "3727194", "6367811", "6864905", "6296468", "7147531", "7330612", "6110438", "30199", "13606", "971681"], "inbound_citations": ["36479677", "32869151", "31585112", "31346670", "29380517", "28906080", "25810148", "26644809", "26666524", "25491433", "24783434", "23424164", "23850394", "24047126", "23079373", "23471546", "23182126", "20590605", "20201752"], "label": "0"}

This well-defined and characterized data set provided an opportunity to detail more precisely adverse maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes in women who developed hypertension among a prospective series of healthy nulliparas. Of 4302 women observed to or beyond 20 weeks' gestation, 1073 (24.9%) developed mild or severe pregnancy-associated hypertension or preeclampsia. One hundred sixteen women of the 1073 with hypertension (10.8%) and 336 of the 3229 without hypertension (10.4%) were delivered before 37 weeks' gestation. Fetal and neonatal mortality were similar in those groups; however, selected maternal and newborn morbidities were significantly greater in women with hypertension. Significantly increased maternal morbidities included increased cesarean deliveries, abruptio placentae, and acute renal dysfunction; and significantly increased perinatal morbidities included respiratory distress syndrome, ventilatory support, and fetal growth restriction. Adverse outcomes were highest in women with severe pregnancy-associated hypertension or preeclampsia.

Participants who had between 7 and 50 episodes of urge incontinence per week and 10 or more voids in 24 hours received extended-release oxybutynin, 10 mg/d, or tolterodine, 2 mg twice daily.

At the end of the study, extended-release oxybutynin was significantly more effective than tolterodine in each of the main outcome measures: weekly urge incontinence (P=.03), total incontinence (P=.02), and micturition frequency episodes (P=.02) adjusted for baseline. Both drugs improved symptoms of overactive bladder significantly from baseline to the end of the study as assessed by the 3 main outcome measures (P<.001).

Dry mouth was the most common event, occurring in 12.9% of patients, and was generally mild in severity. Other adverse events occurred in less than 5% of patients. There was no increase in the frequency of adverse events with long-term relative to short-term treatment. The efficacy of tolterodine was maintained over the 12-month treatment period; relative to baseline there were reductions in the number of incontinence episodes per week (median change -83%) and micturitions per 24 hours (median change -21%) and an increase in volume voided (median change +25%) after 12 months' treatment. An improvement in patient perception of their bladder condition was found in 75% of patients completing the study, and 51% had an improvement in patient perception of urgency. Tolterodine ER 4mg qd displayed a favourable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile during 12 months' treatment of patients with overactive bladder.", "outbound_citations": ["12017406", "11402632", "11412210", "11374317", "11248608", "11482747", "11327200", "10534791", "10223495", "10543335", "9666761", "9883934", "9426760", "7620236", "8750383", "8248281", "2102668"], "inbound_citations": ["36303599", "28678587", "28097267", "26988624", "26488196", "26623152", "25861957", "26000514", "25369726", "25725183", "24666884", "24971138", "24567280", "23659987", "22536472", "22100006", "16903766", "22273813", "21830836", "21462240", "21599928", "21489081", "20569078", "20846201", "20201992"], "label": "1"}

The efficacy of oxybutynin in children has been limited by side effects. A new extended-release formulation of oxybutynin has some benefits versus traditional oxybutynin but has never been evaluated in children. A retrospective study was performed on 25 children who had been treated with extended-release oxybutynin. Fourteen had neurogenic bladder dysfunction and 11 had urinary frequency and urgency and urge incontinence but no neurologic abnormalities. Patients and families were asked to semiquantitatively (0 to 10 grading with 10 = severe) assess the effects of the medication on efficacy, as well as side effects and compliance with medication schedules. All 25 patients had improvement in incontinence and/or voiding dysfunction on extended-release oxybutynin. Twelve (48%) experienced no side effects. Of the 13 who did, 10 complained of dry mouth (grade 4.6 plus minus 0.5), 4 had constipation (grade 5.8 plus minus 1.8), 4 had heat intolerance (grade 5.1 plus minus 0.9), and 3 had drowsiness (grade 5.3 plus minus 2.4). Of patients previously treated with oxybutynin, the extended-release oxybutynin was equally or more efficacious and had the same or fewer side effects, especially less dry mouth. Families reported much better patient compliance with the medication regimen using extended-release oxybutynin compared with oxybutynin. Patient and family satisfaction was very high, and 21 of 25 have continued using the medication. Extended-release oxybutynin is safe and efficacious in children.

Despite short terminal disposition half\u2010lives of 2\u20133 and 3\u20134 hours for tolterodine and its active 5\u2010hydroxy metabolite, respectively, twice/day dosing is effective due to the drug's prolonged pharmacodynamic effects. Dosage adjustment is recommended in the presence of hepatic impairment and during concurrent therapy with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4 isozymes. Tolterodine significantly reduces clinically relevant end points such as number of micturitions and number of incontinence episodes/day. In general, it is superior to placebo and equivalent to oxybutynin in this regard. As might be expected from its pharmacologic profile, the principal adverse effects of the drug are anticholinergic. In clinical trials, tolterodine was tolerated significantly better than oxybutynin. Its relative merits as a first\u2010 or second\u2010line agent for patients intolerant of oxybutynin are unclear.

The aim of this study was to clarify its mechanism of action in guinea pigs. TAK-637 inhibited the spinal vesico-vesical reflex induced by electrical stimulation of the proximal cut end of the pelvic nerve in spinal animals, but not bladder contractions induced by electrical stimulation of the distal cut end of the nerve. Furthermore, TAK-637 had no effect on carbachol- or electrical field stimulation-induced contractions of isolated bladder muscle strips in an organ bath, whereas drugs used for abnormally frequent micturition inhibited both contractions.

A computer program was developed to determine contraction parameters. Trospium chloride (15 mg orally thrice daily) prolonged the duration of irregular contractile activity after meals (p < 0.02) and reduced its contraction frequency and amplitude (p < 0.001). In the fasting state, the cycle length of the migrating motor complex was prolonged (p < 0.01) by an extended phase I (p < 0.025). Phase III was shortened (p < 0.005) and showed a slower aboral migration velocity (p < 0.005). Clustered contractions were less frequent during postprandial and fasting periods (p < 0.01). Runs of clustered contractions were completely absent with trospium chloride.

This was a double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. One thousand five hundred twenty-nine patients (81% women) with urinary frequency (eight or more micturitions every 24 hours) and urge incontinence (five or more episodes per week) were randomized to oral therapy with tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily (n = 507), tolterodine IR 2 mg twice daily (n = 514), or placebo (n = 508) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was assessed at the end of the treatment period on the basis of the micturition diary variables. Tolerability and safety were assessed by evaluating the adverse events, electrocardiogram parameters, laboratory values, and treatment withdrawals. Tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily (P = 0.0001) and tolterodine IR 2 mg twice daily (P = 0.0005) both significantly reduced the mean number of urge incontinence episodes per week compared with placebo. The median reduction in these episodes as a percentage of the baseline values was 71% for tolterodine ER, 60% for tolterodine IR, and 33% for placebo. The ER formulation was 18% more effective than the IR formulation (P <0.05). Treatment with both formulations of tolterodine was also associated with statistically significant improvements in all other micturition diary variables compared with placebo. For both formulations, the mean decreases in micturition frequency (P <0.0079) and pad usage (P <0.0145) were significant, and the mean volume voided per micturition increased (P = 0.0001). The rate of dry mouth (of any severity) was 23% for tolterodine ER, 30% for tolterodine IR, and 8% for placebo. The overall dry mouth rate for patients taking tolterodine ER was 23% lower than for tolterodine IR (P <0.02), and the rate of severe dry mouth in the ER group was only 1.8%. The rates of withdrawal were comparable for the two active groups and the placebo group. No safety concerns were noted. Tolterodine ER 4 mg once daily is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of overactive bladder with no safety concerns. Tolterodine ER demonstrated an improved efficacy for reducing urge incontinence episodes and a lower frequency of dry mouth compared with the existing IR twice-daily formulation.", "outbound_citations": ["10792154", "10767450", "10775736", "10534791", "10332441", "10210394", "10210604", "10543335", "9720583", "9666761", "9434659", "9426760", "9426756", "9236554", "9353802", "7620236", "8750383", "14173506"], "inbound_citations": ["37160401", "35428431", "34563481", "34593340", "35480442", "34101369", "34010843", "34003613", "33674256", "33153953", "32500759", "32457631", "30720025", "31066800", "30415088", "29977391", "29652494", "29651695", "27792298", "29274718", "29290176", "29274717", "29692690", "29159581", "28776345", "27976476", "27889591", "28067745", "28489120", "27087507", "28431780", "28008590", "27282551", "25932920", "27217862", "26828974", "26883688", "26654220", "28063531", "26149965", "26000514", "25524209", "25369726", "25725183", "25348235", "24666884", "25047051", "24792229", "24971138", "24712917", "24275310", "24601811", "24438613", "24184032", "25797999", "23424164", "23062115", "23826844", "23432937", "23671514", "22861176", "26663241", "23338657", "22999811", "23098785", "23231848", "22873491", "23089342", "23055780", "22934730", "22910177", "22093912", "22711079", "22453185", "22258963", "22344568", "22314120", "16903766", "15524493", "21830836", "24198645", "21639723", "21727941", "21489081", "21468287", "21373193", "21789096", "20886571", "21125358", "24198627", "21075990", "20846201", "20530222", "20395537", "20587837", "20384545", "20415705", "20097022", "20187733"], "label": "1"}

Neurologists with no knowledge of which medication the patient was receiving examined the patients monthly and noted two rating scale scores (Kurtzke and Scripps). Cerebrospinal fluid and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were done at 6 and 12 months. Average neurological scores, demyelinated volumes on MRI, and concentrations of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid were stable or improved in the patients receiving cladrabine but continued to deteriorate in patients on placebo. Mean paired (placebo minus matched cladribine) differences at 12 months relative to baseline were 1.0 (SE 0.4) for the Kurtzke scores, -13.9 (2.3) for the Scripps scores, 4.57 (1.17) mL for demyelinated volumes, and 7.3 (3.3) arbitrary units for concentrations of oligoclonal bands. Cladribine was generally well tolerated and clinically significant toxicity occurred in only 1 patient, in whom severe marrow suppression developed with complete recovery after several months. 1 patient died of newly acquired hepatitis B, an event unlikely to be related to cladribine.

Capsaicin is the main pungent ingredient in \"hot\" peppers of the genus Capsicum. It is a specific neurotoxin that desensitizes C-fiber afferent neurons, which may be responsible for the signals that trigger detrusor overactivity. Studies with capsaicin over the past 8 years have demonstrated clinical efficacy with minimal long-term complications. Most of these studies have also shown that the acute pain and irritation associated with capsaicin are a major deterrent to widespread use.

The treatment of UUI in the elderly population is complicated by comorbidities, polypharmacy, cost, and side effects. The purpose of this study was to examine our practice pattern in Middle Tennessee for the treatment of elderly women with UUI.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all women over age 65 seen at our institution between January 1, 1998 and September 1, 1999 with an initial complaint of pure UUI. Diagnosis was based on history and physical examination by a single urologist (JJF). Initial treatment in all patients was medication as well as timed and double voids. Medication chosen was based on cost factors, co-morbidities, current medications, and outcome from previous treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 53 women ranging in age from 65-87 years of age (avg. 74.7) included in this study, 6/53 (11.3%) had a previous CVA, and 2/53 (3.7%) had grade I-II cystoceles. Initial pharmacologic treatment included anticholinergic medication in 47 patients (88.6%), and either imipramine or topical estrogen alone in the remaining 11.4%. Of the anticholinergics, hyoscyamine time capsules were used in 29, tolterodine in 7, standard oxybutynin in 5, oxybutynin XL in 1, and a combination with imipramine in 5. Thirty-four of the 53 total patients (64.1%) discontinued their medications because of no improvement 14 (41.1%), dry mouth 9 (26.4%), other side effects 9 (26.4%), cost 1, and other reasons in the remaining 2 patients. Only 17 patients (32%) stated they were doing well on their initial medications; 11 of those (64.7%) were taking hyoscyamine time capsules. Upon subjective failure, 22/36 patients (61.1%) had their medications changed, while 14/36 (38.8%) pursued behavioral therapy without additional medications. Urodynamic studies were done in 12 patients who failed empiric medical treatment (22.6%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOnly 32% of elderly women treated medically for UUI were satisfied and continued therapy in this patient population. One-fourth of elderly women failed empiric medical management of UUI due to lack of efficacy, and one-third due to intolerable side effects. In this practice, hyoscyamine was continued more often than any other anticholinergic because of reasonable cost, efficacy, and side effect profile.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29071719"], "label": "1"}

Data from an open label, observational study of 2,250 patients with overactive bladder treated for 12 weeks with tolterodine were analyzed for alterations in frequency, urgency and urge incontinence, and for global efficacy and tolerability using logistic regression analysis, stratifying for gender, age, baseline symptom intensity and tolterodine dose. Gender or tolterodine dose were not consistently associated with altered treatment efficacy. Greater age was associated with a slight but statistically significant decrease in treatment efficacy. Patients with great baseline symptom intensity had greater treatment associated improvement but a lesser chance to become symptom-free. Even with a large number of patients no statistically significant gender or age associated alterations in the tolerability of tolterodine treatment were detected. The extent of the therapeutic response to tolterodine is largely determined by the extent of baseline symptoms. While gender does not affect the efficacy or tolerability of tolterodine in a clinically relevant manner, advanced age is associated with a slight decrease in efficacy but not in tolerability.", "outbound_citations": ["12180221", "11412210", "11464038", "11111207", "10991909", "10534791", "10685872", "10571617", "10494888", "10332441", "9720548", "9435320", "9228196", "8996313", "7620234", "2405938"], "inbound_citations": ["37063295", "35325367", "32902360", "32189383", "32036621", "31945207", "31918590", "30644570", "31090095", "29780784", "28948362", "27988986", "28042309", "27605255", "26988893", "26623416", "24706493", "25690022", "24797765", "24610862", "24582119", "23494586", "24165427", "22816871", "24917740", "22907761", "22871042", "22276958", "22834707", "22369391", "21489081", "21210910", "21168951", "20970833", "20974482", "22453614", "20846192", "20809661", "20500534", "20639026", "20689584"], "label": "1"}

They were asked to imagine a finger opposition movement performed with their right hand, externally paced at a rate of 1 Hz. Trials alternating between motor imagery and rest were measured. A pilot study of three age\u2010matched controls was also performed. We chose the task as a robust method of activating the supplementary motor area (SMA), defects of which have been reported in PD. The PD patients showed normal degrees of activation of the SMA (proper) when both \u201coff\u201d and \u201con.\u201d Significant activation with imagining movement also occurred in the ipsilateral inferior parietal cortex (both \u201coff\u201d and when \u201con\u201d) and ipsilateral premotor cortex (when \u201coff\u201d only). The patients showed significantly greater activation of the rostral anterior cingulate and significantly less activation of the left lingual gyrus and precuneus when performing the task \u201con\u201d compared with their performance when \u201coff.\u201d PD patients when imagining movement and \u201coff\u201d showed less activation of several sites including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when compared to the controls performing the same task. No significant differences from controls were present when the patients imagined when \u201con.\u201d Our results are consistent with other studies showing deficits of pre\u2010SMA function in PD with preserved function of the SMA proper. In addition to the areas of reduced activation (anterior cingulate, DLPFC), there were also sites of activation (ipsilateral premotor and inferior parietal cortex) previously reported as locations of compensatory overactivity for PD patients performing similar tasks.

The proportion of women with a clinical diagnosis of urinary incontinence but with normal findings from urodynamic tests ranged from 3 to 8%. Overall sensitivity of urodynamic tests was about 85-90% in the diagnosis of urodynamic stress incontinence, but generally lower following diagnosis of urge and mixed incontinence. No relationship emerged between urodynamic test results and response to medical treatment. This literature review shows that the sensitivity of clinical history versus urodynamic tests was 0.82, 0.69 and 0.51 respectively for stress, urge and mixed urinary incontinence. It also suggests that urodynamic diagnosis does not predict response to treatment. These data add to the ongoing 'urodynamics or no urodynamics' debate in the evaluation of urinary incontinence and show that urodynamic testing may not be helpful for patients receiving initial non-invasive therapy.

Although pharmacotherapy plays an indispensable role in the management of MS symptoms, optimal disease management requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines medication, rehabilitation, and patient education.

This places responsibility on health care providers to control a patient\u2019s MS-related symptoms to limit disability and delay impairment in the activities of daily living. Owing to the importance of symptom control, comprehensive patient evaluations should be performed at regular intervals to determine the extent of neurological damage and disease progression and to address changing patient needs.

Ditropan XL [(Oxy-XL), a controlled-release formulation of oxybutynin chloride, is a once-daily oral dosage form that incorporates the OROS technology. Dry mouth as the pharmacodynamic measure was compared between Oxy-XL and IR-Oxy administration. The steady state stereospecific pharmacokinetics were also established for the two formulations and the kinetic-dynamic relationship of oxybutynin was examined.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a randomized, repeated-dose, double-blind, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study. After a baseline assessment day, volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences and received 4 days of each treatment with a washout period of 7 days between treatments. The treatments were: 1) Oxy-XL 10 mg in the morning and placebo 8 h later, and 2) IR-Oxy 5 mg in the morning and again 8 h later. Volunteers assessed dry mouth severity subjectively using a 100 mm visual analogue scale, VAS (Baseline, treatment days 1 and 4) and objectively by collecting saliva (Baseline and treatment day 4) before dosing and every hour after the morning dose for approximately 16 h. Several blood samples were collected during each treatment, with frequent sampling on day 4 to analyse for plasma R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin concentrations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRelatively constant plasma concentrations of oxybutynin and its metabolite were seen over 24 h following Oxy-XL administration with the degree of fluctuation being much lower (P = 0.001; 66% to 81% reduction for the various analytes) than IR-Oxy. Compared with IR-Oxy, Oxy-XL yielded higher (131% and 158% for the R- and S-isomer, respectively) oxybutynin and lower (62% and 78% for the R- and S-isomer, respectively) desethyloxybutynin bioavailability, suggesting reduced first-pass metabolism. Saliva output (area under the effect curve) was significantly higher [P = 0.001; 37% (95% confidence interval: 24, 51%)] with Oxy-XL than with IR-Oxy and, accordingly, dry mouth severity (VAS) integrated over the day was significantly lower with Oxy-XL. The decrease in saliva output and the consequent increase in dry mouth severity correlated with the metabolite R-desethyloxybutynin concentration, and no apparent relationship was observed with the R-oxybutynin concentration. This suggests that the metabolite may contribute to the dry mouth. Therefore, the reduction in metabolite exposure with Oxy-XL may be a possible explanation for the observed decrease in dry mouth severity with OXY-XL compared with IR-Oxy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOxy-XL maintains relatively constant plasma drug and metabolite concentrations and minimizes first-pass metabolism of oxybutynin. The metabolite appears to contribute to dry mouth associated with oxybutynin, and following Oxy-XL metabolite exposure is reduced compared with IR-Oxy. Consequently less dry mouth was observed with Oxy-XL as compared with IR-Oxy.", "outbound_citations": ["10332441", "10073329", "9720583", "9200560", "9400033", "9258982", "9072550", "7620236", "7754481", "2181492", "2849672", "3234461", "0", "3450848"], "inbound_citations": ["33368382", "32884926", "29709423", "29159581", "27853957", "27631556", "26634274", "27034721", "26649286", "25444842", "24133005", "24036364", "24036011", "22871042", "22759901", "23094215", "22473491", "21290231"], "label": "1"}

The revolutionary institution of clean intermittent catheterization has changed the algorithm totally. Furthermore many new drugs have been developed during the past decade and have decreased the need for surgery dramatically. In this article, we will focus on the most recent data on new modalities of therapy to help avoid urinary diversion or bladder augmentation. Recent findings In addition to clean intermittent catheterization and oxybutynin treatment, a new generation of anticholinergic medications, such as tolterodine, has been developed. For patients who drop out because of the side-effects of oral administration, new methods of administration are now available, including extended release and intravesical instillation. For those unresponsive, botulinum-A toxin and resiniferatoxin are two relatively new drugs in the field, administered as intravesical injection and instillation, respectively. Intravesical or transdermal electrical stimulation, sacral nerve stimulation and biofeedback therapy are under development, but as currently administered, are not yet completely successful. Summary Although life-saving in many respects, bladder augmentation introduces life-long risks of its own. Our goal in describing \u2018conservative\u2019 management is to prevent this step. Many alternatives to surgery are available now and more effective strategies are under development.", "outbound_citations": ["14716574", "12010241", "11880086", "11880062", "11905876", "11696802", "11696787", "11696741", "11711357", "11547115", "11581479", "11350411", "11374317", "11298060", "11025748", "10953127", "10869607", "10869608", "10799231", "10699623", "10458433", "10332441", "10022727", "9457296", "9200560", "9146656", "9826987", "8911385", "8683778", "8713559", "8022021", "8126833", "1640530", "1496955", "2249125", "2313806", "2297305"], "inbound_citations": ["36504158", "34844901", "31653462", "27775158", "26926542", "25869825", "23701600", "23543139", "22762536", "23060994", "21779920"], "label": "0"}

Several reports indicate that intravesical oxybutynin is effective in many of these patients but there are some who still fail to respond.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA select group of 10 adults with detrusor hyperreflexia unresponsive to standard oral and intravesical oxybutynin regimens were treated at weekly intervals with 5 mg. oxybutynin orally, or 5 mg. oxybutynin in 100 ml. intravesically for 60 minutes of passive diffusion and for 30 minutes with 5 mA. electrical current. Each treatment (plus oral placebo and 2 intravesical controls) was associated with an 8-hour, full urodynamic monitoring session, and periodic blood and bladder content sampling.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no significant objective improvement with oral or intravesical passive diffusion oxybutynin. Conversely there was significant improvement in 5 of 6 objective urodynamic measurements with intravesical electromotive oxybutynin. Plasma profiles were a single peak and decay following oral oxybutynin and 2 distinct peaks with intravesical passive diffusion and electromotive oxybutynin. Area under the curve for intravesical passive diffusion were 709 ng. per 8 hours versus oral 1,485 (p <0.05) versus intravesical electromotive 2,781 (p <0.001). Bladder content samples confirmed oxybutynin absorption. Oral oxybutynin caused anticholinergic side effects in 7 of 10 patients.

Tolterodine (Detrol\u00ae in North America and Detrusitol\u00ae in the rest of the world, Pharmacia), a competitive muscarinic antagonist, is the first agent of this class to be specifically developed for the treatment of OAB. This agent displays in vivo functional selectivity for the bladder over other tissues that contain muscarinic receptors (e.g., salivary glands, eye), which translates into good efficacy and tolerability in patients with OAB (including the elderly). Comparative, randomised, double-blind studies show that tolterodine (administered as immediate-release [IR] tablets 2 mg b.i.d.) is as effective as oxybutynin (5 mg t.i.d.) in improving all of the troublesome symptoms of OAB but with a significantly lower incidence and severity of dry mouth. The advent of a new extended-release (ER) capsule formulation of tolterodine (4 mg) for convenient once-daily treatment builds upon these findings, with significantly improved efficacy for reducing urge incontinence episodes and a lower frequency of dry mouth relative to the existing IR tablet (2 mg b.i.d.).

With the exception of 1 male volunteer, all participants were classified as extensive metabolisers by cytochrome P450 2D6 genotyping. Volunteers received single oral doses of tolterodine L-tartrate ER 8 mg (2 x 4 mg capsules) on an empty stomach or with a standardised high-fat breakfast. Reference therapy comprised tolterodine L-tartrate IR 4 mg (2 x 2 mg tablets), administered in the fasting state. Serum concentrations of tolterodine, its active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-HM) and the active moiety (sum of unbound tolterodine + 5-HM) were measured for up to 72 hours post-dose. Safety endpoints were also determined. No effect of food on the bioavailability of tolterodine ER capsules was apparent and there was no sign of dose-dumping with meals. The geometric mean fed:fasting ratio of area under the serum concentration-time curve to infinity (AUCinfinity) of the active moiety, for all volunteers combined, was 0.95 (90% confidence interval 0.88 to 1.03). Equivalence with respect to AUCinfinity (dose-corrected) was also found for the ER capsule compared with the IR tablet, although uncorrected maximum serum concentrations were around 50% lower despite the fact that the capsule dose was twice as high. Seven volunteers reported adverse events, predominantly headache. No volunteer reported dry mouth. Overall, there were no safety concerns. The new ER formulation of tolterodine shows no pharmacokinetic interaction with food.

Design: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Data sources: Published papers and abstracts. Study selection: Randomised controlled trials with anticholinergic drug treatment in one arm and placebo in another. Data extraction: Primary outcomes of interest were patient perceived cure or improvement in symptoms, differences in number of incontinent episodes and number of voids in 24 hours, and side effects. Secondary outcomes of interest were urodynamic measures of bladder function (volume at first contraction, maximum cystometric capacity, and residual volume) and adverse events. Data synthesis: 32 trials were included, totalling 6800 participants. Most trials were described as double blind but were variable in other aspects of quality. At the end of treatment, cure or improvement (relative risk 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.29 to 1.54), differences in incontinent episodes in 24 hours (estimated mean difference 0.6, 0.4 to 0.8), number of voids in 24 hours (0.6, 0.4 to 0.8), maximum cystometric capacity (54 ml, 43 ml to 66 ml), and volume at first contraction (52 ml, 37 ml to 67 ml), were significantly in favour of anticholinergics (P<0.0001 for all). Anticholinergics were associated with significantly higher residual volumes (4 ml, 1 ml to 7 ml; P=0.02) and an increased rate of dry mouth (relative risk 2.56, 2.24 to 2.92; P<0.0001). Sensitivity analysis, although affected by small numbers of studies, showed little likelihood of an effect of age, sex, diagnosis, or choice of drug. Conclusions: Although statistically significant, the differences between anticholinergic drugs and placebo were small, apart from the increased rate of dry mouth in patients receiving active treatment. For many of the outcomes studied, the observed difference between anticholinergics and placebo may be of questionable clinical significance. None of these studies provided data on long term outcome.

Of the symptoms of detrusor overactivity, urge incontinence is often the most distressing to the patient. Urge incontinence and other subjective parameters (urinary frequency, urgency) improve in tandem with objective (cystometric) measures (maximum detrusor pressure during filling, volume at first desire to void, maximum bladder capacity) in ambulatory, including elderly, patients treated with oxybutynin. However, on the basis of results of limited investigations, the drug appears ineffective in elderly institutionalised individuals. Relative to other anticholinergic drugs, oxybutynin appears at least as effective as propantheline and similar in efficacy to propiverine in small trials, although these results are not definitive. Further investigation of intravesical oxybutynin may lead to this route becoming an option in patients with pre-existing catheters. Adverse effects--dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision--related to the anticholinergic activity of oxybutynin occur frequently and can be sufficiently troublesome to necessitate treatment discontinuation in up to 25% of patients, depending on the dosage. Increases in residual urine volume suggesting urinary retention (undesirable in patients with idiopathic DI), also can develop in some oxybutynin recipients. In summary, oxybutynin is one of the few drugs proven to be beneficial in some patients with overactive detrusor function. Despite the occurrence of unwanted anticholinergic effects in many patients, and apparent lack of efficacy in the elderly institutionalised population, oxybutynin should be considered for the drug of first choice in patients with detrusor overactivity, including the elderly ambulatory population, when pharmacological therapy is indicated.", "outbound_citations": ["8298896", "10071538", "7907192", "8516987", "8318731", "8490370", "8490377", "1455904", "1586797", "1561204", "1678954", "1724398", "1677577", "2005707", "2023781", "2249115", "2249116", "2198921", "2360335", "2190740", "2351687", "2746767", "2566693", "2724432", "2675580", "2667633", "2849672", "3191355", "3379694", "3389295", "3188289", "2442425", "3668160", "2881993", "3524114", "3959249", "3754815", "6496110", "7109119", "912242", "1643598", "2658513", "2697819", "10147442", "2075888", "2749929", "2210980", "2613733", "1785418", "3335729", "3429165", "3292211", "2093692", "1299977", "8443630", "6370504", "3234461", "1993995", "3992747", "8126833"], "inbound_citations": ["36879156", "36815245", "36050440", "35500302", "33925860", "33805491", "33734828", "32500759", "31813036", "31526515", "31117096", "30637359", "29709423", "30088545", "29740900", "27817901", "27787745", "25754454", "27122197", "26770048", "26149965", "27172124", "25335575", "25348235", "24928951", "24882035", "24903352", "23869107", "23669567", "24075004", "23941788", "23711542", "22976530", "24199182", "22871042", "23094215", "22769237", "22876096", "22607010", "26558027", "22197203", "21963104", "21993887", "22652160", "19275276", "22761613", "21265873", "21687579", "21299469", "20943711", "20955901", "20598326", "20628871", "20877608", "26676219"], "label": "0"}

All patients were initially treated with 0.4 mg. tamsulosin orally once a day. A week later the patients were randomly allocated into group 1-25 who continued treatment with tamsulosin only and, group 2-25 who also received 2 mg. tolterodine orally twice daily. Reevaluation with a quality of life questionnaire and urodynamic study was performed after 3 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo patients from group 2 stopped tolterodine while 1 patient from each group stopped tamsulosin because of hypotension. Analysis revealed statistically significant improvement in quality of life scores only in group 2 patients (mean score 525.0 and 628.4 before and after treatment, respectively, 2-sided t test p = 0.0003). A significant difference was noted in both groups after treatment for maximum flow rate and volume at first contraction. Additionally, in group 2, a statistically significant difference was observed for maximum detrusor pressure and maximum unstable contraction pressure after treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCombination treatment with an alpha-blocker (tamsulosin) plus an anticholinergic (tolterodine) improves quality of life in patients with bladder outlet obstruction and concomitant detrusor instability. Interestingly, no acute urinary retention was observed and tolterodine did not affect the quality of urine flow or residual urine volume. The proposed combination appears to be an effective and relatively safe treatment option in patients with bladder outlet obstruction and detrusor instability.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34769943", "33378614", "33401358", "29432226", "28829208", "28394493", "28508455", "28394492", "28567099", "28166296", "28092069", "27958220", "26739177", "26142712", "26211817", "26149965", "25363606", "25348235", "25031529", "24471868", "24188134", "23932438", "23711541", "23537687", "23731722", "26663450", "24054398", "24223400", "22797835", "23221480", "22428659", "22923069", "21966995", "26676533", "22528586", "26676708", "22500249", "26676451", "21995543", "21753885", "21272154", "21604233", "21344494", "21210910", "21454947", "21125358", "20497416", "19939745", "20036783", "20877608", "20329627"], "label": "0"}

While such clinical eBcacy measures (often surrogate endpoints) are of great generally, they are combined in QoL research. The objective of this review is to discuss the impact value and particularly important in clinical trials, they fail to address the patients\u2019 concept of disease burden on QoL of the OAB and analyse the improvements that can be achieved with an eCective and well-tolerated drug and the consequences of treatment from the patients\u2019 perspective. Measuring these patient-derived values is such as tolterodine. We used the SF36 and the EuroQol to assess the impact of the OAB on patients\u2019 well-being, therefore important, as patients are paying a larger part of treatment costs and health outcomes are increasingly and the IQoLI and the KHQ to investigate the eCect of treatment with tolterodine. The IQoLI was tested for use evaluated from the patients\u2019 view. The benefits of specific treatments and of the healthcare delivery system in in a clinical trial setting and the KHQ, so far only validated with female patients, was also validated for general will be judged in terms of the extent to which changes in patients\u2019 functioning or well-being meet their use in men. needs and expectations. Subjective quality of life (QoL) can be objectively Disease impact measured and several instruments have been developed, validated and used extensively. Generic instruments The SF36, a generic instrument, was used both in crosssuch as the MOS Short Form (SF) 36 [13] provide a sectional surveys and in clinical trials. The instrument profile of the patients\u2019 QoL covering several health includes 36 questions with multiple answers that are concepts, generally grouped in physical, mental and grouped into eight subscales measuring eight health social domains. Instruments such as the EuroQol EQ-5D concepts or domains. Each subscale is scored individually [14,15] measure QoL as an index and provide a healthbetween 0 (worst) and 100 (best). It was integrated in state classification system that allows their use in costtwo large \u2018willingness-to-pay\u2019 (WTP) surveys in Sweden utility analyses. The advantage of generic measures is [21] and in the USA [22] of patients with urge and/or that they are more comprehensive and allow comparimixed incontinence. Scores were correlated with selfson across populations and diseases. However, they are reported symptoms of frequency and incontinence, and generally not sensitive enough to detect small changes to the amounts that patients were willing to pay for caused by treatment. Specific measures are targeted symptom relief, to estimate the impact of the syndrome on patients\u2019 QoL.

Interview topics included reasons for prescribing new drugs launched between January 1998 and May 1999; reasons for prescribing the new drug rather than alternatives; and sources of information used for each prescribed drug.\n\n\nRESULTS\nImportant biomedical influences were the failure of current therapy and adverse effect profile. More influential than these, however, was the pharmaceutical representative. Hospital consultants and observation of hospital prescribing was cited next most frequently. Patient request for a drug, and patient convenience and acceptability were also likely to influence new drug uptake. Written information was of limited importance except for local guidelines. GPs were largely reactive and opportunistic recipients of new drug information, rarely reporting an active information search. The decision to initiate a new drug is heavily influenced by 'who says what', in particular the pharmaceutical industry, hospital consultants and patients. The decision to 'adopt' a new drug is clinched by subsequent personal clinical experience.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrescribing of new drugs is not simply related to biomedical evaluation and critical appraisal but, more importantly, to the mode of exposure to pharmacological information and social influences on decision making. Viewed within this broad context, prescribing variation becomes more understandable. Findings have implications for the implementation of evidence-based medicine, which requires a multifaceted approach.", "outbound_citations": ["11823361", "11701576", "11509431", "11259994", "10758087", "10673486", "10647803", "10647801", "10796542", "9329308", "7715044", "8169895", "8374840", "7902513", "8103150", "8343631", "8501666", "8374841", "1739831", "2905075", "13177800"], "inbound_citations": ["36934249", "36944508", "36474170", "36514598", "34353789", "33864629", "33882439", "33571265", "32681402", "32645026", "35372950", "32494994", "32054324", "34007584", "31578187", "30808297", "30728010", "29721844", "29754592", "30607097", "30273368", "29786162", "29485337", "29147963", "28549568", "28818520", "28690701", "28260280", "28247279", "28399515", "28045652", "28079325", "27977744", "27695725", "27556929", "27464570", "27431911", "27086984", "26959895", "26919873", "26858034", "26428701", "26702910", "26651830", "26178420", "26123945", "25965891", "25380607", "25331607", "25304517", "25279555", "25377037", "24911123", "24770928", "23218551", "24148207", "24080260", "23887011", "23826758", "23799906", "23241163", "23714273", "23609765", "23734277", "22957936", "22834964", "23238416", "23509590", "22585420", "23024721", "22952970", "22876867", "23093896", "22833879", "22480873", "22401169", "22375684", "23002397", "23205141", "22182458", "22072320", "21503785", "21897718", "21292626", "21897717", "21510719", "21414143", "22145057", "21833180", "21143939", "21155704", "20672554", "20509953", "20497986", "20497985", "20214796", "20096496"], "label": "0"}

The objectives of this descriptive study were to examine utilization patterns and discontinuation rates of various pharmacologic agents used to treat symptoms of overactive bladder, primarily urge incontinence (UI), and to estimate the prevalence of urinary incontinence in the study population. Patient-level data regarding specific drugs used to treat UI and the use of diapers or pads over a 9-month period from October 1995 to May 1996 were retrospectively extracted from the medication databases of 9 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. A total of 2233 male patients were included in the analyses. Most patients were receiving oxybutynin chloride (39.8%), dicyclomine hydrochloride (16.0%), or imipramine hydrochloride (13.9%), and the remaining 30.3% were using flavoxate hydrochloride, propantheline bromide, hyoscyamine sulfate, and adult diapers or pads. Overall, 72.1% of patients had been prescribed daily dosages within the recommended dosing ranges for these medications. The majority (91.3%) of patients had not switched to another UI medication during the study period. Based on a chronic disease index, 47.6% of patients had 2 or fewer chronic diseases. Using pooled prevalence estimates, the estimated percentage of patients who had ever experienced UI in this population ranged from 7.4% to 20.8%; however, a considerably smaller percentage were taking medications for the treatment of UI. The results of this study suggest that oxybutynin, dicyclomine, and imipramine are the agents most commonly used to treat urinary incontinence within Veterans Affairs medical centers. The majority of patients who received a prescription for one of these drugs did not routinely refill the medication over the course of the study. There are many reasons for patients not to refill a prescription (eg, ineffectiveness, side effects, complications, obtaining the drug from another source), but the present study did not address the causes.", "outbound_citations": ["10408995", "9560071", "9426760", "9426746", "1592266", "2179369", "2179370", "3051459", "3535446", "6485483", "4871634"], "inbound_citations": ["32265405", "32367801", "30169840", "26981589", "25480503", "24091072", "21489081"], "label": "0"}

Pharmacotherapy is still the corner stone in the management of detrusor hyperreflexia. Further studies with tolterodine, oxybutynin, trospiumchloride and propiverine have increased our knowledge about these substances. Capsaicin was proved to be the effective substance and not the alcoholic solution, which serves as a carrier.

Urodynamic studies were performed in 50 patients with complete cauda equina injury from trauma with an infusion ratio of 30 ml/min. Findings of urodynamic studies and clinical features of patients with low compliance were compared with those of the normal compliant patients. Fourteen patients with low compliance received oral administration of oxybutynin and propiverine and intravesical instillation of oxybutynin to increase the compliance and capacity of the bladder, and follow-up urodynamic studies to monitor the change were undertaken. Bladder compliance was decreased in 14 (28%) patients and normal in 36 (72%) patients. There was a significantly long time interval between the onset of injury and the initiation of rehabilitative treatment in the neurogenic bladder group with low compliance when compared to those of the normal compliance group (P < 0.05). Clean intermittent catheterization was used as the voiding method, significantly less than the normal compliance group (P < 0.05). ADC was observed in six out of fourteen patients with low compliance neurogenic bladder, but none in the normal compliance group. Upon the completion of conservative treatment, ADC disappeared in four patients whose compliance and capacity of the bladder were normalized on follow-up urodynamic studies. ADC was only observed in the low compliant bladder and as ADC disappeared when compliance and capacity of the bladder was normalized; low compliance appeared to be the main cause of ADC.

The aim of the present study was to compare the antimuscarinic properties of tolterodine with those of oxybutynin, in vitro and in vivo. Tolterodine effectively inhibited carbachol-induced contractions of isolated strips of urinary bladder from guinea pigs (K(B) 3.0 nM; pA2 8.6; Schild slope 0.97) and humans (K(B) 4.0 nM; pA2 8.4; Schild slope 1.04) in a concentration-dependent, competitive manner. The affinity of tolterodine was similar to that derived for oxybutynin (K(B) 4.4 nM; pA2 8.5; Schild slope 0.89) in the guinea-pig bladder. Tolterodine (21-2103 nmol/kg (0.01-1 mg/kg); intravenous infusion) was significantly more potent in inhibiting acetylcholine-induced urinary bladder contraction than electrically-induced salivation in the anaesthetised cat. In contrast, oxybutynin displayed the opposite tissue selectivity. Radioligand binding data showed that tolterodine bound with high affinity to muscarinic receptors in urinary bladder (K(i) 2.7 nM), heart (K(i) 1.6 nM), cerebral cortex (K(i) 0.75 nM) and parotid gland (K(i) 4.8 nM) from guinea pigs and in urinary bladder from humans (K(i) 3.3 nM). Tolterodine and oxybutynin were equipotent, except in the parotid gland, where oxybutynin bound with 8-times higher affinity (K(i) 0.62 nM). Binding data on human muscarinic m1-m5 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that oxybutynin, in contrast to tolterodine, exhibits selectivity (10-fold) for muscarinic m3 over m2 receptors. The K(B) value determined for oxybutynin (4.4 nM) in functional studies on guinea-pig bladder correlated better with the binding affinity at muscarinic M2/m2 receptors (K(i) 2.8 and 6.7 nM) than at muscarinic M3/m3 receptors (K(i) 0.62 and 0.67 nM). The tissue selectivity demonstrated for tolterodine in vivo cannot be attributed to selectivity for a single muscarinic receptor subtype. However, the combined in vitro and in vivo data on tolterodine and oxybutynin may indicate either that muscarinic M3/m3 receptors in glands are more sensitive to blockade than those in bladder smooth muscle, or that muscarinic M2/m2 receptors contribute to bladder contraction.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35881423", "16784047", "29542337", "28407338", "29282013", "28431780", "27476126", "26904412", "25348235", "24038323", "24978084", "23171069", "22871042", "23094215", "21265873"], "label": "0"}

We reviewed our experience with this population of men and present the results of our analysis. A total of 109 male spinal cord injured patients at the Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center have been treated with chronic indwelling catheters (80 transurethral and 29 suprapubic). Thirty-eight patients (35%) were identified as using oxybutynin on a regular basis. These patients were compared to those not using oxybutynin with regard to urodynamic parameters and upper tract deterioration. Specifically examined were bladder compliance, bladder leak point pressure, vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, urolithiasis, febrile urinary tract infections and serum creatinine greater than 2 mg./dl. The mean duration of indwelling catheter use was 11.9 years (12.4 without oxybutynin and 10.9 on oral oxybutynin). Of the 31 patients with normal compliance (greater than 20 ml./cm. water), 24 (77%) were using oxybutynin (p = 0.001). Bladder leak point pressures were abnormal (greater than 35 cm. water) in 5 of 32 patients (16%) on oxybutynin versus 34 of 60 (57%) without it (p <0.001). Hydronephrosis was present in 15 of 66 patients (23%) without oxybutynin versus 1 of 36 (3%) with oxybutynin (p = 0.009). Febrile urinary tract infections occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%) versus 17 of 62 patients (27%) with or without oxybutynin, respectively (p = 0.077). No significant differences were found between the 2 groups with regard to reflux, renal scars, stones or elevated serum creatinine. It appears that regular use of oxybutynin may be beneficial in spinal cord injured patients who require chronic indwelling catheters for bladder management. Our analysis reveals that patients who take oxybutynin regularly have better bladder compliance, lower bladder leak point pressures and less hydronephrosis.

The subjects' task was to make a speeded saccade to a visual target, which appeared a variable time after onset of the cue either in the cued or an uncued spatial position. There was no overall difference between PD patients and control subjects in terms of the initial facilitation following reflexive cues, and later inhibition of return (IOR). However, PD patients differed from control subjects in two important respects. First, they were significantly faster than were control subjects on this reflexive visual-orienting task. Second, disease severity correlated with attentional performance; more advanced patients showed less initial facilitation but greater IOR. Thus PD patients show better performance on a reflexive saccade task and, for more advanced patients, greater IOR than control subjects.

Formal epidemiological studies of the safety of these medications in typical patient populations are lacking, particularly studies of serious events. We sought to determine whether the use of urinary antispasmodics increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias or sudden death.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRetrospective cohort study.\n\n\nSETTING\nRetrospective analysis of data of participants in community, hospital or nursing home setting.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nFourteen thousand six hundred thirty-eight subjects with a diagnosis of urinary incontinence made between January 1, 1991, and June 30, 1995; all were aged 65 and older and enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid or the Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled programs of New Jersey.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nFilled prescriptions for oxybutynin (Ditropan), flavoxate (Urispas), hyoscyamine (Cystospas), and hyoscyamine sulfate (Cystospas-M) were used to define days of exposure to these drugs. We also identified all use of nonsedating antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, and their concurrent use, to serve as a positive control exposure. Two outcomes were then defined: a new diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmia combined with initiation of an antiarrhythmic medication and sudden death. Other covariates, including clinical, demographic, medication use, and healthcare utilization variables, were also assessed. Adjusted risk ratios of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death were derived from multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no significant association between periods of use of urinary antispasmodics and the development of ventricular arrhythmias (adjusted risk ratio (RR) = 1.23, 95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-1.75) or sudden death (adjusted RR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.28-1.74). A significantly increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia was observed for the positive control regimen, concurrent use of nonsedating antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (adjusted RR = 5.47; 95% CI = 1.34-22.26), but not for use of either drug group alone. Concurrent use of nonsedating antihistamines and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors was also associated with a significant increase in the risk of sudden death (adjusted RR = 21.50, 95% CI = 5.23-88.37). Other variables significantly associated with ventricular arrhythmia included ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure, whereas nursing home use before the index date was associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of and treatment for ventricular arrhythmia. Other variables significantly associated with sudden death included male gender, black race, and congestive heart failure.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAntimuscarinic urinary antispasmodics available before 1996 were not associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Additional study will be required to confirm these results, exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounders contributing to any lack of an observed relationship, and extend these findings to newer agents such as tolterodine.", "outbound_citations": ["1623896", "10744090", "10215756", "10338262", "10098565", "9426760", "8892492", "8805725", "8657260", "8824696", "8750398", "7662454", "7606309", "7695465", "8750383", "7930284", "8109548", "8239250", "1607900", "1574091", "1677700", "1676922", "1678954", "2292235", "2159694", "2620468", "2684071", "2924409", "3627196", "3595445", "2863012", "6720566", "7044245", "123182", "235500", "5047425", "5561439", "5420630", "6061275", "4380481"], "inbound_citations": ["24294974", "23848044", "22711079", "21595741"], "label": "1"}

Given the prevalence pattern of overactive bladder and the widespread use of oral contraception, circumstances are likely to arise in which physicians may wish to prescribe tolterodine for patients already taking oral contraceptives. Based on a search of MEDLINE from 1990 to 2001, there have been no studies of whether concomitant use of these agents entails a risk of drug-drug interaction or conception. This study investigated the effects of tolterodine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a low-dose combination oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 microg/levonorgestrel 150 microg). This was an open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study in healthy women. Oral contraception was given for 21 days either alone or in combination with oral tolterodine 2 mg BID (on days 1-14) over two 28-day contraceptive cycles. Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed on day 14 based on plasma levels of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel up to 24 hours after dosing and serum tolterodine levels at 1 to 3 hours after dosing. The potential for pharmacodynamic interaction was assessed in terms of the risk of failure of suppression of ovulation based on serum levels of estradiol and progesterone measured throughout each cycle. Twenty-four healthy women (age, 23-41 years [mean, 30 years]; height, 155-178 cm [mean, 167 cm]; body weight, 51-75 kg [mean, 64 kg]) participated in the study. There was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between tolterodine and the steroid hormones in the oral contraceptive used, nor did the oral contraceptive show any relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with tolterodine. Serum levels of estradiol and progesterone indicated suppression of ovulation in both treatment periods. In this selected population. coadministration of tolterodine did not affect the contraceptive efficacy of a low-dose combination oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel.", "outbound_citations": ["11341475", "10583027", "10223495", "10190648", "9630826", "9531513", "9353847", "9447563", "8877250", "8347289", "1458892", "6430642", "6820336", "7381862", "838796"], "inbound_citations": ["31335301", "27475034"], "label": "1"}

Fifteen consecutive neurologically impaired patients (8 from multiple sclerosis, 4 from spinal cord injury, 3 from other causes) with complications of previous bladder management underwent ileovesicostomy.

At a mean follow-up of 23.2 months, 14 of 15 patients had low-pressure urine drainage through their ileovesicostomy. Four women with documented preoperative detrusor hyperreflexia had postoperative intermittent mild urge incontinence per native urethra. They did not require any further treatment, except for oral anticholinergic drugs (oxybutynin and tolterodine). Because of persistent severe urge incontinence, 1 woman required conversion of her ileovesicostomy to an ileal conduit with concurrent cystectomy. The ileovesicostomy of another myelodysplastic man who had four failed artificial urinary sphincters in the past was also converted to an ileal conduit because of persistent urethroperineal fistula despite perineal urethral closure. Renal function was preserved in all patients. Long-term complications were stomal stenosis in 2 patients, bladder and kidney stone formation in 5, and symptomatic urinary tract infections in 3. Ileovesicostomy can be safely performed in neurologically impaired women and men. Severe preoperative detrusor hyperreflexia with urge incontinence appears to be a risk factor for persistent urge incontinence postoperatively in women. Continued routine urologic surveillance for infection and stones is mandatory. Ileovesicostomy is a versatile procedure for neurologically impaired patients, because it can be converted to a conventional ileal conduit if necessary.

Refractory DI was defined as the lack of clinical improvement after at least 6 months of conventional drug therapy. These patients underwent additional evaluation with diagnostic urethrocystoscopy. All patients had a normal urinalysis and negative cytologic findings. Diagnostic urethrocystoscopy revealed isolated bladder tuberculosis in one and transitional cell carcinoma in another. Seven other patients had bladder diverticula (only one of which was also diagnosed by sonographic examination) and 22 had mild-to-moderate bladder trabeculations. The absence of other alarming signs (ie, recurrent urinary tract infection, hematuria, significant residual urinary volume, positive cytologic findings, or suspicious sonographic findings) cannot confirm the lack of significant lower urinary tract abnormalities among patients with refractory DI.

Prescribers may intend to treat a selected group of patients with new drugs; this practice could result in significant bias in assessing outcomes of these agents during their use in daily clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate what type of patient received tolterodine compared with the spasmolytic drugs previously marketed (oxybutynin, flavoxate, emepronium). DESIGN: An observational, follow-up study. SETTING: Eighteen collaborating community pharmacies. PATIENTS: Aged \u226518 years, noninstitutionalized; initial therapy with tolterodine, oxybutynin, flavoxate, or emepronium. RESULTS: Tolterodine was often used as a second-line and even as a third-line treatment, and was prescribed to a \u201cpolluted\u201d population in terms of concomitant psychotropic medication. Tolterodine users were 7.5 times more likely to have received another spasmolytic drug (RR 7.5, 95% CI 4.8 to 11.9). In addition, these patients more frequently used antiparkinsonian drugs (RR 4.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 10.4) as well as antipsychotic drugs (RR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.2). There was a small difference in concomitant use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines between patients receiving tolterodine versus those taking other spasmolytic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine is prescribed for a population differing from that receiving previously marketed spasmolytic drugs. Selective prescribing should be recognized when evaluating new drugs in daily clinical practice. Policy makers, such as pharmacy and therapeutics committees, should consider this aspect in their formulary decisions since selective prescribing can lead to unjustified conclusions about a drug's therapeutic effects (e.g., efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness).", "outbound_citations": ["9121357", "9169957", "8848182", "7620236", "8064562", "8103150", "7901502", "1431721", "2057656"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

References of these articles were searched for relevant trials. Strong evidence supports bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, and some medications, but only fair evidence supports fluid adjustment, caffeine reduction, and stopping smoking. Weight loss and exercise are supported by expert opinion only. Consensus opinion is that, whenever possible, conservative management should be considered first.\n\n\nMAIN MESSAGE\nGood evidence shows that initial management by primary care physicians is effective. After basic assessment and tests, strategies such as bladder retraining, pelvic floor exercises, and lifestyle modifications, augmented by appropriate medications, can be successful. If initial strategies are unsuccessful, patients can be referred.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMore than a million Canadians suffer from UI. In almost all cases, family physicians are the first health professionals contacted by patients.

This study was designed to describe clinical presentation of this entity in male neonates, the urodynamic pattern, prognosis in terms of renal function and therapeutic management since birth, in our experience with four cases.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe reviewed the records of 4 male neonates diagnosed at birth of bilateral high-grade VUR (grade > or = 4) with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis; thus 8 refluxing renal units (RRU) were studied. All cases had renal failure at birth. In all cases dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renography was performed. All RRU had reflux nephropathy; 5 RRU had moderate impairment of renal function (20-40%). In 3 RUU was demonstrated by a severe decrease in renal function (10-20% in 2 RUU, and less than 10% in 1 RUU). Micturating cystouretrography (MCUG) excluded the presence of posterior urethral valves; however, in all cases a tightened bladder neck (\"bladder neck impression\") was present. Endoscopy was performed in one baby excluding posterior urethral valves. Follow up ranged from 2 to 5 years (mean 3.5).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn all 4 cases underwent transient urinary diversion during their first month of life. Urodynamic study revealed a high-risk bladder with low compliance, a reduced functional bladder capacity and a high residual urine volume in all cases. All the patients was placed on antibiotic prophylaxis and oral oxybutinin chloride. Three patients underwent bilateral Cohen ureteral reimplantation. The other boy underwent left nephrectomy, right Politano ureteral reimplantation and ureterocystoplasty. In the 7 RRU postoperative MCUG revealed cessation of reflux. Currently therapy includes antibiotic prophylaxis in 4, oral oxybutinin in 4 and intermittent catheterisation in 2 patients. 3 patients have normal renal function. The other boy underwent re-diversion because of renal failure.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFetal severe bilateral reflux nephropathy is a clinical entity almost exclusively in male neonate mimicking hyper-pressure syndrome due to urethral obstruction, in terms of evolution (to chronification and renal failure) and treatment (that requires primordial management of bladder dysfunction). Absence of anatomical urethral obstruction and urodynamic pattern suggest functional obstruction of bladder neck-periurethral sphincter complex in fetal life as a cause for this syndrome. For this reason we consider it as a clinical presentation of fetal non-coordinated voiding in male or \"posterior urethral valves like syndrome\".", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Results of randomised double-blind placebo-controlled studies indicate that tolterodine 4 mg/day (administered as immediate-release tablets 2mg twice daily or extended-release capsules 4mg daily) is superior to placebo in improving micturition diary variables in patients with overactive bladder. Moreover, tolterodine 2mg twice daily is as effective as oxybutynin 5mg 3 times daily. Maximum treatment effects with both drugs occurred after 5 to 8 weeks of treatment and improvements were maintained during long term treatment for up to 24 months. In a pooled analysis of four 12-week studies, equivalent and significant reductions in micturition frequency (-2.3 and -2.0 vs -1.4, p < 0.001) and the incidence of urge incontinence episodes (-1.6 and -1.8 vs -1.1, p < 0.05) were reported for tolterodine 2mg twice daily and oxybutynin 5mg 3 times daily compared with placebo. Functional bladder capacity was also significantly increased. Improvements in patient perceptions of their urgency symptoms and of problems caused by their bladder condition were significantly greater during treatment with tolterodine than with placebo. Tolterodine was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of up to 24 months' duration. Dry mouth was the most frequent adverse event. The incidence (40 vs 78%, p < 0.001) and intensity of this event was lower with tolterodine 2mg twice daily than oxybutynin 5mg 3 times daily. Additionally, a 23% lower incidence of dry mouth was reported with once daily extended-release tolterodine capsules than with twice daily immediate-release tablets (p < 0.02). The incidence of adverse CNS events with tolterodine was low and similar to that of placebo. Tolterodine was well tolerated in elderly patients and no serious tolerability concerns were identified. Tolterodine is the first antimuscarinic agent to specifically developed for the treatment of overactive bladder. The functional selectivity of tolterodine for the bladder translates into good efficacy and tolerability in patients, including the elderly, with overactive bladder. Tolterodine is as effective as oxybutynin in improving micturition diary variables but is associated with a significantly lower incidence and intensity of dry mouth. This favourable tolerability profile, together with sustained clinical efficacy during long term treatment, places tolterodine as valuable treatment for the symptoms of overactive bladder.", "outbound_citations": ["11516807", "11402632", "11454106", "11342895", "11374317", "11269570", "11248608", "11482747", "11327200", "11286323", "11069384", "10767450", "10775736", "10755330", "10571650", "10571617", "10573314", "10583026", "10332441", "10223495", "10210394", "10233562", "10193658", "10206324", "10338262", "10190648", "10081718", "10543335", "9666761", "9671109", "9630826", "9531513", "9509293", "9469685", "9434659", "9883934", "9467475", "9776013", "9426760", "9422015", "9402781", "9353847", "9352692", "9307522", "9236554", "9247842", "8981565", "7620236", "8750383", "8248281", "2005707", "3379694", "3627585", "6337667", "2151318", "10344916", "9121357", "8857788", "9144906", "3292211", "10160084", "9200560", "9806105", "9617596"], "inbound_citations": ["36795936", "36425049", "35520658", "32202433", "30637359", "29709423", "28858835", "26149965", "25348235", "23869107", "23800037", "23891744", "22871042", "23094215", "22910177", "21830836", "21265873", "20530222", "20877608"], "label": "0"}

Among people aged 15 to 64 years, UI occurs in 1.5 to 5% of men and 10 to 25% of women. Severe incontinence occurs in 6% of the general US population, and it is estimated that $US10 billion per year is spent in direct costs alone on care for these patients. This review presents a description of the various types of UI and describes the prevalence and costs of the condition. In addition, 3 approaches to assessing the impact of UI on quality of life are discussed, namely generic measures, disease-specific measures and qualitative approaches. We also review papers on UI and sexual functioning, UI in men, and some aspects of treatment. The review was conducted in the process of developing a new disease-specific measure for urinary urge incontinence (UUI). In general, the literature suggests that UUI has a greater impact than stress incontinence on quality of life, and that UI affects social and psychological functioning more than physical functioning. Only in a minority of individuals is the impact of UI disabling; however, most individuals with UI show significant reduction in their social functioning. Several studies suggest that the impact of UI is not solely a function of its severity, but also depends on individual coping abilities. Some studies also indicate that the social problems associated with UI grow with time, but it is not clear if that is a function of increasing severity of the condition, or the particular adaptations required for coping with this problem. An important distinction appears to be the ability of individuals to avoid public notice of their condition because of uncontrolled accidents. In summary, there is a need for a new measure of the quality-of-life impact of UUI that is based on the literature and on in-depth interviews with patients.", "outbound_citations": ["3201169", "9248807", "8308974", "8120507", "8409154", "8272651", "8258600", "8254588", "8490377", "8502856", "8470564", "1468266", "1467853", "1410952", "1626203", "1307239", "1942274", "2010587", "2393793", "2327465", "2179382", "2313016", "2313009", "2313010", "2179368", "2296416", "3144344", "3051459", "3385112", "3382610", "3347980", "3627585", "6619715", "6212559", "7201456", "6973203", "955750", "5021738", "20254970", "8260222", "10147442", "1360765", "7095984", "6805716"], "inbound_citations": ["26246036", "26419074", "25878413", "22237808", "21479614", "20132203", "20212061", "24198609"], "label": "0"}

Urinary bladders were obtained from 20 patients who underwent total cystectomy due to malignant bladder tumor. The detrusor preparations were taken from the intact part of the dome of the bladder. Acetylcholine caused a concentration-dependent contraction in human detrusor preparations.

Atropine did not suppress the maximum contraction to acetylcholine, while the other drugs significantly suppressed the maximum contractions at the higher concentrations. Each drug caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the KCl (80 mM)- and CaCl2 (5 mM)-induced contractions; the maximum inhibitions of terodiline and propiverine were significantly greater than those of oxybutynin and atropine.

The treatment of OAB is aimed at reducing debilitating symptoms, which have a significant effect on all aspects of an individual\u2019s quality of life, including social, domestic, psychological, occupational, physical and sexual functioning. Anticholinergic agents are currently recommended as first-line therapy for OAB. Their use results in significant clinical improvement in patients, although a lack of selectivity for receptors in the bladder may lead to troublesome side effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, somnolence, dizziness and constipation. Recent research efforts have focused on developing drugs with a reduced propensity for causing these problems. Of the available anticholinergic agents, oxybutynin and tolterodine are the most widely used to treat OAB. Studies directly comparing tolterodine immediate-release (IR) with oxybutynin IR have shown that the two agents have similar efficacy. However, tolterodine IR is significantly better tolerated, particularly with respect to the incidence and severity of dry mouth. An extended-release formulation of tolterodine (4 mg capsules) has recently been developed to allow for once-daily dosing. In addition to greater convenience, tolterodine extended-release has shown enhanced efficacy and tolerability compared with tolterodine IR.", "outbound_citations": ["12028164", "11702910", "11760781", "11377301", "11412210", "11454106", "11394733", "11342895", "11374317", "11322350", "11248608", "11116281", "11482747", "11183903", "11183901", "10767453", "10767450", "10775736", "10759661", "10755330", "11071699", "10802918", "10571617", "10510109", "10379728", "10332441", "10363730", "10233562", "10073329", "10338262", "10221366", "10081953", "10543335", "9666761", "9503214", "9495728", "9434659", "9883934", "9467683", "9200560", "9307522", "9426760", "9426746", "9366320", "9426747", "9236554", "8819028", "8578271", "7636716", "7620236", "7607378", "8750383", "3535446", "5047425"], "inbound_citations": ["34690904", "32750027", "32009968", "30350884", "30237720", "29496263", "29124347", "29163833", "27853957", "24676791", "25836619", "26666524", "24899225", "23079373", "23896942"], "label": "0"}

Several clinical studies demonstrated the drug's efficacy in reducing the symptoms of an overactive bladder (urgency, urge incontinence and high micturition frequency) and in increasing functional bladder volume. With a clinical effectiveness comparable to oxybutynin, the side effect-profile measures up favourably to oxybutynin. Consequently, though some limitations need to be addressed, tolterodine can be regarded as the drug of first choice to treat overactive bladders in a variety of patient groups: the young (and otherwise healthy), the elderly, as well as in patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency.

The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of tolterodine for patients with urge incontinence (UI) who discontinue initial therapy with oxybutynin in a Canadian setting. We compared 2 treatment strategies for the management of adult patients with UI: (1) generic oxybutynin with no further treatment for patients who discontinue and (2) generic oxybutynin with switch to tolterodine (2 mg BID) for patients who discontinue. We developed a 1-year Markov model (4-week cycle length) with transitions between disease states of normal, mild, moderate, and severe. Transition probabilities over 12 weeks were obtained from randomized trial data, and drug discontinuation rates were obtained from Quebec prescription claims data. Outcome measures were time in \"normal\" health state and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using EuroQol-5D utility scores from a survey of Swedish patients with overactive bladder. Costs to the health care payer and patient out-of-pocket costs (in Canadian dollars) were included. For patients who discontinue oxybutynin, the use of tolterodine is associated with approximately 6 months per year in a normal health or mild disease state, compared with approximately 3 months for those who do not receive further drug therapy after discontinuation. Tolterodine use resulted in an annual additional cost per patient of Can $163. The incremental cost per QALY was Can $9,982 and appeared to be robust to alternative model parameter assumptions. Use of tolterodine in patients with UI who discontinue initial therapy with generic oxybutynin lies within currently accepted benchmarks for cost-effectiveness.", "outbound_citations": ["16674332", "10210394", "10543335", "9666761", "9529408", "9426760", "9426746", "9426762", "9352692", "1306034", "3201170"], "inbound_citations": ["25656409", "25017591", "23885660", "23240800", "22093912", "22711079", "21531901", "15524493", "22237808", "21296454", "20132203", "20349177", "24198609"], "label": "0"}

They act by inhibiting binding of acetylcholine to the muscarinic receptors in the detrusor muscle of the bladder. The same types of muscarinic receptors are found in the salivary glands; thus anticholinergic agents may decrease saliva production and cause dry mouth, a commonly cited reason for discontinuation of therapy. The primary objective of this study was to compare saliva output, which is an objective measure of dry mouth, in subjects taking immediate- or extended-release oxybutynin, tolterodine, or placebo. This was a single-site, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, 4-treatment, 4-period crossover study. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment sequences that included extended-release oxybutynin 10 mg, tolterodine 2 mg, immediate-release oxybutynin 5 mg, and placebo. Saliva output was measured objectively before dosing with each treatment and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after dosing. Thirty-six healthy adult volunteers (22 women and 14 men) participated in the study. They ranged in age from 19 to 42 years (mean, 27 years). Thirty-one were white, 3 Asian, and 2 black. There were no significant differences in predose saliva output between the 4 study groups. With placebo, saliva output increased throughout the day. Saliva output was maintained at predose levels throughout the day with extended-release oxybutynin. Two hours after dosing with tolterodine and immediate-release oxybutynin, saliva output decreased nearly 0.5 g in specimens collected over 2 minutes. All 3 active treatments were associated with lower saliva output compared with placebo. Extended-release oxybutynin and tolterodine were similar with respect to area under the saliva concentration-time curve but were associated with significantly greater saliva output than was immediate-release oxybutynin (P < 0.01). There were no serious adverse events (AEs) in this study. AEs were similar between treatments, although the incidence of headache was higher in the active-treatment groups than with placebo. Objective assessment of saliva output in healthy adult volunteers indicated that extended-release oxybutynin and tolterodine had less impact on saliva output than did conventional immediate-release oxybutynin, suggesting that they may yield lower levels of dry mouth.", "outbound_citations": ["11678784", "10775736", "10429321", "10332441", "10073329", "9720583", "9666761", "9599305", "9517768", "9426760", "7620236"], "inbound_citations": ["22711079", "21639723"], "label": "1"}

A volunteer sample of 197 women aged 55 to 92 years with urge urinary incontinence or mixed incontinence with urge as the predominant pattern. Subjects had to have urodynamic evidence of bladder dysfunction, be ambulatory, and not have dementia. Subjects were randomized to 4 sessions (8 weeks) of biofeedback-assisted behavioral treatment, drug treatment (with oxybutynin chloride, possible range of doses, 2.5 mg daily to 5.0 mg 3 times daily), or a placebo control condition. Reduction in the frequency of incontinent episodes as determined by bladder diaries, and patients' perceptions of improvement and their comfort and satisfaction with treatment. For all 3 treatment groups, reduction of incontinence was most pronounced early in treatment and progressed more gradually thereafter. Behavioral treatment, which yielded a mean 80.7% reduction of incontinence episodes, was significantly more effective than drug treatment (mean 68.5% reduction; P=.04) and both were more effective than the placebo control condition (mean 39.4% reduction; P<.001 and P=.009, respectively).

In the other 22 patients (group II), the same size catheter was passed into the bladder, and oxybutynin chloride was administered. The elapsed time to first voiding, pain, and straining was observed in group I and the groups were compared regarding time of catheter removal, accidental removal of catheter/stent, hospital stay, and complications.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll stented patients strained at first voiding. Nineteen showed pain, and only 5 voided in the first 8 hours. The catheterized group had no such problems. Time of catheter/stent removal and hospital stay were similar. Three stents were dislodged in patients with significant straining. Meatal stricture was noticed in 5 and 3 patients and fistula in 5 and 2 patients of group I and II, respectively. Complications were significant in patients whose stents were removed accidentally.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nStenting led to significant patient irritability with voiding problems. The authors believe that this caused displacement and accidental removal of the stent and eventually resulted in meatal stenosis and fistula. The findings show that bladder catheterization prevents these complications.

In a double-blind, randomised, four-way crossover study, 16 healthy volunteers received single oral doses of tolterodine 5 mg and oxybutynin 2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg. Voiding parameters were assessed for 12 hours post-dose, along with visual accommodation (near point of vision) at regular intervals. A dose-dependent increase in maximum bladder capacity was observed for oxybutynin [2.5 mg (+35%), 5 mg (+45%) and 7.5 mg (%)]. The effect of tolterodine 5 mg on bladder capacity was approximately twice (+93%) that seen after oxybutynin 5 mg and the onset of the effect was more rapid with tolterodine. Effects on visual accommodation were also dose-dependent for oxybutynin (maximum changes in near point of vision were 13%, 20% and 29%, respectively). The maximum change observed after tolterodine 5 mg was the same as after oxybutynin 5 mg (i.e. 20%). Tolterodine seems to exhibit selectivity for the bladder over the eye.

Reported prevalence rates of urge and mixed incontinence in the United States range from 3% to 8% and 5% to 37%, respectively, and the highest prevalence has been found in geriatric and psychogeriatric populations. Associated costs are substantial. Total costs of OAB in the United States were estimated to be $12.6 billion in 2000. Patients with OAB score lower than the general population in QOL assessments. All aspects of QOL can be compromised by OAB, as physical, social, occupational, domestic, and sexual activities are often limited in OAB patients. The pharmacist is instrumental in improving an individual's QOL through ensuring safe and effective treatment for OAB. Oxybutynin and tolterodine (Detrol-Pharmacia) have been the mainstays of pharmacotherapy for OAB, but frequent adverse effects (including dry mouth) often prevent patients from adhering to treatment. Tolterodine, now available in a new long-acting formulation, has been proven safe and efficacious in the treatment of OAB, with fewer adverse effects and better tolerability than existing agents.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPharmacists can play an active role in helping identify and recommending interventions for OAB that can ultimately improve an individual's QOL.", "outbound_citations": ["12811491", "11412210", "11342895", "11248608", "11517841", "10894308", "10332441", "10363730", "10543335", "9929859", "9666761", "9560070", "9510336", "9434659", "9883934", "9829424", "9426760", "9426746", "9426762", "9351481", "9236554", "9033516", "8873490", "8790229", "7627295", "7620236", "8308974", "8490377", "1643598", "1942274", "2129289", "2249117", "2333037", "3144344", "3125502", "3627585", "3583011", "3490584", "6694461", "7109138", "7197246", "7427654", "7420551"], "inbound_citations": ["35536677", "34853012", "27063854", "25688038", "23489517"], "label": "0"}

One in two women suffers from a UTI at least once in her life. The young and sexually active are particulaly affected, but it is also seen in elderly, postmenopausal women. The likelihood of recurrence is high. Diagnosis is made with regard to typical complaints and the presence of leucocytes and nitrites in the urine. A culture is unnecessary in most cases. Uncomplicated UTI should be distinguished from complicated UTI, which has a risk of severe illness. The treatment of choice--short-term therapy with trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin--is successful in over 80% of the cases. Co-trimoxazol fluoroquinolones or cephalsporins are not considered first-choice drugs. There are indications that general practitioners' (GPs') management of UTI is not always optimal, specifically concerning diagnostic tests, the application of second-choice antibiotics, and the length of prescribed treatment courses. Many points relevant to GPs requirefurther research, such as epidemiology and resistance of urinary pathogens in the community and natural history of UTI, as well as optimal management in elderly or complicated patients and men.", "outbound_citations": ["15633559", "1625341", "14558545", "12094098", "12135831", "12020306", "11914994", "11871930", "11784218", "12184721", "12137628", "11869659", "11687116", "11832791", "11733475", "11586959", "11512502", "12083027", "11434731", "11434727", "11485707", "11431298", "11268881", "11118930", "11018165", "10979915", "10979067", "10929873", "11042910", "11042915", "10922042", "10905532", "10897517", "10695584", "10750215", "10648665", "10669181", "10796775", "10796207", "10724022", "10796774", "10625136", "10692756", "10589881", "10330864", "10190377", "10440064", "10225575", "10052444", "10037399", "10555247", "9755298", "9786476", "9704305", "9701853", "9640319", "9667091", "9496408", "9612877", "9010371", "9332263", "9267377", "9243034", "8672152", "8858457", "8792507", "8686301", "9222573", "8824972", "8554842", "8536832", "7717597", "7715866", "7855970", "7754761", "7654268", "7784999", "8086990", "7818631", "7928828", "7928829", "8067759", "8093138", "8297196", "7942213", "8146514", "8229904", "8357110", "8350884", "8345609", "8343701", "8509475", "8465719", "8284649", "8297163", "1419246", "1638577", "1681158", "1931203", "2284520", "2197450", "2193352", "2182732", "2178724", "2324774", "2922027", "2694823", "2486388", "3259613", "3257670", "3333659", "3563430", "3484773", "3871318", "6695949", "6396834", "6837358", "7045440", "6282377", "7453771", "6971287", "6993946", "6104083", "6992677", "7376306", "1045245", "942357", "5327811", "5883428", "13596645", "9825092", "10491234", "8298585", "11686987", "11782843", "3871597", "7807037", "10796206", "1345322", "8413414"], "inbound_citations": ["36992968", "34021431", "33499824", "33172396", "32880271", "34222986", "30333269", "28606664", "28665281", "28585332", "28569603", "28340586", "26668667", "25649175", "25772398", "25312104", "25672138", "24738161", "24814591", "25695532", "23627344", "22708802", "22789777", "21985418", "21967276", "21821749", "23442530", "21674026", "21169441", "20807557", "20139213"], "label": "0"}

They were divided into three groups: group I was treated with a single nightly prophylactic dose of an antibiotic; group II received a single nightly dose of oxybutinin, or divided in 2-4 doses; group III received a single nightly prophylactic dose of an antibiotic and oxybutinin as in group II.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were more episodes of UTI in group I (44/50), more hospitalizations and problems of malnutrition, and a longer period of treatment was required. In group II, 14/50 children had episodes of UTI, their nutritional status improved and there were less hospitalizations. In group III, 3/50 children had episodes of UTI; they were the best responders and required a shorter duration of treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nProphylactic therapy requires a longer period of treatment. The use of oxybutinin is an alternative modality in the treatment of these children. Combination therapy with a single nightly dose of an antibiotic and anticholinergic (oxybutinin) appears to be the best therapeutic modality for children with recurrent UTI and no anatomical abnormality.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Oxybutynin has been used for treatment of urge urinary incontinence for more than 20 years. Thirty female New Zealand White rabbits were used for this experiment. Each rabbit was anesthetized, and the carotid artery was cannulated for blood pressure monitoring. The bladder dome was catheterized for both monitoring of bladder pressure and cystometry. After initial cystometry, acetylcholine (ACh) was injected into the vesical artery at 15-minute intervals for 4 hours. Cystometry was performed at the 2-hour mark and at the end of each experiment (4 hours). After the third ACh administration, vaginal or oral oxybutynin was given and the effect on the response to ACh, blood pressure, and cystometry was observed. The high dose of oxybutynin completely inhibited the response to ACh and significantly inhibited the micturition reflex. A 45% inhibition of micturition pressure occurred at the intermediate dose. Little effect on compliance after the low dose and a significant increase in compliance after the mid-dose occurred. Both the low and intermediate doses of oxybutynin reduced the response to ACh to approximately 50% of control. No blood pressure effects of vaginal oxybutynin were noted for any concentration. Oral oxybutynin showed very similar effects to that of the intermediate vaginal dose. Vaginally delivered oxybutynin was effective in decreasing bladder compliance and inhibiting intra-arterial ACh-stimulated bladder contractions with little or no effect on the vascular effect of ACh.", "outbound_citations": ["8865324", "11113769", "10775736", "10755330", "10332441", "10391673", "10363730", "10073329", "10081717", "9720583", "9495736", "8727859", "8908661", "8248281", "1640530", "2005707", "1968106", "1689174", "2798553", "3418826", "2893843", "7109119"], "inbound_citations": ["33925860", "26654220", "24036011", "22976530", "23229421", "21071917", "20850838"], "label": "0"}

As a result of increasing longevity in developed nations, the proportion of UI-susceptible individuals continues to grow, presenting clinical and economic challenges to healthcare providers. OBJECTIVE: To assist the clinician in making informed decisions regarding UI, provide information on the wider ramifications of the disease, and provide a comprehensive overview of the condition. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1966\u2013December 1998) was searched for relevant publications using the following search terms: UI, UI in the elderly, treatment of UI, oxybutynin, flavoxate, vasopressin, quality of life in UI, and economic impact of UI. DATA SYNTHESIS: Key articles relating to the etiology, diagnosis, classification, economic burden, quality of life, and treatment of UI were retrieved, and this information formed the basis of the review. CONCLUSIONS: Although UI can be controlled relatively well with existing therapies, only about 50% of affected patients may actually seek care. There are a variety of therapeutic options available for the treatment of UI, although pharmacologic intervention is presently a relatively minor component of overall care; this suggests that effective drug therapy might play a more significant role in the future. The economic burden associated with the care of the incontinent patient is substantial, and in the US the direct medical cost of the disease was estimated at $25.5 billion in 1995. The disease also has a large impact on the individual UI patient, negatively affecting many parameters normally associated with a tolerable health-related quality of life.", "outbound_citations": ["11130087", "10088876", "9921563", "9806182", "9609620", "9560071", "9510336", "9464720", "10344916", "9393298", "9420489", "9426748", "9426760", "9426746", "9426747", "9338746", "9332259", "9313659", "9351481", "9248807", "8677531", "8571994", "8538240", "8534633", "7594164", "7484483", "7484484", "7775717", "8588267", "8006342", "8308969", "8254589", "8254585", "8315230", "8470564", "1410952", "1747675", "2071809", "2010587", "2005707", "1987410", "2265333", "2249117", "2179381", "2179374", "2179376", "2313010", "2179368", "1977664", "2756254", "3191355", "2461883", "3044876", "3333661", "3310369", "9062320", "3535446", "3723724", "3535621", "2863391", "6541710", "6685979", "6685364", "7154179", "7420551"], "inbound_citations": ["32118759", "21179331"], "label": "0"}

During this time period these agents have superseded griseofulvin as the agent of choice for onychomycosis. Unlike griseofulvin, the new agents have a broad spectrum of action that includes dermatophytes, Candida species and nondermatophyte moulds. Each of the 3 oral antifungal agents, terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole, is effective against dermatophytes with relatively fewer data being available for the treatment of Candida species and nondermatophyte moulds. Itraconazole is effective against Candida onychomycosis. Terbinafine may be more effective against C. parapsilosis compared with C. albicans; furthermore with Candida species a higher dose of terbinafine or a longer duration of therapy may be required compared with the regimen for dermatophytes. The least amount of experience in treating onychomycosis is with fluconazole. Griseofulvin is not effective against Candida species or the nondermatophyte moulds. The main use of griseo-fulvin currently is to treat tinea capitis. Ketoconazole may be used by some to treat tinea versicolor with the dosage regimens being short and requiring the use of only a few doses. The preferred regimens for the 3 oral antimycotic agents are as follows: itraconazole - pulse therapy with the drug being administered for 1 week with 3 weeks off treatment between successive pulses; terbinafine - continuous once daily therapy; and fluconazole - once weekly treatment. The regimen for the treatment of dermatophyte onychomycosis is: itraconazole - 200mg twice daily for I week per month x 3 pulses; terbinafine - 250 mg/day for 12 weeks; or, fluconazole - 150 mg/wk until the abnormal-appearing nail plate has grown out, typically over a period of 9 to 18 months. For the 3 oral antifungal agents the more common adverse reactions pertain to the following systems, gastrointestinal (for example, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, diarrhoea, abdominal pain), cutaneous eruption, and CNS (for example, headache and malaise). Each of the new antifungal agents is more cost-effective than griseofulvin for the treatment of onychomycosis and is associated with high compliance, in part because of the shorter duration of therapy.

This study assessed the effects of urge incontinence on quality of life and measured the value of a reduction in symptoms.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 591 patients with urge or mixed incontinence. 495 (83.8%) surveys were returned with complete quality of life and symptom data. Of the total sample, 411 patients received the willingness-to-pay (WTP) survey, from which 257 (62.53%) returns were judged complete and reliable. Information was collected about the number of micturitions and urinary leakages. Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) was measured using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey. Socioeconomic characteristics were also recorded. Value was assessed with a binary WTP question.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS\nQuality of life among the sample population was significantly lower in 5 of 8 dimensions compared with the general US population, and was significantly related to the severity of the symptoms in 6 of 8 dimensions. The median (mean) willingness to pay was $US27.24 ($US87.74) per month for a 25% reduction in micturitions and leakages, and $US75.92 ($US244.54) per month for a 50% reduction in micturitions and leakages. As expected, the willingness to pay was significantly related to the size of the reduction in micturitions and leakages, and household income.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with incontinence perceive substantial benefits from a reduction in the number of micturitions and leakages.", "outbound_citations": ["7742497", "2633317", "8717601", "3393032", "8818123", "9352692", "10126492", "10176778", "10169305", "2010587", "9003940", "10160084", "10176783", "8827972", "3490584", "1942274"], "inbound_citations": ["27596267", "26176660", "26489177", "25741223", "25807422", "24456314", "24007713", "23608668", "26663241", "22777274", "21672484", "19962738", "24198609"], "label": "1"}

The variation in hydroureteronephrosis, they suggested, depends upon the variable response of each bladder to outlet obstruction. I find this explanation troublesome. Why should bladders vary in response to such a degree to similar outlet obstruction? I find it more plausible that the timing of urachal closure, i.e. the closure of a \u2018pop-off\u2019 mechanism, has more to do with this variable response.

In October 1999, we searched the medical databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register to identify prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in the English literature evaluating drug therapy (except hormonal therapy) of urinary urge incontinence. Trials were categorized by type of drug and outcome variables. Forty-seven trials were identified. Twenty-four, 12, and 11 trials evaluated anticholinergic drugs, drugs with anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic properties, and alternative regimens, respectively. Data regarding treatment effects of anticholinergic drugs are consistent with a high therapeutic efficacy and characteristic side effects. Therapeutic efficacy and side effect patterns of terodiline, an agent with anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic properties, were comparable to those of anticholinergic agents. Terodiline, however, has been withdrawn from the market because of its association with cardiac arrhythmia. Of the investigated alternative drug regimens, the papaverine-like smooth muscle relaxant flavoxate was reported to be ineffective. Studies investigating the dopamine agonist bromocryptine, the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin, or the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist baclofen showed subjective and/or objective improvement of symptoms without reaching statistical significance, whereas the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin, the neurotoxin capsaicin, and the prostaglandin synthase inhibitor flurbiprofen led to statistically significant subjective and/or objective improvement of symptoms. No data for subjective and/or objective improvement of symptoms could be extracted from the studies using the anticholinergic and calcium antagonistic agent propiverine and the calcium antagonist thiphenamil. Published trials support anticholinergic drugs as efficacious therapy for urinary urge incontinence, with predictable side effects. At present, these agents represent the pharmacological treatment of choice for this condition. The potential value of selected alternative drugs is underscored by the available data.", "outbound_citations": ["3201169", "14594427", "10897323", "10763311", "10671782", "10510109", "10210394", "9666761", "9776014", "9467475", "9776013", "9121347", "9144906", "8911372", "8937366", "7662454", "7484484", "7775717", "8058236", "8409177", "1598734", "2039897", "2005707", "1771701", "2082973", "2249117", "2198921", "2795725", "2677410", "2675580", "2653554", "2678426", "3289675", "3681312", "3616287", "3304118", "3531034", "3516296", "2998191", "3895410", "6349743", "6337667", "6347753", "7049301", "6966882", "7006730", "6986948", "394795", "380725"], "inbound_citations": ["37160401", "30007054", "29053886", "22542122", "22258963", "21806560"], "label": "1"}

The trial comprised a total of 358 patients with urge syndrome or urge incontinence. After randomisation in the ratio of 3:1, participants were treated continuously for 52 weeks with either trospium chloride (20 mg twice daily) or oxybutynin (5 mg twice daily). At intervals of 4-8 weeks, patients were physically examined with measurements of blood pressure and pulse rate, were questioned about any adverse events, checked for compliance and underwent relevant laboratory tests. As an additional safety measure, an ECG was made at 26 and 52 weeks. Urodynamic measurements were performed at the beginning, and at 26 and 52 weeks to determine the maximal cystometric bladder capacity. Among others things, the frequencies of micturition, incontinence and number of urgency events were recorded in patient diary protocols in weeks 0, 2, 26 and 52. The evaluation of vital parameters, laboratory results and ECGs did not show any relevant changes attributable to the action of the anticholinergics. Analysis of the micturition diary clearly indicated a reduction of the micturition frequency, incontinence frequency, and a reduction of the number of urgencies in both treatment groups. Mean maximum cystometric bladder capacity increased during treatment with trospium chloride by 92 ml after 26 weeks and 115 ml after 52 weeks (P=0.001). Further comparison with oxybutynin did not reveal any statistically significant differences in urodynamic variables between the drugs. Adverse events occurred in 64.8% of the patients treated with trospium chloride and 76.7% of those treated with oxybutynin. The main symptom encountered in both treatment group was dryness of the mouth. For patients on trospium chloride, the estimated risk of an unexpected adverse event was 0.027 per patient per week for all adverse events and 0.009 for dryness of the mouth, resulting in a considerably lower risk during treatment given with trospium chloride than with oxybutynin (0.045 and 0.021, respectively).

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multinational phase-III study was conducted in urology and gynaecology clinics in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Sweden. The study enrolled 293 patients with urodynamically confirmed bladder overactivity, increased frequency of micturition (> or = micturitions/24 h) and symptoms of urgency and/or urge incontinence (> or = 1 episode/24 h). Patients received either tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) or oxybutynin (5 mg three times daily) or placebo. Doses could be reduced, to prevent withdrawal, to 1 mg or 2.5 mg, respectively. The main outcome measures were the mean change from baseline in frequency of micturition/24 h, the number of incontinent episodes/24 h and volume voided per micturition. After 12 weeks' treatment, the mean frequency of micturition decreased by 21% and 19.5% in those receiving tolterodine (n = 118) and oxybutynin (n = 118), respectively, and by 10.5% in those on placebo (n = 57). Among those with urge incontinence at baseline (75% of patients), the mean number of incontinent episodes decreased by 47%, 71% and 19%, respectively, in those receiving tolterodine, oxybutynin and placebo. The effect of tolterodine and oxybutynin on these two micturition variables was statistically equivalent. There was also a comparable increase in mean volume voided per micturition in the tolterodine (27%) and oxybutynin groups (31%), compared with 7% in the placebo group. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event and was reported with greater frequency and intensity among patients receiving oxybutynin than among those receiving either tolterodine or placebo. In the oxybutynin group, more patients also withdrew because of adverse events and a greater proportion required dose reduction as a result of adverse events. Despite dose reduction, the frequency of adverse events and the intensity of dry mouth remained higher among those receiving oxybutynin (2.5 mg three times daily) than in patients who remained on tolterodine 2 mg twice daily. Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of bladder overactivity. Tolterodine was better tolerated than oxybutynin, particularly with respect to the frequency and intensity of dry mouth, but had comparable clinical efficacy. The superior tolerability of tolterodine therefore allows more patients to remain on effective therapy than the current most commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of the overactive bladder.", "outbound_citations": ["9467475", "9776013", "9426760", "7620236", "8058236", "1773155", "2005707", "2198921", "2179375", "2675580", "3379694", "6337667", "432996"], "inbound_citations": ["37160401", "36317256", "34925621", "34563481", "33674256", "33153953", "33061757", "32857073", "32847359", "31094530", "30542809", "31066800", "30415088", "30379180", "29611572", "29159581", "28678587", "28594034", "26756171", "26340514", "27176185", "27176184", "26828974", "26043867", "26000514", "25348235", "25222388", "25196247", "24978084", "24844598", "24741415", "24184032", "23062115", "23186897", "22999811", "23098785", "22777274", "22711079", "22258963", "16903766", "22761613", "21796469", "21727941", "21687579", "21489081", "21299469", "21556215", "21373193", "21046135", "24198627", "20569078", "20303119"], "label": "1"}

After a 1-week run-in period to establish baseline values, 319 patients were randomized to receive placebo or tolterodine 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mg twice daily. Micturition diary and urodynamic variables and subjective urinary symptoms were assessed after 2 weeks of treatment. Patients were classified as \"extensive\" or \"poor\" metabolizers of tolterodine on the basis of serum levels of tolterodine. A per-protocol analysis of efficacy in 262 patients showed dose-related improvements in micturition diary and urodynamic variables. A dosage of 4 mg twice daily was, however, associated with an increase in residual urinary volume. The incidence of adverse events (mainly mild or moderate antimuscarinic effects) was comparable between placebo and tolterodine dosages of 2 mg twice daily. No serious drug-related adverse events were observed, and tolterodine had no clinically significant impact on electrocardiographic or laboratory findings. Changes in urodynamic variables were found to be related to the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and its major active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. In poor and extensive metabolizers of tolterodine, exposure to the sum of these active moieties was similar, and the efficacy and safety profiles were comparable. The results of this pooled data analysis indicate that tolterodine offers an effective treatment for patients with urinary symptoms attributable to overactive bladder.

The complication of urethrocutaneous fistula in hypospadias surgery as a result of using this technique is also evaluated.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA retrospective review (July 1999 to September 2002) identified 180 pediatric patients who had undergone primary hypospadias surgery by a single surgeon. A modified technique of harvesting a vascularized dartos pedicle was incorporated in 111 hypospadias repairs. A ventral based vascularized dartos pedicle of tissue was used to cover a modified urethroplasty as described by Snodgrass.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe intraoperative meatal position before urethroplasty was subcoronal in 95 cases, penile/midshaft in 11 and penoscrotal in 5. The majority of patients (90 of 111) were younger than 12 months at surgery. Ages ranged from 5 months to 16 years (mean 21.1 months). Of the 111 patients reconstruction using the ventral based vascularized dartos pedicle to cover the urethroplasty was successful in 109 (98.2%), and at followup they have an acceptable cosmetic result with no evidence of urethrocutaneous fistula. In 1 patient with distal hypospadias a urethrocutaneous fistula developed, which was recognized 20 months postoperatively. Another patient with penoscrotal hypospadias had a proximal fistula at 6 months. There were no recognized intraoperative urethral injuries or complications. Followup ranged from 3 to 38 months (mean 19.1).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe ventral based vascularized dartos pedicle urethral coverage procedure is an easy and reliable technique to harvest adequate vascularized tissue to cover a hypospadias urethroplasty. In this small single surgeon series, this technique appears to have contributed to a low rate of urethrocutaneous fistulas after hypospadias repair.", "outbound_citations": ["12352344", "11182354", "10751884", "10414718", "10086048", "9598557", "9218028", "9241502", "9297773", "8683797", "8283561", "2354321", "3054168", "3795371"], "inbound_citations": ["36474978", "32430969", "29234534", "29118537", "26424985", "26816767", "23860496", "22868318", "23449992", "24917716", "21159560", "21170855", "19837000", "19857999"], "label": "0"}

Ninety\u2013eight patients (21 male, 77 female; 67.7\u00b16.3 years of age) suffering from urgency, urge incontinence or mixed urge\u2013stress incontinence were included in the double\u2013blind, multicentre, placebo\u2013controlled, randomized study. After a 2\u2013week placebo run\u2013in period, the patients received propiverine (15 mg t.i.d.) or placebo (t.i.d.) for 4 weeks. Before (V1, V2) and during the treatment period (V3, V4), standard ECGs and 24\u2013hour long\u2013term ECGs were recorded. Propiverine caused a significant reduction of the micturition frequency (V2: 8.7\u00b14.2, V4: 6.5\u00b13.2 ml; p\u22640.01), reflected in a significant increase in the average micturition volume (V2: 163.5\u00b165.9, V4: 216.3\u00b1101.5 ml; p\u22640.01) and a significant decrease in episodes of incontinence (\u201354%; p = 0.048).

N-desethyloxybutynin (DEO), by a novel matrix transdermal system (TDS). Two in vivo, randomized, three-way crossover trials examined single/multiple OXY TDS doses. Abdomen, buttock, and hip application sites were compared and dose proportionality was evaluated. Model independent pharmacokinetics, elimination rate constants, and metabolite/drug ratios were derived from both plasma OXY and DEO concentrations. Single/multiple applications of the OXY TDS to the abdomen yielded mean Cmax OXY concentrations of 3.4 +/- 1.1/6.6 +/- 2.4 ng/mL and median tmax of 36/10 h, with steady state achieved during the second application. Plasma OXY and DEO concentrations decreased gradually after Cmax until system removal. Buttock and hip applications resulted in bioequivalent OXY absorption. AUC ratios of DEO/OXY were 1.5 +/- 0.4 (single dose) and 1.3 +/- 0.3 (multiple dose). Mean in vitro OXY skin absorption (186 microg/h) was comparable to the estimated in vivo delivery (163 microg/h) over 96 h. Sustained delivery over 4 days and multiple sites allow a convenient, well-tolerated, twice-weekly OXY TDS dosing. A low incidence of anticholinergic side effects is expected during clinical use because of the avoidance of presystemic metabolism and low DEO plasma concentrations. The consistent delivery, absorption, and pharmacokinetics should result in an effective treatment of patients with overactive bladder.", "outbound_citations": ["11496941", "3234461", "12131314", "11435842", "11322350", "11501617", "10775736", "10073329", "9720583", "9072550", "8626843", "7620236", "8162656", "1640530", "2023781", "2810112"], "inbound_citations": ["36815245", "34101369", "32884926", "32643443", "31326435", "29928984", "28106275", "26654220", "26321038", "25690088", "24036364", "23867086", "24058672", "24199182", "22927031", "22871042", "19275276", "21290231", "21721591", "24198618"], "label": "0"}

The literature on the clinical efficacy and safety of the currently available agents is described. According to the guidelines issued by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), anticholinergic agents should be the first-line pharmacologic therapy for patients with detrusor instability. Oxybutynin is the anticholinergic of choice for this indication, whereas propantheline is the second-line therapy. Although calcium antagonists have been investigated, the one such drug introduced for the treatment of overactive bladder (terodiline) was withdrawn from the market because of a risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Studies of potassium channel openers have found either a lack of clinical efficacy or an unacceptable level of side effects. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists may be useful for decreasing bladder overactivity in patients who have autonomous bladders as the result of conditions such as spinal cord injury. Tricyclic antidepressants (particularly imipramine) may be effective in decreasing bladder contractility, although the AHCPR guidelines caution that these drugs should be reserved for use in carefully evaluated patients. Future developments in the treatment of detrusor overactivity are likely to occur in 3 categories: drugs that affect peripheral excitatory mechanisms, drugs that inhibit afferent mechanisms, and drugs that affect more central actions at either the ganglionic, spinal cord, or supraspinal level. Although pharmacologic management of the overactive bladder has progressed little in the past 10 years, the future may hold the promise of more effective therapies.", "outbound_citations": ["10037430", "8976239", "8976227", "8976244", "7967761", "8248281", "1349978", "1942288", "1677700", "1873687", "2005707", "2795725", "2677410", "2918608", "2798553", "3959249", "3899664", "4023042", "6399953", "7315191", "7009892", "7323743", "7006730", "533592", "421699", "859206", "5058039"], "inbound_citations": ["35226282", "29398096", "28705713", "26224523", "25812116", "25597936", "23360656", "25624808", "22231544", "22506182"], "label": "0"}

Serum tryptase levels greatly increased after anaphylactic shocks (2242%) and anaphylaxis (710.5%). Patients with allergic urticaria and those with idiosyncratic responses to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) exhibited a small increase in serum tryptase (49.5% and 38.2%, respectively). In the other two groups (NAAR and PLA), no variation in this serum protease was observed. The time of appearance of the serum tryptase peak differed considerably among patients with similar clinical reactions (from 30 min to 6 h) and was independent of the latent period, severity of symptoms, or the amount of tryptase released.

Nineteen premenopausal women with SCIs were randomly assigned to receive either sildenafil (50 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, crossover design study. Physiologic and subjective measures of sexual response, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded during baseline and sexual stimulation conditions. Adverse events were also recorded. Significant increases in subjective arousal (SA) were observed with both drug (P <0.01) and sexual stimulation conditions (P <0.001), and a borderline significant (P <0.07) effect of drug administration on vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) was noted. Maximal responses occurred when sildenafil was combined with visual and manual sexual stimulation. Cardiovascular data showed modest increases in heart rate (+/-5 bpm) and mild decreases in blood pressure (+/-4 mm Hg) across all stimulation conditions, consistent with the peripheral vasodilatory mechanism of the drug. Sildenafil was well tolerated with no evidence of significant adverse events. Findings suggest that sildenafil may partially reverse the sexual dysfunction commonly associated with SCI in women. Consistent with previous findings in men, the sexual effects of the drug were most evident under conditions of optimal stimulation. Mild, clinically insignificant cardiovascular effects were also noted.

Seven of the eight patients patients were spina bifida and confined to a wheelchair. One patient had had a previous transverse myelitis. A Benchekroun hydraulic value (in three cases) and a Malone procedure (in two cases) were performed at the same stage. The technique of Kropp-onlay urethral lengthening, which creates a flap value mechanism which leaks when the bladder is too full, is described and illustrated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeven of eight patients were dry during the day and four were occasionally damp during the second part of the night. One could not be dry for more than 2 h during the day but had a very hyperactive detrusor. She developed two bladder stones which required an open vesicotomy. One developed a urethral fistula requiring a second Kropp-onlay procedure and became dry afterwards. Two patients, who did not undergo a bladder augmentation, needed oxybutinin therapy to obtain a satisfactory result. Post-operative urodynamic measurements are discussed.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Knopp-onlay urethral lengthening is easier to perform than the original Kropp procedure.

M2 receptors are the predominant cholinoceptors present in urinary bladder, but mainly the minor population of M3 receptors mediate its contraction. M2 receptors modulate detrusor contraction by several mechanisms, and may contribute more to contraction of the bladder in pathological states such as bladder denervation or spinal cord injury. Prejunctional inhibitory M2 or M4 receptors and prejunctional facilitatory muscarinic Ml receptors in the bladder have all been reported. In clinical studies, tolterodine, a non-selective muscarinic antagonist, has been reported to be as effective as oxybutynin but inducing less dry mouth. Thus, although it is not certain which antimuscarinic drugs have the better efficacy and tolerability, the non-selective antimuscarinic drugs seem to be better than M3-selective antagonists in their clinical efficacies. However, controlled release, or intravesical, intravaginal, or rectal administrations of oxybutynin have been reported to cause fewer side effects. Darifenacin, a new M3 selective antagonist, has been reported to have selectivity for the bladder over the salivary gland in vivo. To verify which antimuscarinic drugs selective for the muscarinic subtypes have the best efficacy and tolerability, comparative clinical trials between M3 selective antagonists and non-selective compounds, such as olterodine, are required in the future.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37187710", "35870560", "35833034", "35793990", "34903279", "34245368", "33456366", "33840935", "33401353", "33092527", "32676385", "30852837", "30637359", "30603826", "30572837", "29862577", "27075022", "28413276", "27589789", "26828974", "26663726", "26084660", "26126437", "25335575", "25015611", "24122009", "23869107", "23512419", "23409689", "26663242", "22652160", "22052440", "20969642", "19899147", "20877608"], "label": "0"}

Within the concentration ranges tested (trospium chloride 10\u221211\u201310\u22126 mol/l, flavoxate and oxybutynin 10\u22129-10\u22125 mol/l, tolterodine 10\u221210\u2013 10\u221210 mol/l), each drug caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the tension elicited by muscarinic stimulation and dose-dependently attenuated the contractions induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS). The effects of trospium chloride and tolterodine on carbachol-induced muscarinic tension were more pronounced than those of oxybutynin, while trospium chloride and oxybutynin were most effective in inhibiting the contractions induced by EFS. Flavoxate was significantly less effective than all other drugs tested. Regardless the individual drug concentrations needed for maximal efficacy, the potency of oxybutynin and flavoxate to reverse muscarinic tension and attenuate EFS-evoked contractions was almost comparable while tolterodine and trospium chloride were more effective in relaxing the muscarinic tension of the detrusor strip preparations than causing inhibition of EFS-induced contractions.

We compared the performance of 3 methods of measuring detrusor contraction strength to identify the best one.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe retrospectively analyzed urodynamics data on 84 females 53 years old or older. All had urge incontinence and were enrolled in a placebo controlled oxybutynin trial. Stop tests (voluntary interruption, mechanical interruption and continuous mechanical occlusion of flow) were performed on each subject.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt baseline the voluntary stop test measured lower mean isovolumetric detrusor pressure +/- SD than the mechanical and continuous methods (31.2 +/- 16.0 versus 47.2 +/- 26.5 and 48.7 +/- 24.4 cm. water, respectively). The latter 2 values also correlated highly (r = 0.87). Followup data on 76 women confirmed these results. Based on baseline and followup values in the 20 women who received placebo the continuous occlusion test showed highest test-retest reliability (r = 0.9, p <0.01), followed by the mechanical (r = 0.69, p = 0.01) and voluntary (r = 0.67, p <0.01) stop tests. Treatment with oxybutynin decreased isovolumetric detrusor pressure in all 3 stop tests by up to 6 cm. water. However, the decrease was statistically significant only for the continuous occlusion test.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo assess detrusor contraction strength in elderly females with urge incontinence the mechanical stop and continuous occlusion tests are acceptable but the continuous occlusion test has better reliability and better detects slight drug induced changes.

On the other hand, data regarding their influence on the central nervous system (CNS) are limited. This randomized, single\u2010blind, parallel\u2010group quantitative\u2010topographical EEG (qEEG) study of clinical phase I investigates the potential CNS adverse effects of the three antimuscarinic drugs\u2014tolterodine, oxybutynin, and trospium chloride\u2014in comparison to placebo. Overall, 4 \u00d7 16 (total 64) young, healthy male volunteers were included in the study. The subjects were given either placebo or the clinically recommended daily doses of the drugs dispensed in three doses on a single day (tolterodine 2 mg bid and once placebo, total 4 mg/d; oxybutynin 5 mg tid, total 15 mg/d; and trospium chloride 15 mg tid, total 45 mg/d). The qEEG was recorded prior to and up to 4 hours after each intake of the trial medication (a total of 10 qEEG sessions) under three different conditions: at rest with eyes open, eyes closed, and under mental demand. The drug tolerability was subjectively evaluated by the volunteer and the investigator. In comparison to placebo (10% confidence interval), tolterodine and trospium chloride did not induce changes of the qEEG power in five of the six frequency bands (i.e., delta, alpha1, alpha2, beta1, and beta2). Isolated power decreases were only observed in the theta frequency band. In contrast, oxybutynin caused significant power reductions in four frequency bands (theta, alpha1, alpha2, and beta1; p < 0.01). The subjectively evaluated drug tolerability was comparable between all treatment groups, although differences in the AE occurrence existed, with the AE frequency being higher in the oxybutynin group. The results of this study support the findings that oxybutynin as a tertiary amine crosses the blood\u2010brain barrier, causing significant qEEG activity changes and more pronounced central adverse effects. Although tolterodine is also a tertiary amine, it shows limited effects on qEEG activity (i.e., slight theta power reductions), comparable to the effects of trospium chloride, a quarternary amine, which barely crosses the blood\u2010brain barrier. The minimal qEEG changes observed with tolterodine and trospium chloride reflect most probably a rebound message from the peripheral target organs. Prescription of oxybutynin thus implicates a higher risk of CNS side effects.", "outbound_citations": ["10767450", "10767453", "10366869", "10072666", "10210596", "10349408", "9434659", "9426748", "9426746", "9426747", "9236554", "9187321", "9426749", "7620236", "7760991", "8750383", "1336819", "2068431", "1658507", "3719350", "3754815", "700598"], "inbound_citations": ["36548636", "36317256", "36066046", "35383492", "35281514", "34429535", "34003613", "33650242", "33647377", "33169433", "32500759", "32337497", "32164868", "31724222", "30973998", "31373245", "30738698", "30766510", "30656943", "31736564", "30217174", "29709423", "28712052", "28360957", "27530266", "26828974", "26789539", "26290863", "26029267", "25466967", "26003253", "25309420", "25225003", "24038213", "24928796", "24566208", "24363860", "24222315", "23453648", "23281786", "23848044", "22976530", "25877263", "23089342", "22883779", "22390261", "22857829", "21907623", "22777274", "22715861", "22811687", "22876096", "22070184", "22314120", "15482001", "22044595", "21855905", "21918729", "21830836", "21392072", "21639723", "21718264", "21607875", "20943711", "21212936", "24198627", "20801529", "20561092", "20948824"], "label": "0"}

Currently, there is no medication available that specifically targets the lower urinary tract without having untoward effects elsewhere in the body. Patients with urge incontinence are the most difficult group to treat. The agents most commonly used to treat urge incontinence, i.e. anticholinergics, musculotropics and tricyclic antidepressants, are limited in their effectiveness and have anticholinergic adverse effects. Other medications with theoretical treatment potential such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium antagonists require more in depth clinical study before widespread use is appropriate. Although estrogen is well tolerated, its role in the treatment of incontinence in postmenopausal women may be limited. Medical treatment for stress incontinence is most successful in patients with a mild condition. Drugs with alpha-adrenergic activity alone or in combination with estrogen in postmenopausal women, are fairly effective and demonstrate few adverse effects at doses used to treat stress incontinence. Enuresis pharmacotherapy consists mainly of desmopressin and tricyclic antidepressants. Adverse effects are minimal with the doses commonly used. While the majority of patients improve with therapy, a significant portion relapse after treatment is terminated. Tolerability of a particular therapy depends on the effectiveness and adverse effects of the agent, the severity of incontinence and the general health of the patient. In general, patients are willing to accept a greater degree of inconvenience if a drug produces the desired effect. However, individualisation of therapy should be used to maximise compliance and outcome. Blinded, dose-titration studies are needed to better determine doses for optimum tolerability. Research into drugs specifically targeting the lower urinary tract may lead to more effective and well tolerated therapy for incontinence and enuresis.", "outbound_citations": ["9072550", "8996345", "9353802", "8911372", "8937366", "8813873", "8534633", "7788255", "7620236", "8750383", "7970999", "7807562", "8058236", "8272292", "8138522", "8107615", "8039334", "2005707", "1771701", "2292235", "2249115", "2259490", "2198921", "2681838", "2795725", "2667633", "2647951", "2461883", "3288951", "3310369", "3307643", "3113475", "3535446", "2423715", "3519020", "3535621", "3908884", "6337667", "6114325", "6986948", "358381", "831350", "4871634", "321205", "1379909", "3201169", "9121357", "1942363", "9144906", "6659222", "6685364", "3292211", "9055151", "1606397"], "inbound_citations": ["20955901"], "label": "1"}

The clinical symptoms of overactive, or unstable, urinary bladder include urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. Mixed urinary incontinence, which comprises urge urinary incontinence and stress incontinence, is manifested by increased intraabdominal pressure on coughing or sneezing. The detrusor muscle of the bladder is under the control of the parasympathetic, or muscarinic, nervous system. The drug of choice in this condition is oxybutynin chloride, which has the ability to block acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves in the urinary bladder, preventing contractions of the muscle and exerting a direct spasmolytic effect on the bladder. A new extended-release oral tablet formulation, OROS oxybutynin, uses osmotic pressure to deliver the drug at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours. It resembles a conventional tablet but has a two-part core consisting of a drug layer and below it, a \"push\" layer containing osmotically active components, the whole surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with a laser-drilled opening in the drug side. Water in the gastrointestinal tract enters the tablet and mixes with the drug to form a suspension. The \"push\" layer expands and pushes the suspended drug out of the orifice and into the gastrointestinal tract for eventual absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies have indicated a slow rise in mean plasma concentration of the isomer R-oxybutynin for 4 to 6 hours after a single dose of OROS oxybutynin, followed by maintenance of steady concentrations for up to 24 hours, minimizing the fluctuations between peak and trough associated with TID dosing of 5-mg immediate-release oxybutynin tablets. Efficacy and safety studies comparing the extended-release with the immediate-release formulation of oxybutynin demonstrated equivalent efficacy in patients with overactive urinary bladder. The adverse-event profile of oxybutynin is similar to that of a typical anticholinergic agent such as atropine--dry mouth, constipation, somnolence, blurred vision, headache, and gastrointestinal pain--although in 2 clinical studies, the incidence of dry mouth was less with the extended-release formulation. Once-daily dosing with OROS oxybutynin appears to be well tolerated and effective, as well as convenient, for the treatment of overactive bladder, particularly for elderly patients using multiple medications.", "outbound_citations": ["9046685", "7752101", "7620236", "8248281", "8490377", "1455904", "1724398", "1993995", "2351687", "2849672", "3524114", "3754815", "7109119"], "inbound_citations": ["33368382", "32884926", "31117096", "26536519"], "label": "0"}

The number and types of treatments were evaluated with respect to baseline factors such as prior diagnosis of IC and symptom severity. One hundred five (18%) women were receiving no therapy at baseline. Single-mode therapy was reported by 195 (34%) women, and a combination of two treatments was reported by 119 (21%) women. Three or more treatments were reported in 162 (28%) women. A total of 183 different types of therapies were recorded. The five most commonly used therapies for IC symptoms were cystoscopy and hydrodistention, amitriptyline, phenazopyridine, special diet, and intravesical heparin. Because most patients entered the ICDB before the approval of oral pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS), only 6% of women reported oral PPS use at baseline. There were statistically significant associations between the number and types of treatments and clinical center, a prior diagnosis of IC, and symptom severity. The diversity of IC therapies underscores the lack of understanding about the treatment of this syndrome.

The medical approach is essentially pharmacological but the management of the nociceptive factors must not be neglected. In the mild urinary dysfunctions, bladder training can be advised. The pharmacological treatment aims at reducing the parasympathetic activity or at deafferenting the bladder. The antimuscarinic agents are an essential part of the treatment. Oxybutynin is the most widely used medication but recent agents like tolterodin have a better tolerability. Other drugs can also be used such as desmopressin, flavoxate. New molecules are under experiment (darifenacin). In case of troublesome side-effects or resistance to oral medications, local treatments are considered. Intravesical oxybutynin has been tried but has a short-lived efficacy. Intravesical instillation of capsaicine or resiniferatoxin blocks C-fibres afferents and leads to clinical and urodynamic improvement. Recently, injections of botulinum-A toxin in the detrusor have been advocated aiming at blocking the transmission of parasympathetic impulse. The first studies report encouraging results. All these local treatments resulting in bladder paresis are recommended for patients performing self-catheterization. Should these treatments fail, other therapeutic approaches are considered such as intrathecal treatment, neuromodulation, before deciding on neurosurgical or urosurgical procedures.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["25415813"], "label": "1"}

Excluding medications in which packaging, formulation, and potential adverse pharmacologic outcomes prohibited splitting, we performed a cost analysis of medications amenable to splitting.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEleven medications amenable to pill splitting were identified based on potential cost savings and clinical appropriateness: clonazepam, doxazosin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, citalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, lisinopril, nefazadone, olanzapine, and sildenafil. For these medications, pill splitting is currently infrequent, accounting for annual savings of $6200 (or $0.03 per member per month), just 2% of the potential $259,500 (or $1.14 per member per month) that more comprehensive pill-splitting practices could save annually.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPill splitting can be a cost-saving practice when implemented judiciously using drug- and patient-specific criteria aimed at clinical safety, although this strategy is used infrequently.", "outbound_citations": ["11276544", "10737832", "10613374", "9469693", "8601268", "8017428", "3414713"], "inbound_citations": ["35193886", "34127559", "29512263", "28579725", "28028813", "27727195", "27346725", "27000324", "25562775", "27200998", "24493092", "23347555", "22522969", "22823455", "22698549", "22573146", "22115548", "21497707", "20921252", "20740332", "20621873", "20069474"], "label": "0"}

Historically the most effective treatment has been muscular relaxing agents and anticholinergic agents. We present a prospective, double blind, cross, placebo control study to evaluate efficacy and tolerance of oxybutynin in women with unstable bladder. We included 44 adult women with unstable bladder, 22 unitially received oxybutynin 5 mg t.i.d. and 22 placebo 5 mg t.i.d. aleatory in both groups through 6 weeks, later wash-out period was performed and those women in which initially received oxybutynin were administered placebo and those women in which initially received placebo, were administered oxybutynin, for another six weeks. Five patients which initiated the study with oxybutynin abandoned the study, 2 of them for intolerance and 3 for unknown causes. Two women in which initially received placebo abandoned follow-up too. A total of 74 subjects (37 for each branch of study) had an age average of 51.7. Symptoms scoring decreased from 13 to 11 and 6 points with placebo and oxybutynin respectively (p = 0.001). The analog visual scale of symptoms decreased from 77% to 62.5% and 40% with placebo and oxybutynin respectively (p = 0.003).

Additional goals were to address whether adverse outcomes were likely to be clinically severe and to incorporate clinical information on diagnoses when available. These criteria are meant to serve epidemiological studies, drug utilization review systems, health care providers, and educational efforts. Consensus from a panel of 6 nationally recognized experts on the appropriate use of medication in the elderly was sought. The expert panel agreed on the validity of 28 criteria describing the potentially inappropriate use of medication by general populations of the elderly as well as 35 criteria defining potentially inappropriate medication use in older persons known to have any of 15 common medical conditions. Updated, expanded, and more generally applicable criteria are now available to help identify inappropriate use of medications in elderly populations. These criteria define medications that should generally be avoided in the ambulatory elderly, doses or frequencies of administrations that should generally not be exceeded, and medications that should be avoided in older persons known to have any of several common conditions.", "outbound_citations": ["7598142", "7944840", "8028142", "8078956", "8005121", "8241607", "8340556", "8477147", "1476504",

DATA SOURCES: Published articles and abstracts were identified from a MEDLINE search (January 1980\u2013October 1998) using the terms tolterodine, PNU-200583E, urge incontinence, overactive bladder, detrusor instability, detrusor overactivity, and antimuscarinic. Pertinent articles written in English were considered for review. Additional articles were identified from the bibliographies of retrieved articles. Data from the Food and Drug Administration\u2013 approved product labeling and the manufacturer were also used in the absence of published data. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Clinical studies of tolterodine involving human subjects were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist with relative functional selectivity for bladder muscarinic receptors. It is metabolized in the liver by CYP2D6 to an active metabolite (DD 01), which is partially responsible for its pharmacologic activity. Those who are genetically devoid of CYP2D6 will have higher concentrations of the parent compound and virtually undetectable concentrations of DD 01; however, the clinical efficacy does not appear to be altered. In dosages of 2 mg twice daily, tolterodine has shown consistent reductions in the number of micturitions per 24 hours and less consistently decreased incontinence episodes in patients with detrusor overactivity. The functional selectivity of tolterodine for bladder muscarinic receptors results in fewer systemic adverse effects, such as dry mouth, than occur with comparable nonselective antimuscarinic agents. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical studies have shown that the effectiveness of tolterodine for symptoms of overactive bladder is similar to that of oxybutynin. The adverse effect profiles of tolterodine and oxybutynin are similar; however, comparative clinical trials have shown significantly fewer patients taking tolterodine require dosage reductions or discontinue therapy due to antimuscarinic adverse effects such as dry mouth. Although more costly than oxybutynin, tolterodine represents a modest improvement over oxybutynin with respect to adverse effect profile, which may allow more patients with incontinence to tolerate therapeutic doses. Further research is necessary to determine whether tolterodine has clinical advantages over similar agents in patients with other muscarinic adverse effects, such as constipation or cognitive impairment.", "outbound_citations": ["10711115", "10543335", "9671109", "9630826", "9584328", "9495736", "9469685", "9434659", "9467475", "9776013", "9121357", "9426760", "9426746", "9426756", "9402781", "9353847", "9351481", "9247842", "8538240", "8521680", "7775717", "7752101", "7624898", "7856993", "8750383", "8016895", "3290911", "3627585", "3592846"], "inbound_citations": ["26043867", "24978084", "24411952", "24191315", "22344568", "20569078", "20097022"], "label": "0"}

Patients with urinary frequency (eight or more micturitions per 24 hours) and urge incontinence (five or more episodes per week) were randomized to oral treatment with tolterodine extended release 4 mg once daily (n=398) or placebo (n=374) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by use of patient perception evaluations. The results presented are a secondary analysis of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Of patients treated with tolterodine extended release, 44% reported improved urgency symptoms (compared with 32% for placebo), and 62% reported improved bladder symptoms (placebo, 48%) (both P<.001 compared with placebo). The odds of reducing urgency and improving bladder symptoms were 1.68 and 1.78 times greater, respectively, for patients in the tolterodine extended release group than for patients receiving placebo. In response to urgency, there was a more than six-fold increase in the proportion of patients able to finish a task before voiding in the tolterodine extended release group. The proportion of patients unable to hold urine upon experiencing urgency was also decreased by 58% with tolterodine, compared with 32% with placebo (P<.001). The proportion of patients reporting \"much benefit\" from treatment was greater for tolterodine extended release than for placebo (43% versus 24%; P<.001).

However, treatment\u2010limiting adverse effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision have restricted the usefulness of previously available agents, such as oxybutynin. A real need therefore existed for effective and well\u2010tolerated agents for the long\u2010term management of the troublesome symptoms of overactive bladder. This review outlines the various approaches that have been used in attempts to overcome the tolerability problems of oxybutynin. It also describes how advances in our understanding of muscarinic receptors and bladder function has led to the potential development of either tissue\u2010 or subtype\u2010selective antimuscarinic agents with improved tolerability. Drugs that have been developed in this way include tolterodine and darifenacin, each of which shows some bladder selectivity in animal models. Unlike darifenacin, however, the bladder selectivity of tolterodine has been confirmed by numerous clinical studies. Tolterodine's improved tolerability compared with oxybutynin, along with its equivalent therapeutic efficacy at recommended dosages, permits patients to experience the beneficial effects of long\u2010term treatment. Tolterodine therefore represents a real alternative for the long\u2010term management of overactive bladder. The results of ongoing clinical studies with darifenacin are awaited before it can be concluded that selective antagonism of M3 receptors leads to improved tolerability over existing agents in the treatment of overactive bladder. Similarly, the potential improvements in tolerability associated with different dosage formulations of oxybutynin, and the clinical utility of S\u2010oxybutynin, are yet to be conclusively demonstrated.", "outbound_citations": ["11374317", "10510109", "10332441", "10223495", "10233562", "10193658", "10073329", "10069505", "10069504", "10069502", "10543335", "9825119", "9720583", "9692772", "9666761", "9647869", "9671109", "9638316", "9883934", "9467475", "9776013", "9200560", "9121357", "9426760", "9426752", "9353395", "9353847", "9313659", "9307522", "9247842", "9113359", "9072550", "9353802", "9426749", "9029489", "8963976", "8822036", "9272038", "8566107", "7616431", "7752101", "7788255", "7620236", "10188786", "8575504", "8750383", "7853228", "8016895", "8010180", "10071538", "8248281", "1640530", "1455904", "1607601", "1861294", "2005707", "1993995", "2023781", "2249115", "2198921", "2351687", "2724432", "2675580", "2667633", "2849672", "3668160", "2881993", "3524114", "3959249", "3754815", "6370504", "568842", "190623", "235500", "5047425", "4962468", "4380481", "14173506"], "inbound_citations": ["36734627", "35236048", "36578645", "34260097", "34053119", "32844599", "32647277", "32197469", "32086713", "31619590", "31718957", "31810880", "31211471", "31599184", "30817137", "29398096", "29709423", "29803689", "29124347", "28727385", "29184855", "28661264", "28262756", "26756554", "28431780", "27681701", "27619779", "27527382", "26654220", "26824901", "26534943", "27111622", "26433883", "25861957", "24676791", "25994331", "25836619", "25636812", "25353990", "26666524", "25335962", "24899225", "24703195", "24350662", "24555904", "24798478", "24373019", "24351128", "24098552", "23545478", "23079373", "23497983", "23994932", "23896942", "22409769", "22909146", "23094220", "23094215", "22824522", "22711079", "22876096", "22491716", "22036776", "12515563", "22310924", "21826717", "21717501", "22046182", "21852588", "22039737", "21462240", "21265873", "21639723", "21272154", "21642736", "24198634", "21258763", "21293089", "22453613", "20801529", "20483954", "20633735"], "label": "0"}

Moreover we obtained a recovery of all daily voiding disturbances after 3 months. Fifty percent of children were cured after 4 months of therapy and finally 93.2% recovered at 6 months. On the other hand, 2 children were no-responders to the therapy even after 9 months of combined drugs administration.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on these results we can affirm that children with nocturnal enuresis and voiding disturbance can be treated with this combined therapy.

Information also became available on hormone replacement therapy, especially its risks, its benefits, alternative treatments for it, and why women choose to take it or not take it. Finally, the effectiveness and cost of testing for breast and endometrial cancer received attention. Coronary Artery Disease Women develop heart disease about 10 years later than men do, but in women this disease is, as it is for men, the number-one cause of death. Smoking is clearly a major risk factor for heart disease in both sexes, and most physicians already devote substantial attention to smoking cessation counseling. In 1997, studies focused on three other risk factors for heart disease in women: diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Women with Diabetes Had Lower High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study 27: plasma lipids and lipoproteins at diagnosis of NIDDM by age and sex. Diabetes Care. 1997; 20:1683-7. Diabetes is a well-known risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. However, women with diabetes who have a myocardial infarction are more likely to die than are diabetic men who have the same event [1]. It has been suggested that this higher mortality rate may be partially due to differences between the sexes in lipid profiles. In this cross-sectional study, the lipid profiles of 2139 men and 1574 women with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were compared across age groups and between the sexes; patients ranged in age from 25 to 65 years and were otherwise in good health. These patients were also compared with a group of British persons who did not have diabetes and with participants in the U.S. Lipid Research Clinics Population Prevalence Study. Only 5% of the women were taking estrogen replacement or oral contraceptives. The women were more obese than the men and had higher fasting insulin levels, higher hemoglobin A1c levels, worse glucose control, and greater systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Lipid profiles are shown in Table 1. Women with diabetes had the highest levels of both total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Moreover, compared with the levels of age- and sex-matched persons without diabetes, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were 23% lower in diabetic women but only 9% lower in diabetic men. Table 1. Plasma Lipid Profiles of Women and Men with Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Compared with Those of Nondiabetic Controls* When age was factored in, it was found that lipid levels in women progressively worsen until age 50 years and then plateau until at least age 65 years. Multivariate analyses found no associations between lipid levels and obesity, high blood pressure, glucose levels, or body mass index. The authors suggest that the lower HDL cholesterol levels seen in these diabetic women may explain as much as 30% of their increased risk for coronary artery disease. Several important treatment studies in diabetic women are not yet complete, but subgroup analysis of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [2] suggests that aggressive management is beneficial. Counseling to improve metabolic control through weight loss and aerobic exercise may also alleviate lipid abnormalities. Hypertension Treatment Prevented More Myocardial Infarctions Than Strokes Gueyffier F, Boutitie F, Boissel JP, et al. Effect of antihypertensive drug treatment on cardiovascular outcomes in women and men. A meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized, controlled trials. The INDANA Investigators. Ann Intern Med. 1997; 126:761-7. Coronary artery disease is the most common, most deadly sequela of hypertension, yet patients often think of stroke prevention as the reason to treat hypertension. This study compared differences between the sexes in the effects of antihypertensive treatment on cardiovascular outcomes. Included in this reanalysis of individual patient-level data were 7473 older (>59 years of age) and 13 362 younger (30 or 35 years of age to 59 years of age) women as well as 5010 older and 14 933 younger men who had been entered into seven trials that primarily used thiazide diuretics and -blockers to treat hypertension. The outcomes measured included mortality, all strokes, all coronary artery events, and all cardiovascular events. Overall, the rate of cardiovascular events was higher in the older groups than in the younger groups (as expected) and was greater for men than for women. Graphical representation suggested that differences between the sexes were related to differences in untreated risk (Figure 1). The results for women and men were most similar in studies that focused on treatment of systolic hypertension with thiazides and -blockers in the elderly. Although the treatment effect is greater for stroke than for myocardial infarction, stroke is much less common than myocardial infarction. Prevention of myocardial infarction is a major benefit of the effective treatment of hypertension in women as well as in men. Figure 1. Sex-specific major cardiovascular events in clinical hypertension trials. Type, Not Amount, of Fat Intake Predicted Coronary Heart Disease Hu FB, Stampfer MJ, Manson JE, et al. Dietary fat intake and the risk of coronary heart disease in women. N Engl J Med. 1997; 337:1491-9. Assessing the implications of fat intake can be confusing to both patients and clinicians. Overall, most experts recommend eating less fat, especially less saturated fat. Butter and meat, which have the greatest concentrations of saturated fats, are the most deleterious common fats; these are followed by hard margarine, which is predominately transunsaturated fat. Peanut butter is a mixture of monounsaturated and saturated fats; olive and canola oils are primarily monounsaturated fats. The most protective fats are corn and sunflower oils, which are largely polyunsaturated fat. Despite these recommendations, we have not known the risks of intake of specific fats with respect to the health of women's coronary arteries. The Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study that began in 1980, sought to end that uncertainty. More than 80 000 nurses completed an initial, detailed food questionnaire and were resurveyed in 1984, 1986, and 1990. They also completed general medical histories every 2 years. Intake of specific fats was divided into quintiles according to the degree of saturation of fats. The cohort was followed for 14 years; the clinical outcomes assessed included non-fatal myocardial infarction and death from coronary artery disease. The results sustained some intuitive beliefs. First, intakes of specific fats were interrelated. For example, persons who ate more olive oil ate less margarine. Second, the greater the intake of nonfat foods, the less the intake of fat overall. However, after 14 years of follow-up and after adjustment for confounding variables in the multivariate analysis, total fat intake did not correlate with clinical outcomes but specific fat intake did. The worst outcomes were found in association with higher intake of transunsaturated fats (hard margarine); a 2% increase in intake almost doubled the clinical risk. A 5% increase in saturated fats produced a 15% increase in adverse outcomes. Vegetable fat fared better; a 5% increase in monounsaturated fat intake was associated with a 10% decrease in adverse events, and a 5% increase in intake of polyunsaturated fats produced a 38% decrease in adverse events. In this cohort, after careful multivariate analysis, total fat intake did not seem to predict coronary artery events. However, vegetable oils, especially olive and corn oils, seem to reduce risk for these events, whereas hard margarine, meat, and butter are especially harmful. Because this study is not a prospective, interventional clinical trial, we do not yet know whether changing the type of dietary fat ingested will change the risk for adverse outcomes. The Women's Health Initiative should answer that question when its clinical trial, now in progress, is completed. Hormone Replacement Therapy plus Pravastatin Effectively Improved Lipid Levels Davidson MH, Testolin LM, Maki KC, et al. A comparison of estrogen replacement, pravastatin, and combined treatment for the management of hypercholesterolemia in postmenopausal women. Arch Intern Med. 1997; 157:1186-92. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia, especially as secondary prevention, is effective in reducing the risk for coronary artery events in both women and men. However, only about 47% of women with known coronary artery disease receive treatment for their hypercholesterolemia [3, 4]. In contrast, much attention has been paid to hormone replacement therapy for the prevention of coronary artery disease. Some observational studies, but few interventional trials, have compared the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, primarily with statin drugs, with hormone replacement therapy [5]. This clinical trial compared the effects of estrogen and pravastatin on the lipid profiles of postmenopausal women. Investigators randomly assigned 76 postmenopausal women with hypercholesterolemia to receive one of four treatment regimens: conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg/d), pravastatin (20 mg/d), both conjugated estrogen and pravastatin, or placebo. Changes in serum lipid profiles and compliance were assessed at 16 weeks. The results are summarized in Table 2. After 16 weeks, the group receiving combined therapy had had the greatest positive effects on LDL cholesterol levels. Regimens that included estrogen, 0.625 mg/d, had a positive effect on HDL cholesterol levels. Levels of triglycerides were increased by estrogen and decreased by pravastatin. Table 2. Comparison of Pravastatin with Estrogen Replacement in Postmenopausal Women with Hypercholesterolemia* From this relatively brief study, which used estrogen without progesterone, several conclusions can be drawn.

We present data on renal and bladder function initially and at followup of boys with PUV in whom the bladder dysfunction has been treated since infancy.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe study included 35 boys with PUV. Bladder regimen, including early toilet training from the age of 1.5 years and detrusor relaxant drugs for the treatment of incontinence from ages 4 to 6 years, was introduced to all patients. A total of 19 boys were started on clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) at a median age of 8 months due to pronounced bladder dysfunction with poor emptying, unsafe pressure levels, high grade reflux and renal impairment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo serious complications of CIC have been seen during followup. Of the 19 boys 2 stopped performing CIC due to noncompliance of the parents at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Initial renal function, measured as median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in percent of expected for age, was 60% in the CIC group and 90% in the nonCIC group. At followup at a median age of 8 years the CIC group (n = 14, 3 transplanted boys excluded) had an increase in median differential GFR (difference between followup and initial GFR) of 7% (p <0.01), which was similar increase to that of the nonCIC group. In the 2 boys who stopped performing CIC renal function deteriorated with a median differential GFR of -24%. In the CIC group detrusor instability decreased. Poor compliance was seen in 6 of the 19 boys initially and only one remained poorly compliant. In 1 of the boys who stopped performing catheterization a low compliant bladder developed. In all of the other cases bladder capacity increased more than expected for age.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results suggest that treatment of bladder dysfunction in boys with PUV can counteract the deterioration in renal function seen during childhood but the number of patients in our study is limited.", "outbound_citations": ["11743343", "11547099", "10737529", "10330919", "9634026", "9258133", "8558707", "7815621", "7850332", "1640516", "1585504", "2336745", "2336746", "3408870", "3201164"], "inbound_citations": ["36683802", "34686914", "34053205", "33343111", "32328778", "30709926", "29264889", "28367330", "28233231", "27311411", "23847007", "24679888", "25083164", "23147930", "21163706", "21369376"], "label": "0"}

Patients were given sodium valproate 1000-1500 mg/d or placebo for 12 weeks and then crossed over for an additional 12 weeks after a 4week washout period. A reduction in mean number of days with migraine headache per 4-week time period was noted during sodium valproate therapy (3.5 d with migraine) compared with baseline (6.1 d with migraine; Wilcoxon p = 0.0003) and placebo (6.1 d with migraine; Wilcoxon p =0.0018). Seventeen of the 34 patients (50%) were classified a~ responders. Responders were patients who demonstrated a reduction of days with migraine to at least 50% of baseline during treatment with sodium valproate. Six of 34 (18%) responded during placebo treatment. Twelve percent of patients deteriorated during sodium valproate treatment compared with 41 % receiving placebo. Responders during sodium valproate treatment increased to 65% (ANOYA P = 0.023) during the last 4-week treatment period compared with 21 % (ANOYA P = 0.94) during placebo. The authors concluded that sodium valproate was an effective and well-tolerated prophylactic medication for common migraine. The severity and duration of attack were not affected by sodium valproate (intensity score 2.3 based on a 0-3 scale of effect on daily activities; duration 11.1 h) compared with placebo (intensity score 2.2; Wilcoxon p =0.9; duration 11.5 h; Wilcoxon p = 0.45). Adverse effects were reported by 33% of patients during sodium valproate treatment and by 16% during placebo. The most common adverse effects noted were nausea, dyspepsia, drowsiness, increased appetite, and weight gain. 7 Additional common adverse effects generally seen with valproic acid are tremor and transient hair loss. Hepatic failure has occurred with valproic acid, although hepatotoxicity is rare in patients older than 10 years. Liver function tests are recommended before initiating valproic acid therapy and should be monitored frequently, especially during the flTSt 6 months oftherapy.3 The use ofvalproic acid is limited in women of child-bearing age due to increased incidence of neural-tube defects in infants of mothers taking valproate.4 To our knowledge, the most recent study9 comparing the safety and efficacy of divalproex sodium and placebo for migraine prophylaxis was conducted by researchers from eight headache/neurology clinics in the US. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial had a 4-week, single-blind placebo baseline phase and a 12-week treatment phase (4-week dosage adjustment, 8-week maintenance period). Prior to starting the baseline phase, those patients taking other migraine prophylactic medications completed a washout period based on the half-life of the drugs. The patients were randomized to receive divalproex (n = 70) or placebo (n = 37). Dosages were adjusted during the first 4 weeks of the treatment phase to achieve actual/sham trough divalproex concentrations of 70-120 mg/L (mean average daily dose of divalproex 1087 mg). The mean migraine headache frequency per 4 weeks during the treatment phase was 3.5 for divalproex and 5.7 for placebo (p :0; 0.00 I) compared with baseline phase results of 6.0 with divalproex and 6.4 with placebo. Also, a reduction in migraine frequency of 50% or more was noted in 48% of divalproex patients versus 14% of placebo patients (p < 0.001). Those patients receiving divalproex also noted less functional restriction and used less symptomatic medication per episode compared with patients receiving placebo. No significant differences between the groups were observed in the outcome measures of average peak severity or duration of individual headaches. The most common adverse effects seen with the divalproex therapy were nausea, drowsiness, vomiting, and asthenia. Tremor and hair loss were also associated with divalproex treatment. Of the 70 patients who received divalproex, 9 (13%) were withdrawn from the study because of adverse effects, while 2 (5%) of 37 placebo-treated patients were withdrawn (NS). The authors concluded that divalproex was an effective, well-tolerated drug for migraine prophylaxis with a safety profile of that typically seen in patients with epilepsy who receive divalproex therapy. This trial had a larger patient sample compared with the previously mentioned studies and offers still more evidence of the safety and efficacy of valproates as an alternative in migraine prophylaxis.", "outbound_citations": ["7654268", "7849342", "8413414", "8389010", "1576648", "3146862", "3280278", "237749", "1093308", "4639942", "4990290"], "inbound_citations": ["36657655", "35821069", "35174061", "30624087", "29302624", "24575779", "21852596"], "label": "0"}

This study used a standard auditory oddball paradigm to compare the latency, amplitude, and topographic distribution of P300s in neuroleptic-free schizophrenic patients with those of healthy controls. The patients then were treated for 6 weeks with either remoxipride or haloperidol, and their P300s were reassessed. P300s were attenuated and delayed among neuroleptic-free patients. There was no evidence of peak lateralization or amplitude asymmetry over temporal areas. Subsequent neuroleptic medication normalized P300 latencies and increased P300 amplitudes, but the latter remained below normal limits over all except frontal areas.

Children with voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux historically have a high breakthrough infection rate of 34% to 43%. Breakthrough infection represents significant morbidity and it is the most common indication for surgical intervention for vesicoureteral reflux. Voiding dysfunction is present in 79% of patients who proceed to reflux surgery. We evaluated the impact of pelvic floor muscle retraining combined with a medical program in patients with voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux. Children with a history consistent with voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux were screened by uroflowmetry/electromyography, bladder scan for post-void residual urine, renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography. Confirmed cases of voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux were prospectively enrolled in this study. Children participated in an interactive, computer assisted, pelvic floor muscle retraining program that involved a conservative medical regimen and pelvic floor muscle retraining. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics. We evaluated the rate of breakthrough urinary tract infection, reflux outcome and surgical intervention. A literature review with the key words vesicoureteral reflux, voiding dysfunction and urinary tract infection was performed to identify historical control cases for comparison. Study enrollment criteria were fulfilled by 49 girls and 4 boys 4 to 13 years old (average age 8.8), representing 72 units with low grades I to II (48) and high grades III to V (24) reflux. Mean followup was 24 months. Initial uroflowmetry/electromyography and bladder scan revealed a staccato flow pattern and normal post-void residual urine in 11% of cases, staccato flow pattern and elevated post-void residual urine in 10%, flattened flow pattern and normal post-void residual urine in 28%, and flattened flow pattern and elevated post-void residual urine in 51%. Breakthrough infection developed in 5 patients (10%), including 1 in whom reflux had resolved and 1 with grade I reflux who underwent observation. The parents of 2 patients elected to complete biofeedback without surgical intervention and these patients did not have a repeat infection. Reimplantation was performed in 1 case (2%). There was resolution in 18 low and 7 high grade refluxing units, including 2 older patients with a long history of high grade bilateral disease. Average time to resolution was 7.8 months. We noted elevated post-void residual urine in 88% of the patients with high grade reflux. Average age at resolution was 9.2 years. During a 24-month period one of us (P. H. M.) noted a greater than 90% decrease in surgical intervention. A combined conservative medical and computer game assisted pelvic floor muscle retraining program appears to have decreased the incidence of breakthrough urinary tract infections and facilitated reflux resolution in children with voiding dysfunction and vesicoureteral reflux. Patients with high grade reflux and voiding dysfunction commonly present with elevated post-void residual urine, contraindicating the indiscriminate administration of anticholinergics. Decreasing the rate of urinary tract infections may have a dramatic impact on the need for surgical intervention and enable the reflux resolution rate to approximate that in patients without voiding dysfunction. Prospective controlled trials are needed to determine whether pelvic floor muscle retraining combined with a conservative medical regimen alters the natural history of vesicoureteral reflux in patients with voiding dysfunction.", "outbound_citations": ["10840114", "10571635", "10588270", "10565756", "10458467", "10458466", "10458431", "9783967", "9719268", "9634033", "9523672", "9258181", "9258180", "9112544", "8326607", "1433593", "1433592", "1433591", "4057409", "4057410", "6606053", "480497", "978818"], "inbound_citations": ["33017072", "31928898", "30316318", "26370584", "24126731", "23791993", "23489504", "24416638", "21614468", "21527216", "20974487", "21213078", "20569800", "20569802", "20425100"], "label": "0"}

In order to elucidate whether anticholinergic drug is also effective for these symptoms related to bladder hypersensitivity (sensory urgency), clinical efficacy of oxybutynin on sensory urgency was compared with that on motor urgency. Method: Twenty-four patients with sensory urgency, and 53 patients with motor urgency were treated with oxybutynin (6 mg/day) for 4 weeks and subjective and objective efficacies were evaluated. Subjective parameters were quantified with urge score (grade 0\u20133) and daily numbers of voiding and incontinence. Objective efficacies were evaluated with pre-/ postcomparison of cystometric parameters. Results: Excellent or good overall efficacy was obtained in 62.5% (15/24) of the sensory urgency group and 60.4% (32/53) of the motor urgency group.

Of these, 3219 were home dwellers.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES\nPrevalence of potentially inappropriate drugs and prevalence of drugs considered inappropriate related to 15 common medical conditions according to recommendations given by the expert panel in 1997.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe response rate was 78%. Of the respondents, 12.5%, 1.3%, and 0.2% were taking at least 1, 2, or 3 inappropriate drugs, respectively. The most prevalent inappropriate drugs were dipyridamole (3.6%), long-acting benzodiazepines (2.6%), amitriptyline hydrochloride (1.6%), ergot mesyloids (1.6%), muscle relaxants (1.2%), and meprobamate (1.1%). Use of medications considered inappropriate with certain medical conditions was higher: 27.2% of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were taking beta-blockers and 19.3% used sedatives. Of diabetic individuals taking oral hypoglycemics or insulin, 32.5% were taking a concomitant beta-blocker. Of those with a peripheral vascular disease, 37.9% were taking beta-blockers.

The taste-masked granules were prepared using aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymers (Eudragit E-100) by the extrusion method. None of the drugs dissolved from the granules (% of dissolved, < 5%) even at 480 min at pH 6.8 in the dissolution test. However, the drugs dissolved rapidly in the medium at pH 1.2 in the dissolution test. Rapidly disintegrating tablets were prepared using the prepared taste-masked granules, and a mixture of excipients consisting of crystalline cellulose (Avicel PH-102) and low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose (L-HPC, LH-11). The granules and excipients were mixed well (mixing ratio by weight, crystalline cellulose: L-HPC = 8:2) with 1% magnesium stearate, and subsequently compressed at 500-1500 kgf in a single-punch tableting machine. The prepared tablets (compressed at 500 kgf) containing the taste-masked granules have sufficient strength (the crushing strength: oxybutynin tablet, 3.5 kg; pirenzepine tablet, 2.2 kg), and a rapid disintegration time (within 20 s) was observed in the saliva of healthy volunteers. None of the volunteers felt any bitter taste after the disintegration of the tablet which contained the taste-masked granules. We confirmed that the rapidly disintegrating tablets can be prepared using these taste-masked granules and excipients which are commonly used in tablet preparation.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36568054", "33405012", "30311503", "29399545", "26216412", "24495274", "24079338", "24507296", "24184344", "24148666", "22985772", "23102011", "23180226", "22683694", "22247889", "21804234", "21414937", "21134862", "20410620", "20232267"], "label": "0"}

These adverse effects result from a lack of selectivity for the bladder over other organs. Although M2-muscarinic receptors are the predominant cholinoreceptor present in urinary bladder, the smaller population of M3-receptors appears to be the most functionally important and mediates direct contraction of the detrusor muscle. M2-receptors modulate detrusor contraction by several mechanisms and may contribute more to contraction of the bladder in pathologic states, such as bladder denervation or spinal cord injury. Prejunctional inhibitory M2-receptors or M4-receptors and prejunctional facilitatory M1-muscarinic receptors in the bladder have also been reported, but their relevance to the clinical effectiveness of muscarinic antagonists is unknown. In clinical studies, tolterodine, a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, has been reported to be equally effective to oxybutynin but to induce less dry mouth. Controlled-release and intravesical, intravaginal, and rectal administrations of oxybutynin have all been reported to cause fewer adverse effects. Conversely, darifenacin, a new M3-selective antagonist, has been reported to have selectivity for the bladder over the salivary gland in vivo. Whether M3-selective or nonselective muscarinic antagonists will be the most clinically effective for the overactive bladder-preserving the best balance between efficacy and tolerability-has yet to be established, and comparative clinical trials between compounds, such as darifenacin (M3 selective) and tolterodine (nonselective) will be required.", "outbound_citations": ["8133908", "9228673", "12123469", "11090124", "11113769", "10944224", "11193006", "10828671", "10828672", "10792154", "10759661", "10691817", "10711347", "10571617", "10524944", "10332441", "10223495", "10210432", "10210394", "10069506", "10069505", "10069504", "10069502", "10543335", "9933832", "9791087", "9720583", "9692772", "9666761", "9647869", "9671109", "9467475", "9829424", "9776013", "9426760", "9113359", "9072550", "8996405", "8981565", "8709348", "8564260", "7752101", "7788255", "7853228", "8016895", "7504306", "1328607", "1607601", "1654463", "2005707", "1771701", "2810112", "2849672", "6296468", "458990"], "inbound_citations": ["35793990", "35428429", "35469847", "33456366", "32884926", "32457631", "31996628", "29159581", "29410894", "28506859", "28716328", "28661264", "27075022", "27760081", "25001574", "24472109", "24798478", "23290148", "23372610", "22473872", "22745902", "22404481", "15482001", "21459965", "19771598"], "label": "0"}
