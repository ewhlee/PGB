The recommendation to delay triptan intake until headache intensity is at least moderate is merely a habit generated by the protocol used in triptan trials and a nonvalidated attempt to reduce costs. It is also favoured by the few studies suggesting that sumatriptan is less effective when given early in an attack, especially during the aura phase. Recent retrospective analyses of small numbers of 'protocol violators' in controlled trials of sumatriptan suggest that the drug is more efficient when taken while the headache is mild. Pain-free responses and therapeutic gains over aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)-metoclopramide or ergotamine-caffeine combinations were increased under these conditions. The available circumstantial evidence is reviewed and discussed. Before any conclusion can be drawn and recommendation made, results are awaited from randomised controlled trials specifically addressing whether or not triptans are more efficient in mild headache. Meanwhile, there seems to be no medical reason to withhold treatment of a mild headache with a triptan as long as triptan intake does not exceed 1 or 2 doses per week. Most mild headaches in patients with migraine appear indeed to be mild migraine attacks, even when the headache characteristics are those of tension-type headache.", "outbound_citations": ["11135022", "11135021", "11048903", "10908199", "10805332", "10759909", "10570730", "9827244", "9563208", "8710123", "8706118", "1313746", "1317294", "2036663", "1653136", "1653139", "9563207"], "inbound_citations": ["35977836", "32752932", "33008508", "30189270", "25934317"], "label": "0"}

Sumatriptan, an agonist of 5\u2010HT1\u2010like receptors, has proven effective in the treatment of cluster headache attacks. There are clear clinical similarities between chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and cluster headache. A natural consequence of these considerations would be to establish whether chronic paroxysmal hemicrania also responds similarly to sumatriptan. Since hemicrania continua is another unilateral headache responsive to indomethacin, it would be meaningful to also include hemicrania continua in such a study. Sumatriptan, 6 mg subcutaneous, was tried in an open fashion in 7 patients (6 women and 1 man) with chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and 7 patients (5 women and 2 men) with hemicrania continua. In chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, the mean interval between the last three attacks prior to sumatriptan treatment (40 \u00b1 23 minutes) was not statistically different from the mean interval between the three attacks subsequent to sumatriptan treatment of an attack (32 \u00b1 20 minutes).

Seven different triptans will soon be clinically available, making evidence-based selection guidelines necessary. Triptan trials have similar designs, facilitating meta-analysis; this will provide a foundation for using triptans in clinical practice. We asked pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigators of company-independent trials for raw patient data of all double-blind, randomised, controlled, clinical trials of oral triptans in migraine. We calculated summary estimates across studies for important efficacy and tolerability parameters, and separately summarised direct comparator trials. 53 clinical trials (12 unpublished) involving 24089 patients, met the criteria for inclusion. Mean results for 100 mg sumatriptan were 59% (95% CI 57-60) for 2 h headache response (improvement from moderate or severe to mild or no pain); 29% (27-30) for 2 h pain free (improvement to no pain); 20% (18-21) for sustained pain free (pain free by 2 h and no headache recurrence or use of rescue medication 2-24 h post dose); and 67% (63-70) for consistency (response in at least two of three treated attacks); placebo-subtracted proportions for patients with at least one adverse event (AE) were 13% (8-18), for at least one central nervous system AE 6% (3-9), and for at least one chest AE 1.9% (1.0-2.7). Compared with these data, 10 mg rizatriptan showed better efficacy and consistency, and similar tolerability; 80 mg eletriptan showed better efficacy, similar consistency, but lower tolerability; 12.5 mg almotriptan showed similar efficacy at 2 h but better other results; 2.5 mg naratriptan and 20 mg eletriptan showed lower efficacy and (the first two) better tolerability; 2.5 mg and 5 mg zolmitriptan, 40 mg eletriptan, and 5 mg rizatriptan showed very similar results. The results of the 22 trials that directly compared triptans show the same overall pattern. We received no data on frovatriptan, but publicly available data suggest lower efficacy. At marketed doses, all oral triptans were effective and well tolerated. 10 mg rizatriptan, 80 mg eletriptan, and 12.5 mg almotriptan provide the highest likelihood of consistent success.", "outbound_citations": ["12383060", "11737014", "11391905", "11293557", "10869781", "11094106", "11167908", "11167896", "11075838", "10611116", "10402569", "10099848", "9950449", "9827244", "9748025", "9665056", "9595867", "9563208", "9362987", "9139558", "8792039", "7697699", "7828190", "8019337", "8258424", "1792461", "1653136", "2252337", "3282670", "3048700", "3802833", "6815610", "4425854", "20769595"], "inbound_citations": ["37205173", "36804093", "36739516", "36400554", "36414952", "36239038", "36114949", "36112070", "35816257", "35546653", "35294047", "35177004", "35100579", "35027572", "34962845", "34667919", "34645382", "34685736", "34577624", "34227105", "34263680", "34243621", "34040231", "34030634", "33974014", "33874755", "33773612", "33583217", "33507529", "33464533", "33426614", "33246522", "33241721", "33227352", "33017476", "33093738", "33093740", "32955929", "32935848", "32718243", "33004160", "32573795", "32541386", "32447676", "32328974", "32359776", "32282119", "32200435", "32231578", "32166843", "32066464", "32012936", "31953213", "33008517", "31747304", "31737909", "31610206", "31550910", "31311674", "31331265", "31266353", "31135819", "30880256", "31166697", "31409292", "31132795", "31096904", "31074005", "31024319", "33791603", "30807986", "30845850", "30659611", "29616830", "30806518", "30795781", "30447001", "29767791", "30446595", "30508994", "30382909", "29987329", "30215543", "30242519", "30151604", "30112726", "30127722", "29800719", "30152161", "29907608", "29571016", "29878341", "29448820", "29460913", "29235068", "28581633", "28842982", "27521843", "28749698", "28741120", "27622427", "28286178", "28324697", "27873376", "28389966", "28251920", "28093722", "27696633", "28176235", "27312704", "27731896", "27338837", "27630773", "27075428", "27606340", "27917413", "27329280", "27582896", "27091593", "26645547", "27029382", "26878569", "26878379", "26189757", "27257569", "27093871"], "label": "1"}

This may lead to erratic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and make oral treatment unsatisfactory. For such patients, an intranasal formulation may be advantageous. Sumatriptan is a potent serotonin 5HT(1B/1D) agonist widely used in the treatment of migraine; the effectiveness of the intranasal formulation (20mg) has been well established in several clinical studies. This article reviews the pharmacokinetics of intranasal sumatriptan and includes comparisons with oral and subcutaneous administration. After intranasal administration, sumatriptan is directly and rapidly absorbed, with 60% of the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) occurring at 30 minutes after administration of a single 20mg dose. Following intranasal administration, approximately 10% more sumatriptan is absorbed probably via the nasal mucosa when compared with oral administration. Mean C(max) after a 20mg intranasal dose is approximately 13.1 to 14.4 ng/mL, with median time to C(max) approximately 1 to 1.75 hours. When given as a single dose, intranasal sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption and C(max) over the dose range 5 to 10mg, but not between 5 and 20mg for C(max). The elimination phase half-life is approximately 2 hours, consistent with administration by other routes. Sumatriptan is metabolised by monoamine oxidase (MAO; predominantly the A isozyme, MAO-A) to an inactive metabolite. Coadministration with a MAO-A inhibitor, moclobemide, leads to a significant increase in sumatriptan plasma concentrations and is contraindicated. Single-dose pharmacokinetics in paediatric and adolescent patients following intranasal sumatriptan were studied to determine the effect of changes in nasal morphology during growth, and of body size, on pharmacokinetic parameters. The pharmacokinetic profile observed in adults was maintained in the adolescent population; generally, factors such as age, bodyweight or height did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics. In children below 12 years, C(max) is comparable to that seen in adolescents and adults, but total exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity) was lower in children compared with older patients, especially in younger children treated with 5mg. Clinical experience suggests that intranasal sumatriptan has some advantages over the tablet (more rapid onset of effect and use in patients with gastrointestinal complaints) or subcutaneous (noninvasive and fewer adverse events) formulations.", "outbound_citations": ["10567953", "7870666", "7964913", "7724476", "8164015", "7768259", "11192144", "11061765", "10883409", "10595285", "10563228", "9872338", "9876882", "9827244", "9793702", "9617601", "9673807", "9795022", "9783675", "9371898", "9210982", "9232520", "9209776", "9004457", "8869824", "8675428", "8838438", "7672958", "7650235", "7851052", "7516861", "8161354", "7902233", "1321655", "1647495", "1659437", "1681162", "1851894", "1653135", "1741949", "1653138", "2889824", "1653141", "8739554", "10837576", "9673808", "9546526", "3048700"], "inbound_citations": ["36259482", "35759210", "35655105", "34923646", "32579251", "31241819", "30385844", "29760572", "29022755", "28597922", "28581633", "28605258", "26119828", "26136843", "25971759", "24681294", "24641436", "24289494", "24024605", "23463252", "23359002", "23013035", "22694484", "22806266", "23055737", "22352764", "24310425", "20932065"], "label": "0"}

Following administration of sumatriptan 100mg orally, relief of migraine headache (at 2 hours) was achieved in 50 to 67% of patients compared with 10 to 31% with placebo in controlled clinical trials. In a comparative study, oral administration of sumatriptan 100mg consistently achieved significantly greater response rates than a fixed combination of ergotamine 2mg plus caffeine 200mg during 3 consecutive migraine attacks (66 vs 48% for first attack). Oral sumatriptan 100mg was also more effective than aspirin 900mg plus metoclopramide 10mg orally in a similar study. In the majority of controlled clinical trials, headache relief (at 1 hour after administration) was achieved in 70 to 80% of patients with migraine receiving sumatriptan 6mg subcutaneously compared with 18 to 26% of placebo recipients. Approximately 40% of patients who initially responded to oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan experienced recurrence of their headache, usually within 24 hours, but the majority of these patients responded well to a further dose of sumatriptan. Patients with cluster headache were treated for acute attacks with sumatriptan 6mg subcutaneously or placebo in 2 crossover trials. Headache relief was achieved within 15 minutes in 74 and 75% of patients receiving sumatriptan in these studies compared with 26 and 35%, respectively, with placebo. Patients receiving sumatriptan 12mg had a similar response rate as those receiving 6mg, but the higher dose was associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Based on extensive safety data pooled from controlled clinical trials, sumatriptan is generally well tolerated and most adverse events are transient. The most frequently reported adverse events following oral administration include nausea, vomiting, malaise, fatigue and dizziness. Injection site reactions (minor pain and redness of brief duration) occur in approximately 40% of patients receiving subcutaneous sumatriptan, although the incidence appears to be markedly reduced when patients self-administer the drug with an auto-injector. Chest symptoms (mainly tightness and pressure) occur in 3 to 5% of sumatriptan recipients, but have not been associated with myocardial ischaemia except in a few isolated cases. Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischaemic heart disease, angina pectoris including Prinzmetal (variant) angina, previous myocardial infarction and uncontrolled hypertension, but is not contraindicated in patients with migraine and asthma. Data from long term studies in acute treatment of migraine and cluster headache suggest that sumatriptan remains effective and well tolerated over several months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "outbound_citations": ["9377591", "8251846", "8414324", "8105349", "8258424", "8099643", "8262783", "7903290", "7902233", "7693489", "8393474", "8394988", "8101325", "8396833", "8392150", "8395298", "8100026", "8395342", "8394301", "8372403", "8395345", "8395343", "8098831", "8389026", "8096980", "8096983", "8096565", "8388371", "8390743", "8387475", "8387474", "8437697", "8384612", "8384803", "8381056", "8381852", "8382200", "8388188", "7679029", "7691515", "8397171", "8327048", "8394239", "1320526", "1337261", "1333181", "1333934", "1335361", "1357514", "1357313", "1330318", "1327368", "1399559", "1328844", "1330643", "1326404", "1326401", "1326405", "1326402", "1321655", "1326500", "1324091", "2176936", "1653139", "2897560", "2544286", "2797214", "3694267", "1646776", "2544284", "1317294", "1655985", "1379707", "14409092", "2454066", "1314843", "1647496", "1327382", "2166920", "1589909", "1653135", "1327369", "6206779", "8096982", "2545459", "1320974", "1653142", "1379152", "5325360", "649386", "8386498", "2665245", "1653138", "2158835", "1322512", "7085263", "1653141", "2542039", "3532683", "5558779", "2521959", "1851894", "1313746", "1350038", "2272071", "1653136", "8164015", "14381915", "1647495", "1681162", "1663596", "1659437", "1646291", "3207357", "1660351", "8093509", "2326836", "1329294", "2544285", "2975354", "1653134", "1315562", "1699472", "1675143", "3399126", "1357515", "2553192", "1653137", "3048700", "5297855", "1653140", "2547733", "1676084", "1346679"], "inbound_citations": ["35881279", "33792938", "29203152", "29501863", "29493566", "26951335", "25078720", "24754925", "24398469", "23912626", "24353996", "23013035", "22384463", "22032973", "21697001", "21461652", "21107766"], "label": "0"}

The results of these studies and the findings of autoradiography and neuroimaging studies, pointed to a possible role of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor in the pathophysiology of OCD. Recently the selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist sumatriptan was used to further explore the role of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor in OCD. Equivocal results with respect to the increase of obsessive compulsive symptoms in patients with OCD were reported. In one study a significant increase in plasma growth hormone (GH) concentration was observed, although sumatriptan does not pass the blood-brain barrier. In order to further explore the role of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor in the pathophysiology of OCD, we performed this study, following the same design as Ho Pian et al. (Psychopharmacology 140:365-370). In the present study we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design with zolmitriptan (5 mg per os), a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist with better brain penetrating properties than sumatriptan. We could not detect any changes in obsessive compulsive symptoms, mood, or anxiety levels, although we found a (nonsignificant) increase in plasma GH levels. Based upon these findings, no evidence was found for a specific role of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor in OCD. It should be noted, however, that challenge studies in OCD are difficult to perform. Perhaps in the future better challenge paradigms will make it possible to further explore the role of specific receptor types in OCD.", "outbound_citations": ["10473025", "10463324", "10214535", "9928925", "9725543", "9572087", "9453273", "9399016", "9326750", "9193738", "9040124", "9056052", "8914109", "8838441", "7578657", "8035909", "8201248", "8420593", "1461802", "1728249", "2018816", "2203327", "2166920", "2746512", "3337615", "3675134", "6708733"], "inbound_citations": ["33751503", "29546551", "26919057", "23973315", "22608632", "22760159", "21920503", "21383250", "21936901"], "label": "0"}

Methods Seventeen patients with unilateral migraine headache were studied within 6 hours of onset. Blink reflexes were elicited with a standard stimulating electrode (standard blink reflex) and concentric stimulating electrode (nociception-specific blink reflex) during the acute migraine attack, after treatment with IV lysine acetylsalicylate (1,000 mg) or oral zolmitriptan (5 mg) and interictally. Results After standard stimulation, no differences were detected for the R1 and R2 onset latencies and areas under the curve (AUC) between the different time points and the headache and nonheadache side. Nociception-specific stimulation revealed a shortening of R2 onset latencies (44.3 \u00b1 5.4 ms for headache side vs 48.9 \u00b1 5.8 ms for nonheadache side) during the acute migraine attack compared with the headache-free interval (49.8 \u00b1 5.3 vs 49.8 \u00b1 4.5 ms). The AUC of the R2 increased on the headache side by 680% and on the nonheadache side by 230% compared with the headache-free interval. Drug treatment parallel to pain relief increased the onset latencies (zolmitriptan: 48.0 \u00b1 8.2 ms for headache side vs 52.3 \u00b1 7.6 ms for nonheadache side; lysine acetylsalicylate: 48.0 \u00b1 5.0 ms for headache side vs 51.2 \u00b1 5.6 ms for nonheadache side) and reduced the AUC of R2 (zolmitriptan by 45% and lysine acetylsalicylate by 48%).

Nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs, \u03b2\u2010blockers, and calcium channel\u2010blocking antagonists are used in the prophylaxis of migraine. Hence, there is a need to investigate the interaction of these prophylactic drugs with sumatriptan. The interaction of sumatriptan with propranolol, flunarizine, pizotifen, and butorphanol were reported earlier. Naproxen is shown to be effective in prophylactic treatment of migraine. In this study, the authors have investigated the circadian rhythm effect of naproxen on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan at 1000 and 2200 hours. Twelve healthy volunteers were treated with 100 mg sumatriptan succinate either alone or along with 500 mg naproxen orally at either 1000 or 2200 hours in a randomized Latin square design with a washout period of 10 days. Serum samples were collected at predetermined time intervals and analyzed for unchanged sumatriptan by high\u2010performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by using model\u2010independent methods. Naproxen had no statistically significant (p > 0.05) effect on any pharmacokinetic parameters of sumatriptan both at 1000 and 2200 hours treatment. The results of this study suggest that no alteration in the sumatriptan dosage will be necessary for migraine patients taking naproxen prophylactic therapy.", "outbound_citations": ["9739478", "8874985", "7650235", "7555001", "7851052", "7516861", "8381488", "1321655", "1659437", "1653135", "3179168", "3784702", "4022376", "3902723", "4004602", "6122461"], "inbound_citations": ["26865407", "23912627", "23018546"], "label": "0"}

Specific differences among the triptans exist as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including T1/2, Tmax, Cmax, AUC, metabolism, drug-drug interaction profiles, amongst other parameters. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and tolerability differences is not well differentiated. Clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle and proper choice of triptan requires attention to the specific characteristics of each individual patient, knowledge of patient preference, accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute care medications as well as individual features of the drug being considered. Delivery systems may play an important role in the onset of action of triptans. The selection of an acute antimigraine drug for a patient depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases, and concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. The clinician has in his armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of medications, available in multiple formulations and dosages, with good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to optimize therapeutic benefit.", "outbound_citations": ["11972576", "11993610", "12229911", "11576198", "11559322", "11678811", "11264695", "11078003", "11014417", "10817444", "10636142", "11041768", "11089515", "10214771", "10640258", "11284462", "9536565", "9371896", "9371898", "9399016", "1653135", "2544280", "246641"], "inbound_citations": ["36108289", "33208542", "32579251", "32320670", "29869307", "29235068", "28729175", "28375038", "28078629", "27310148", "25998990", "25249023", "24865446", "24102636", "23483096", "23153670", "23013035", "24654726", "22762358", "22221151", "20687618", "21942531", "21929465", "20647176"], "label": "0"}

Thirty-five symptomatic episodic migraine patients were enrolled in this study, comparing 40 minutes of bilateral intraoral chilling, 50 mg of oral sumatriptan, and 40 minutes of sham (tongue) chilling. Hollow metal tubes chilled by circulating ice water were held in the maxillary molar periapical areas by the patient. Pain and nausea were recorded at baseline and 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours after start of treatment, using a numeric symptom-relief scale. Significant mean headache relief was obtained by maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at all four time intervals, with poor relief obtained by placebo. Maxillary chilling was more effective than sumatriptan at all four time intervals. Significant nausea relief was obtained by maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at posttreatment and 2 and 4 hours later. At 24 hours, some headache and nausea recurrence was noted with sumatriptan. The repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that both treatments, drug (P = 0.024) and maxillary chilling (P = 0.001), reduced the headache, as compared with the control group.

Assessments of treatment efficacy have tended to focus on migraine symptoms, rather than looking at functional impact. This study compared the efficacy of different oral triptans for restoring normal function in migraine sufferers. Methods: Retrospective subgroup analysis of data from five randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials in which oral rizatriptan was directly compared with oral sumatriptan 100 mg (772 attacks), 50 mg (2,227 attacks), and 25 mg (1,182 attacks), naratriptan 2.5 mg (413 attacks), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (578 attacks) for the acute treatment of a moderate or severe migraine attack. Functional disability was evaluated by patients on a 4-grade scale (\u2018normal\u2019, \u2018mild impairment\u2019, \u2018severe impairment\u2019, \u2018requires bedrest\u2019) at baseline and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 h after dosing. This analysis looked at the percentage of patients who had normal functional ability at 2 h, the last time point before escape medications were allowed, in the subgroup of patients who had some level of disability at baseline. Results: Most patients in each trial and treatment group had some level of disability at baseline (range = 94\u2013100%). At 2 h, more patients on rizatriptan 10 mg were able to function normally compared with sumatriptan 100 mg (39 vs. 32%, odds ratio = 1.4, p = 0.021), sumatriptan 50 mg (47 vs. 42%, odds ratio = 1.2, p = 0.033), sumatriptan 25 mg (48 vs. 36%, odds ratio = 1.7, p < 0.001), naratriptan 2.5 mg (39 vs. 22%, odds ratio = 2.5, p < 0.001), and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (45 vs. 36%, odds ratio = 1.6, p = 0.008).

Sumatriptan is available as an injection for subcutaneous administration and as a tablet for oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan differ depending on the route of administration. The mean subcutaneous bioavailability is 96% compared to 14% for the oral tablet. The lower bioavailability following oral administration is due mainly to presystemic metabolism. The inter-subject variability in plasma sumatriptan concentrations is greater following oral administration and a faster rate of absorption of drug into the systemic circulation is achieved following subcutaneous dosing. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan are linear up to a subcutaneous dose of 16 mg. Following oral dosing up to 400 mg, the pharmacokinetics are also linear, with the exception of rate of absorption, as indicated by a dose dependent increase in time to peak concentration. Sumatriptan is a highly cleared compound that is eliminated from the body primarily by metabolism to the pharmacologically inactive indoleacetic acid analogue. Both sumatriptan and its metabolite are excreted in the urine. Although the renal clearance of sumatriptan is only 20% of the total clearance, it exceeds the glomerular filtration rate, indicating that sumatriptan undergoes active renal tubular secretion. Sumatriptan has a large apparent volume of distribution (170 l) and an elimination half-life of 2 h.

Of the 3 isoforms, endothelin-1 is the major isoform produced by the vascular endothelium and is, therefore, likely to be of most importance for regulation of vascular function. Two endothelin receptor subtypes have so far been cloned in mammalian species; ET A, and ET B. Both receptor subtypes are found on smooth muscle cells and mediate the vasoconstrictor and pressor actions of endothelin. The ET B receptor is also found on vascular endothelial cells and mediates endothelin-dependent vasodilatation through release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. Since their discovery in 1988, the endothelins have been the subject of intense research on their physiological function and potential pathophysiological role in cardiovascular disease. There is now good evidence that endothelin regulates vascular tone and blood pressure, and studies to support the development of endothelin receptor antagonists in conditions associated with chronic vasoconstriction, such as hypertension and heart failure, as well as in vasospastic disorders, such as subarachnoid haemorrhage and Raynaud's disease. There are now a number of selective ET A and combined ET A/B receptor antagonists available for preclinical studies.

This was a Phase II multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-finding study conducted over 7 months at 13 practice-oriented centers and 1 larger research-focused center. Patients experiencing moderate to severe migraine with or without aura, as defined by International Headache Society criteria, were randomly assigned to receive a single subcutaneous dose of almotriptan 2, 6, or 10 mg or placebo. The primary end point, pain relief at 2 hours, was self-assessed on a 4-point scale (severe, moderate, mild, or no pain). Patients indicating mild or no pain were considered responders. The analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. A total of 123 patients were enrolled (23 men, 100 women). Overall, almotriptan 6 and 10 mg were significantly more effective than placebo (P < 0.05, Fisher exact test). Response rates for the 6- and 10-mg doses were 96.5% and 90.3%, respectively, compared with 50.0% for placebo (P < 0.05, Fisher exact test). The proportion of patients with pain relief at 2 hours was not significantly different between almotriptan 2 mg and placebo. The response profile for the secondary end points was also better with almotriptan 6 and 10 mg than with placebo. Administration of almotriptan was well tolerated; the most frequently observed drug-associated adverse event was transient local irritation at the injection site.

Data from two large clinical trials with identical designs were included in a retrospective analysis.

Women with migraines were randomly assigned to one of five treatment sequences for the treatment of two migraine attacks. Only data from the first attack in women with migraines who were treated with rizatriptan or placebo were included in the analysis. A menstrually associated attack was defined as one that occurred within 3 days before or after the onset of the last menstrual period.

Recent animal and human studies examining these headaches indicate that the nociceptive input to the central nervous system (CNS) may be increased due to activation or sensitization of peripheral sensory afferents. The barrage of nociceptive impulses may result in sensitization of second- and third-order neurons in the CNS. In this way, sensitization may play a role in initiation and maintenance of migraine and tension-type headache. It is likely that the effects of established medication for both disorders may be partly due to a reduction in sensitization. Several interesting drugs that counteract sensitization are under development, and targeting this mode of action seems to be a promising way of improving the treatment for these prevalent disorders.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34055341", "29961622", "26440358"], "label": "0"}

This article reviews evidence from retrospective analyses and prospective studies showing that sumatriptan injection and tablets are effective and well tolerated in menstrual migraine. (1) Sumatriptan injection 6 mg was as effective in the treatment of menstrual migraine attacks as it was for nonmenstrual attacks in a retrospective analysis of data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials (n = 1104). In the menstrual migraine group, 80% of women treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg compared with 19% of placebo-treated patients reported headache relief 1 h postdose (p< 0.001). (2) Sumatriptan injection 6 mg was effective in the acute treatment of menstrual migraine attacks in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, two-attack study (n=226). Across the two attacks, 70-71% of patients treating menstrual migraine attacks with sumatriptan injection 6 mg compared with 22-24% of placebo-treated patients reported headache relief 1 h postdose (p< 0.001). (3) Sumatriptan tablets 100 mg were effective in the acute treatment of menstrual migraine attacks in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in women diagnosed with menstrual migraine (n = 115). For menstrual migraine attacks, headache relief 4 h postdose was reported by 67% of sumatriptan-treated patients compared with 33% of placebo-treated patients. Sumatriptan injection and tablets were generally well tolerated in these studies, in which adverse events were characteristic of those typically observed in sumatriptan acute migraine clinical trials.

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the encapsulation methods used to mask active drug may delay absorption of sumatriptan from dosing to 2 hours after dosing (the traditional end point in clinical trials of migraine treatment), an effect that may be enhanced by migraine-associated gastric stasis. Two randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover trials were conducted to evaluate the absorption and bioequivalence of conventional 50-mg sumatriptan tablets and encapsulated 50-mg sumatriptan tablets in supine, fasted, healthy volunteers (Glaxo Wellcome protocol SUM40270) and supine patients experiencing a migraine (Glaxo Wellcome protocol SUM40268). Absorption was assessed by calculating the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from dosing to 2 hours after dosing (AUC2) and the times to first measurable plasma concentration, 10 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and maximum plasma concentration. Data for the AUC from time zero to infinity and maximum plasma concentration were used to assess standard bioequivalence, which is considered to occur when the 90% CIs for the geometric mean treatment ratios (test/reference) fall between 0.8 and 1.25. Study 1 included 26 healthy subjects (73% men, 27% women; mean age, 39.1 years), and study 2 included 30 patients with migraine (67% women, 33% men; mean age, 42.7 years). Sumatriptan absorption was delayed with the encapsulated tablet compared with the conventional tablet 0 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during a migraine. AUC2 values with encapsulated sumatriptan compared with the conventional tablet were 21% lower in healthy volunteers (ratio of capsule/tablet, 0.79; 90% CI, 0.588-1.050) and 27% lower in patients experiencing a migraine (ratio of capsule/tablet, 0.73; 90% CI, 0.519-1.023). Standard bioequivalence was demonstrated in both healthy volunteers and patients experiencing a migraine. Encapsulation delayed absorption of sumatriptan 0 to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during a migraine.

The gastrointestinal motor correlates of vomiting consist of a stereotyped motor response to diverse stimuli and basically include gastric relaxation and a series of events (intestinal motor inhibition and disruption of slow wave activity) in preparation for the occurrence of a retrograde giant contraction that propagates orally and empties intestinal contents into the stomach. These motor correlates always accompany vomiting, but may also appear as an independent phenomenon. Antidopaminergic agents, such as metoclopramide and domperidone, have antiemetic/prokinetic properties, block the gastrointestinal motor correlates of vomiting and may speed up absorption of antimigraine agents. The use of 5-HT4 receptor agonists may be an alternative strategy to achieve prokinesia during a migraine attack, although this issue still needs to be fully addressed by controlled studies. Sumatriptan was found to induce gastric relaxation and delay gastric emptying, but the impact of these effects during a migraine attack remains to be determined.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36606433", "34428465", "30361855", "27688656"], "label": "0"}

Methods: Data from published, randomized, placebo-controlled trials were pooled and a combined number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) was generated for each triptan. Direct comparative trials of triptans were also examined. Results: The lowest NNTfor headache response/pain-free at one/two hours is observed with subcutaneous sumatriptan. Among the oral formulations, the lowest NNT is observed with rizatriptan and the highest NENT with naratriptan. The lowest NNH is observed with subcutaneous sumatriptan. Conclusions: Triptans are relatively safe and effective medications for acute migraine attacks. However, differences among them are relatively small.

The broad spectrum of activity at other monoamine receptors is responsible for their side effect profile (dysphoria, nausea, emesis, unnecessary vascular effects). Both ergotamine and dihydroergotamine have sustained vasoconstrictor actions. In acute migraine treatment, their mechanisms of action involve constricting the pain\u2010producing intracranial extracerebral blood vessels at the 5\u2010HT1B receptors and inhibiting the trigeminal neurotransmission at the peripheral and central 5\u2010HT1D receptors.

Compounds interacting with 5-HT1F, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors are currently under investigation and may prove to have important therapeutic applications in the future.", "outbound_citations": ["11474424", "11489456", "11489455", "11442897", "11489457", "11488362", "11457419", "11339972", "11310815", "11349480", "11343529", "11270910", "11229789", "11166513", "11199945", "11577786", "11277607", "11116281", "11526472", "11599651", "11527001", "11212591", "11414552", "11108789", "11082417", "11195269", "11006462", "10940449", "10926052", "10980257", "11105933", "11021352", "10974485", "11110014", "11110016", "10954872", "10883409", "11026974", "10795609", "10836139", "10720725", "10890313", "10928313", "10719157", "10737747", "10664612", "11060667", "10821328", "10821327", "11249543", "10761680", "10937459", "10637649", "10857385", "11319571", "10594669", "10643820", "10571599", "10580922", "10462132", "10462127", "10487254", "10487252", "10487253", "10429738", "10471170", "10471168", "10932681", "10219775", "10344784", "10188965", "9934946", "9934947", "10515304", "10487251", "9836014", "9776361", "9851577", "9829021", "9829023", "9808078", "10065917", "9690962", "9532345", "9541154", "9551765", "9501884", "9809223", "9811430", "9809222", "9660109", "9413418", "9336689", "9225280", "9130039", "9361339", "8863556", "8914117", "8887989", "8705226", "8788525", "8749037", "8602893", "7617188", "7616396", "7663840", "7700379", "7779245", "7530204", "7814828", "7940983", "8122960", "8279933", "8281439", "8104044", "1385390", "1352034", "1546547", "1728249", "1752858", "1653134", "2066767", "1665260", "2252319", "2205172", "1968223", "2859581", "6788351", "6935934", "971028", "5319766", "14229500", "13460238", "13172437", "16589461"], "inbound_citations": ["36013918", "34516379", "34248666", "33052620", "32805212", "32035145", "31356761", "30817822", "31201245", "31203804", "29448224", "29382554", "29425245", "28280410", "27013075", "27150816", "27061981", "27099073", "26979101", "25788672", "25637882", "25234191", "24666297", "25187179", "24676701", "24486730", "24324783", "23865625", "24041919", "24013211", "23683593", "23741451", "24285316", "22339950", "23152619", "22685342", "22421069", "21774748", "22619602", "22309909", "22013233", "21960253", "21272662", "21619890", "21527662", "21570927", "21660287", "21192076", "20980153", "20849926", "20621123", "20655748", "20447448", "20610865", "20557570", "20083209", "20233210", "20349263", "20138771"], "label": "0"}

Patients treated three migraine attacks with study medication; a second, optional dose was available for treating recurrent headache. Of the 560 patients randomized, 485 treated at least one attack, 411 at least two attacks, and 362 three attacks. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients who had obtained complete or almost complete headache relief at 4 h after dosing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor all attacks, a significantly greater proportion of patients experienced headache relief at 4 h with sumatriptan 50 mg tablets than with placebo (59% to 62% versus 32% to 42%; P = 0.005). The same was true at 3 h across all attacks, and at 2 h for attacks 1 and 2 (49% versus 23% and 45% versus 29%, respectively). Although sumatriptan and placebo were associated with similar incidences of recurrence, sumatriptan was associated with a longer time to recurrence. The incidence of adverse events with sumatriptan was similar to that with placebo, and there was no increase in adverse events associated with use of a second dose to treat recurrence.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSumatriptan 50 mg tablets are well tolerated and efficacious in relieving migraine headache.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34633423", "27521843", "23786565", "22336868", "22336784", "16097844"], "label": "1"}

It has been reported previously that clonidine can potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis on the pain-free side of cluster headache patients. We examined whether a single oral dose of clonidine (200 micrograms) can also potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis in healthy subjects, using mydriasis to methoxamine, a directly acting sympathomimetic amine, as a control. 2. Eight healthy male volunteers participated in four weekly sessions. In the first two sessions (Experiment 1) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to tyramine hydrochloride eyedrops (75 mM; 2 x 10 microliters), and in the last two sessions (Experiment 2) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to methoxamine hydrochloride eyedrops (20 mM; 2 x 10 microliters) was examined. In both experiments subjects were allocated to drugs and sessions according to a double-blind balanced design. In both experiments, pupil diameter of both the treated and the untreated eyes was recorded in standard ambient light and in the dark, before, and 2 h after clonidine/placebo, via binocular infrared television pupillometry. Salivation (dental roll technique), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sitting), heart rate, and self-ratings of mood and feelings (visual analogue scales), were also measured before, and 2 h after the ingestion of clonidine or placebo. 3. Both tyramine and methoxamine produced a significant mydriasis, which was more prominent in the light condition (change in resting pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: tyramine/light 1.05 +/- 0.28; tyramine/dark: 0.73 +/- 0.15; methoxamine/light: 1.65 +/- 0.28; methoxamine/dark: 0.85 +/- 0.15). Clonidine produced a significant miosis in the untreated eye which was more prominent in the light condition (change in resting pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: Experiment 1, light: -1.34 +/- 0.19; Experiment 1, dark: -0.46 +/- 0.1; Experiment 2, light -0.97 +/- 0.18; Experiment 2, dark: -0.29 +/- 0.17). Clonidine had no significant effect on either tyramine- or methoxamine-evoked mydriasis. 4. In agreement with previous reports, clonidine significantly reduced salivation (g, mean +/- s.e.mean; Experiment 1: -0.84 +/- 0.22; Experiment 2: -0.55 +/- 0.11), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 1: -17.5 +/- 3.76; Experiment 2: -23.38 +/- 4.67), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 2: -12.38 +/- 2.05), alertness (mm; Experiment 2: -24.19 +/- 5.40), and anxiety (mm; Experiment 1: -13.82 +/- 4.60), indicating the presence of pharmacodynamically effective tissue levels of the drug. 5. These results show that a single oral dose (200 micrograms) of clonidine causes significant miosis in human subjects, and fails to potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis. This indicates that the pupil on the asymptomatic side of cluster headache patients is affected differently from the pupils of healthy volunteers by tyramine and/or clonidine.", "outbound_citations": ["2015177", "2368824", "2804539", "3242574", "22156073", "4005103", "6725854", "6897524", "7295459", "759408", "5571230", "5093959", "4899510", "14431290"], "inbound_citations": ["33751656", "30714782", "30619035"], "label": "0"}

Although considerable progress has been made, the pathophysiology of migraine is still not understood. However, several observations point to an involvement of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Migraine headache involves the activation of the trigeminal system and dilatation of cranial vessels. CGRP is localized to neurons in the trigeminal ganglia and CGRP levels are increased during a migraine attack, presumably causing the vasodilation observed. Accordingly, it is conceivable that inhibition of CGRP-evoked dilatation of the cranial vessels may provide a novel treatment for migraine headache. The non-peptidic CGRP antagonist BIBN-4096BS (Boehringer Ingelheim) is presently under clinical investigation to assess the importance of CGRP in migraine headache and to answer the question of whether the concept of CGRP antagonists may offer advantages, e.g., higher efficacy, lower recurrence rate or improved side-effect profile, compared to the currently used antimigraine drugs.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["28699403", "28001346", "24101849", "23473785", "21631491", "21352215", "21207080", "20655327"], "label": "0"}

Earlier clinical trials demonstrated that rizatriptan 5 or 10mg is more effective than placebo at providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated symptoms of migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient quality of life, and showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recently, rizatriptan 10mg was shown to be more effective than zolmitriptan 2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at producing a pain-free state 2 hours postdose. Furthermore, compared with naratriptan, significantly more patients who received rizatriptan were pain free or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. The number of patients with normal functional ability at 2 hours was significantly higher after rizatriptan than after naratriptan or zolmitriptan. Rizatriptan was also generally more effective than zolmitriptan or naratriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms. Rizatriptan is generally well tolerated and adverse events are usually mild and transient. The most common adverse events associated with rizatriptan in recent randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. There was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan compared with zolmitriptan (31.2 vs 38.8%). However, rizatriptan was associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan (39 vs 29%). The incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of rizatriptan, zolmitriptan or naratriptan (2 to 4%). Rizatriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. Oral rizatriptan 5 and 10mg have shown greater efficacy than placebo in providing pain relief, an absence of pain, relief from associated symptoms, normal functional ability and an improvement in patient quality of life. Earlier results showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recent studies have shown that rizatriptan 10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage of patients with an absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than naratriptan 2.5mg or zolmitriptan 2.5mg. The efficacy of rizatriptan is retained when used in the long term and the drug is generally well tolerated. Although well designed studies comparing rizatriptan with almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan would further define the position of rizatriptan, current data suggest rizatriptan should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management of migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["11817980", "12005302", "11807151", "12005275", "12229911", "11680669", "11687054", "11728541", "11695077", "11576198", "11678812", "11559322", "11559323", "11576197", "11487512", "11554952", "11453892", "11480267", "11448293", "11531898", "11549974", "11440281", "11430173", "11385269", "11264686", "11422095", "11252291", "11471758", "11460889", "11327198", "10869781", "11078004", "11167896", "11061582", "10993991", "11004939", "10908770", "10986188", "10883409", "10849042", "11037741", "10849030", "10709161", "10666545", "10631625", "11089513", "11089519", "10611145", "11089514", "11126097", "11089517", "11089515", "11152011", "10611116", "10551439", "10529545", "10570730", "10417495", "10453967", "10473025", "10563228", "10526677", "10408532", "10463512", "15992122", "10233200", "10099848", "11563413", "10487511", "10487508", "10367177", "9862247", "11284462", "9876882", "9825951", "11284463", "9748025", "9665056", "9617601", "9595867", "9482363", "9453271", "9350384", "9203569", "9203565", "9223767", "9225275", "9056052", "8904614", "8700126", "8634619", "8733984", "8742682", "8991488", "8527286", "7672955", "8170966", "7516861", "8492007", "1399554", "1676084", "1699472", "11478927", "10921808", "10890255", "11284383", "11673575", "10403069", "11735616", "10534294", "11595011", "10487510", "10214531", "11139745", "9546526", "9601619", "3048700", "11284464"], "inbound_citations": ["37114772", "27267071", "26289138", "21437714", "20686810"], "label": "0"}

Demographic, baseline, health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction rating data were collected during visits to the clinic. Data relating to migraine symptoms, migraine therapy, work productivity and non-work activity time were collected on diary cards filled out by the patients. 749 patients were recruited to the study and 637 received at least 1 dose of sumatriptan. Overall, 75.5% of migraines were successfully treated within 2 hours with sumatriptan compared with 31.9% with customary therapy; 36% of patients reported complete relief at 2 hours with sumatriptan treatment compared with 1% of patients receiving customary therapy. 69% of patients successfully treated 70% of their migraines with sumatriptan within 2 hours, compared with 12% of patients with customary therapy. No serious adverse events were reported; 50% of patients reported an adverse event during the 12-week customary therapy phase and 89% of patients during the 24-week sumatriptan phase.

The safety and tolerability of these drugs have been extensively investigated since the first triptan (sumatriptan) became commercially available. A report on a very large population of patients tested during clinical trials and in postmarketing studies, confirms that these drugs are safe and well tolerated when correctly used. Adverse events are frequently reported, but are usually mild and only a few patients discontinue therapy because of them. These adverse events include, in particular, the so-called 'triptan symptoms' (tingling, sensation of warmth, etc.). The exact mechanism of chest symptoms reported by 20% of patients with migraine treated with triptans remains unclear, but are exceptionally related to a cardiac mechanism. CNS adverse events (i.e. somnolence) are also reported, but it is a matter of debate whether they are related to the pharmacological properties (i.e. lipophilicity) of the drug or are symptoms of the disease itself. The potential risk for drug overuse must be taken into account when the triptans are given to patients with a high frequency of migraine attacks. Clinical interaction of triptans with other drugs metabolised in the liver may theoretically influence the incidence of adverse events, but there is little evidence to support this assumption. There is no evidence of a teratogenic risk of triptans in pregnant women taking these drugs.", "outbound_citations": ["10213372", "8164015", "12391349", "12383060", "11728541", "11706113", "11675061", "11576198", "11559322", "11513839", "11531900", "11371755", "11422001", "11385257", "11380643", "11318881", "11264684", "11401410", "11226138", "11252291", "11207394", "11168604", "11445657", "11327198", "11134654", "11134656", "11134655", "11078005", "11167908", "11050304", "11167896", "11206863", "11167903", "10891912", "10940090", "10940089", "11075844", "10883409", "10820137", "10824628", "10805332", "10961768", "10759909", "10636142", "10759898", "11089514", "10649172", "10524661", "10563228", "10563229", "10421332", "10430113", "10443565", "10499171", "10376167", "10385240", "10214771", "10193663", "9950449", "10386329", "9869507", "9827246", "9827245", "9759693", "10210876", "9748059", "9710039", "9745358", "9665056", "9617601", "9489518", "9463456", "9453273", "9403280", "9399007", "9384509", "9517443", "9399013", "9399014", "9270596", "9209776", "9209775", "9229132", "9205951", "9170336", "9050026", "9071263", "8955268", "8980858", "8922732", "8700126", "8710123", "8792039", "8798304", "8682677", "8848181", "8848207", "8550361", "8550362", "7986182", "7832891", "7934431", "7828190", "7909130", "7516861", "7693489", "8397070", "8388188", "8394239", "1727198", "1889975", "1653142", "1653136", "1941010", "1699472", "2574777", "2544285", "2544288", "2542039", "6206779", "11152011", "9601622", "9829155", "9563207", "9399016", "2077532", "11200789", "10455274", "11037743", "10463349", "3048700", "8525351", "11094108", "11284464"], "inbound_citations": ["36705316", "34057676", "32419007", "31712099", "31318457", "30704678", "29806076", "27073073", "23794637", "22272067", "21118096", "20592298", "20511208"], "label": "1"}

As with any other acute treatment for migraine, headache recurrence may occur in up to one-third of responders. Combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to reduce the incidence of headache recurrence in clinical practice. Rofecoxib is a member of a new class of NSAIDs, which selectively inhibits the COX-2 enzyme and therefore is associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal side-effects; the drug has a long plasma half-life (17 h). This open label study compared rizatriptan with rizatriptan plus rofecoxib in the acute treatment of migraine. Fifty-six triptan naive patients from a tertiary centre (37 women and 19 men, ages 16-55 years, mean 35 years) with International Headache Society migraine were randomized into two groups. They were instructed to treat three consecutive moderate or severe attacks with either 10 mg rizatriptan (group 1: 18 women and 10 men) or with 10 mg rizatriptan plus 25 mg rofecoxib (group 2: 19 women and 9 men). The presence of headache and nausea at 1, 2 and 4 h, and of side-effects, use of rescue medication and recurrence were compared. Fifty-four patients completed the study. Group 1 treated 76 attacks and group 2 treated 81 attacks. Absence of headache at 1 h was seen in 19 attacks (25%) in group 1 and in 34 attacks (42%) in group 2 (P = 0.082); at 2 h absence of headache was seen in 60% of group 1 attacks and in 76% of group 2 attacks (P = 0.115). At 4 h, 75% of group 1 attacks and 88% of group 2 attacks were pain free (P = 0.122). With regard to nausea, of those who had nausea at baseline, 31% and 49% of attacks in groups 1 and 2, respectively, were nausea free at 1 h (P = 0.091), 75% and 79% at 2 h (P = 0.736) and 82% and 91% (P = 0.479) at 4 h. Recurrence, based on all attacks of those patients who achieved pain free at 4 h, was observed in 53% of group 1 and 20% of group 2 attacks (P< 0.001). Sustained pain- free rates (for the 4-h time point) were 45.6% of group 1 and 78.9% of group 2 attacks. There were no significant differences with regard to rescue medication consumption after 4 h and side-effects in both groups. There was a non-significant trend for the combination group to have a higher response rate. The group treated with rizatriptan and rofecoxib had a lower recurrence rate than the group treated with rizatriptan. This study demonstrated that combining a fast acting triptan such as rizatriptan with rofecoxib reduced headache recurrence rates, was well tolerated and may be more effective than the use of rizatriptan alone. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations.", "outbound_citations": ["11422095", "11299430", "11087881", "11115219", "10920403", "10580458", "10234467", "10099848", "11284463", "9827244", "9595867", "9504998", "9229578"], "inbound_citations": ["31446449", "31563229", "27957624", "25773005", "25659588", "25056381", "24363238", "23116251", "21883200", "21453539", "20931348"], "label": "0"}

After completion of the study, the patients were also asked to indicate which treatment they preferred, based on efficacy, side effects, and handling of the preparation. Forty-nine of the 52 treatments with injection resulted in complete relief of pain within 15 min, with a mean of 9.6 min. The remaining three attacks were reduced by a mean of 86.7% at 15 min. Only 7 of the 52 treatments with nasal spray in the nostril ipsilateral to pain resulted in complete relief within this time period, with a mean of 13.0 min. In 18 of these treatments pain was reduced by a mean of 42.2% at 15 min, whereas no effect on pain was obtained at this time in the remaining 27 treatments. The effect was almost identical when the nasal spray was administered in the nostril on the non-painful side. As an overall judgement, only 2 of the 26 patients preferred nasal spray to injection.

The efficacy of oral rizatriptan (5 or 10 mg) has been demonstrated in large (n = 309 to 1746) well designed comparative trials with placebo and oral sumatriptan. Two hours postdose, rizatriptan 5 or 10 mg was more effective than placebo at producing pain relief or a pain free status, relieving migraine-associated symptoms and normalising functional ability. In general, rizatriptan 10 mg appeared to be more effective than rizatriptan 5 mg. However, recurrence rates with rizatriptan 5 and 10 mg appeared to be similar to those with placebo. Patients were significantly more likely to achieve pain relief within 2 hours after receiving rizatriptan 5 mg than sumatriptan 25 mg and after rizatriptan 10 mg than sumatriptan 50 mg. This was also observed with rizatriptan 10 mg compared with sumatriptan 100 mg according to an age-adjusted and a prespecified per-protocol analysis. In general, rizatriptan was better than sumatriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms, particularly nausea, and in normalising functional ability depending on which doses were compared. The incidence of headache recurrence, time to onset of recurrence and the need for escape medication in nonresponders appeared to be similar between rizatriptan and sumatriptan. Over the 24 hours after the dose, rizatriptan 10 mg improved the quality of life of patients with migraine compared with placebo. Rizatriptan 10 mg also significantly improved work function compared with placebo and with sumatriptan 50 mg. Rizatriptan appears to be well tolerated with most adverse events being mild and transient. The most commonly experienced events included general digestive complaints, general neurological complaints, dizziness, somnolence, asthenia/fatigue and pain and pressure sensations. In clinical trials, the overall incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan 5 or 10 mg was similar to that with sumatriptan 25 or 50 mg but lower than that with sumatriptan 100 mg. Chest pain was reported by 1 to 3% of rizatriptan recipients and by 3 to 6% of patients receiving sumatriptan (25, 50 or 100 mg); clinically significant effects on ECG parameters, heart rate or blood pressure were not observed with rizatriptan. Rizatriptan produces pain relief and a pain free status, relieves associated symptoms of migraine, normalises functional ability and improves patient quality of life. Rizatriptan 10 mg appears to be more effective than rizatriptan 5 mg. In comparison with oral sumatriptan, rizatriptan may provide better relief from pain and nausea, with some evidence of a faster onset of action. Thus, rizatriptan 5 or 10 mg is likely to establish a place as an effective and well tolerated agent for the management of acute migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["10233200", "11563413", "9862247", "9872339", "11284462", "11284463", "9748025", "9665056", "9617601", "9595867", "9453276", "9350384", "9203569", "9203565", "9009469", "9056052", "8912486", "8904614", "8634619", "8733984", "8991488", "8527286", "1699472", "10403069", "9145054", "11284464"], "inbound_citations": ["34613746", "30806518"], "label": "0"}

Of patients expressing a preference (89.1%), more than twice as many preferred rizatriptan to ergotamine/caffeine (69.9 vs. 30.1%, p \u2264 0.001). Faster relief of headache was the most important reason for preference, cited by 67.3% of patients preferring rizatriptan and 54.2% of patients who preferred ergotamine/caffeine. The co-primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of rizatriptan. Forty-nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan, compared with 24.3% treated with ergotamine/caffeine (p \u2264 0.001), rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment. Headache relief at 2 h was 75.9% for rizatriptan and 47.3% for ergotamine/caffeine (p \u2264 0.001), with rizatriptan being superior to ergotamine/caffeine within 30 min of dosing. Almost 36% of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h, compared to 20% of patients on ergotamine/caffeine (p \u2264 0.001). Rizatriptan was also superior to ergotamine/caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea, vomiting, phonophobia or photophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake (p \u2264 0.001).

We undertook this questionnaire-based study as a substudy of a multicenter trial of rizatriptan effectiveness. Our goal was to assess the history of acute migraine medication use and the relationship between different migraine medication regimens and patient satisfaction with prior therapy. This study was conducted at 85 neurology clinics throughout Spain from March Lo December 2001. It was planned prospectively as part of the screening visit for a multicenter trial of the effectiveness of rizatriptan therapy for migraine. Male and female patients >/=18 years of age were eligible for the primary trial, and hence for this study, if they had a history of migraine attacks and did not have a contraindication for triptan use. At the screening visit for the primary trial, a questionnaire was used by clinicians to record past and current use, and duration and order of use, of analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ergot derivatives, and triptans; satisfaction with treatment was scored on a 5-point scale ranging from \"very dissatisfied\" to \"very satisfied.\" Of 712 patients completing the questionnaire (mean [SD] age, 34 [10] years; range, 18-69 years), 75% were women and 94% experienced moderate or severe functional disability during migraine attacks. Analgesics were used by the majority of patients (81%) and for the longest mean [SD] duration (8.8 [7.6] years) but were associated with the least satisfaction (10% of patients \"very satisfied\" or \"somewhat satisfied\"). Triptans were used by the fewest patients (32%) and for the shortest mean duration (18 [1.6] years) but were associated with the highest rate of satisfaction (66%) compared with NSAIDs (27%) and ergot derivatives (31%). Regardless of duration or order of drug use, or sex or age of the patient, the likelihood of satisfaction with triptans was significantly greater (P < 0.001) than with nontriptan regimens, with an adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 16.8 (11.4-24.9) versus analgesics, 5.1 (3.6-7.1) versus NSAIDs, and 4.1 (2.8-6.0) versus ergot derivatives. Our results showed that analgesics, NSAIDs, and ergot derivatives were used for long durations but provided low satisfaction among patients. Triptans were rarely used as a first treatment choice; however, patients reported the highest treatment satisfaction scores after triptan therapy compared with ergot derivatives, NSAIDs, or analgesics.", "outbound_citations": ["12578925", "12864754", "11807151", "12487508", "11718585", "11728541", "11554951", "11554952", "11440281", "11440288", "11086366", "10993991", "11075838", "9793711", "9482363", "9071263", "3282670"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

The MIDAS score has been shown to have moderately high test-retest reliability in headache sufferers and is correlated with clinical judgment regarding the need for medical care. The aim of the study was to examine the validity of the MIDAS score, and the five items comprising the score, compared to data from a 90 day daily diary used, in part, to record acute disability from headache. In a population-based sample, 144 clinically diagnosed migraine headache sufferers were enrolled in a 90 day diary study and completed the MIDAS questionnaire at the end of the study. The daily diary was used to record detailed information on headache features as well as activity limitations in work, household chores, and non-work activities (social, family and leisure activities). The MIDAS score was the sum of missed work or school days, missed household chores days, missed non-work activity days, and days at work or school plus days of household chores where productivity was reduced by half or more in the last 3 months. Validity was assessed by comparing MIDAS items and the MIDAS score with equivalent measures derived from the diary. The MIDAS items for missed days of work or school (mean 0.96, median 0) and for missed days of household work (mean 3.64, median 2.0) were similar to the corresponding diary-based estimates of missed work or school (mean 1.23, median 0) and of missed household work (mean 3.93, median 2.01). Values for missed days of non-work activities (MIDAS mean 2.6 and median 1 versus diary mean 2.22 and median 0.95) were also similar. Responses to MIDAS questions about number of days where productivity was reduced by half or more in work (mean 3.77, median 2.00) and in household work (mean 3.92, median 2.00) significantly overestimated the corresponding diary-based measures for work (mean 2.94, median 1.06) and household work (mean 2.22, median 0.98). Nonetheless, the overall MIDAS score (mean 14.53, median 9.0) was not significantly different form the reference diary-based measure (mean 13.5, median 8.4). The correlation between the MIDAS summary score and an equivalent diary score was 0.63. The group estimate of the MIDAS score was found to be a valid estimate of a rigorous diary-based measure of disability. The mean and median values for the MIDAS score in a population-based sample of migraine cases were similar to equivalent diary measures. The correlation between the two measures was in the low moderate range, but expected given that two very different methods of data collection were compared.", "outbound_citations": ["11703471", "10534586", "10496257", "10214536", "10068175", "9928781", "9601624", "9459068", "9523051", "9060010", "8951918", "8895229", "8710124", "8792034", "7969941", "7838588", "8008223", "8008224", "8008228", "1484718", "1447585", "1765037", "2520397", "3282670", "3760843", "3489218", "3982842", "6226918", "7122113"], "inbound_citations": ["37221478", "37170218", "37140215", "37016181", "36797058", "36810472", "36748728", "36739512", "36766576", "36701797", "36710692", "36688271", "36636140", "36396451", "36611297", "36510284", "36321956", "36356992", "36395587", "36513096", "36292007", "36115947", "36097203", "35965182", "35817570", "35815637", "35889884", "35650419", "35750456", "35546653", "35514209", "35510376", "35593782", "35382764", "35366822", "35361224", "35352312", "35343590", "35331152", "35301884", "35303287", "35302383", "35264083", "35243611", "35207390", "35146696", "35307672", "34976097", "34921650", "35295528", "34732803", "34706630", "34572118", "34388298", "34380431", "34294026", "34273952", "34151875", "34081791", "34036572", "34133367", "33980206", "33971819", "33931113", "33543444", "33491167", "33691037", "33472427", "33432362", "33432581", "33485090", "33549045", "33326608", "33391147", "33135784", "33003110", "32920850", "32948327", "32819150", "32799346", "32749685", "32671582", "32652924", "32423454", "32358380", "32376640", "32222952", "32164428", "32093628", "32031072", "32019484", "32051295", "31919565", "32982095", "31677218", "31764666", "31757169", "31688600", "31568311", "31557329", "31500616", "31433669", "31410844", "30690591", "31370786", "31234894", "31191737", "30784040", "34007541", "31888723", "31146320", "30918603", "34007536", "30659602", "34007525", "31316732", "30774417", "31553391", "31113373", "30481348", "30478067", "30367817", "30332996", "30425565", "30035299", "29870397", "29924411", "29904852", "29661162", "29571276", "29523138", "29489688", "29445880", "29396646", "29131328", "29271796", "28920448", "28731960", "29413360", "28984356", "31556274", "28160397", "28583453", "28524254", "28800342", "28726049", "29464670", "28542287", "28209308", "28139000", "27153358", "28514332", "27141872", "27933580", "27731896", "27160948", "27766076", "27114878", "27114657", "26922333", "26733600", "26810487"], "label": "1"}

Recurrent headaches can be a significant source of stress for patient and parents, and disruptive regarding school obligations and parental work responsibilities. Most treatment interventions are developed from research data extrapolated from adult studies, with resultant concerns of safety and efficacy when utilizing these therapeutic conclusions in children.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis paper incorporates current treatment strategies in paediatric migraine utilizing a Medline search of English language studies from January 1988 to December 1999, with a literature search referencing the terms of paediatrics, migraines, headaches, therapy and treatment. Reference sections of the articles were reviewed for pertinent information prior to January 1988. Articles were evaluated systematically to formulate concise terms for diagnosis of paediatric migraine and applicability to clinical treatment studies. Particular emphasis was placed on newer options with relevance in adult treatment such as triptans and anti-epileptic drugs, and their benefit in therapy of paediatric migraine. Non-pharmacological options were also subjected to organized review to determine relevance in treatment of paediatric migraine.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe review of the literature indicates that although migraine in childhood and adolescence appears to be increasing in prevalence, few clinical studies are available, with most current treatment recommendations utilizing data from adult studies.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFurther headache treatment studies in the paediatric population are necessary in order to ascertain safety and efficacy of pharmaco-therapeutics in these children. Also, much current interest in treatment in adults with recurrent headaches involves non-pharmacological areas-dietary modification and stress management. Application of these avenues especially warrants further clarification with regard to relevance in paediatric migraine treatment.", "outbound_citations": ["11167908", "10720311", "10534253", "10499171", "10499172", "9793697", "9733291", "9633718", "9596000", "9065533", "9504999", "9109909", "9137847", "9008503", "8857719", "8648543", "7533143", "7950559", "8255443", "8376100", "8502382", "1545424", "1727198", "1860787", "2036663", "2248515", "2406809", "3048700", "3332867", "3038036", "3822681", "6890153", "6126280", "7216070", "324951", "403104", "859128", "977327", "13924172", "20771881", "21372939"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

Short-term studies have demonstrated that almotriptan provides rapid, effective and reliable relief of migraine attacks, while offering excellent tolerability. Purpose: To assess the long-term tolerability and efficacy of oral almotriptan 12.5 mg administered for every migraine attack over a 1-year period. Methods: A total of 762 patients treated 13,751 attacks (1\u201397 per patient); 61.5% of attacks were treated with one 12.5-mg dose, while for 38.5% of attacks, patients took a second dose within 24 h. Results: Three hundred and ninety-one patients (51.3%) experienced a total of 1,617 adverse events (AEs). The majority (88.6%) of AEs were of mild-to-moderate intensity, and only 28.8% of AEs were considered to be related to the study drug. Only 2 patients experienced serious AEs possibly related to almotriptan, syncope and chest pain; both recovered without any sequelae. Patients reported at least 1 AE in 11% of attacks treated. The incidence of AEs decreased during the study. Only 6 (0.8%) study withdrawals were due to AEs considered to be related to almotriptan. Tolerability was not compromised in patients taking 2 doses of almotriptan or in those using migraine prophylactics. Patient age or sex did not influence the incidence of AEs. There was no evidence of tachyphylaxis in those patients completing the study. Pain relief at 2 h after the initial dose was achieved in 84.2% of moderate/severe attacks. Patients were pain free at 2 h after dose in 58.2% of all attacks. Older patients (>40 years) tended to respond better than younger ones (<40 years). Efficacy was not modified by use of migraine prophylactics or hormonal contraceptives. Efficacy measurements were consistent on treating repeated moderate/severe migraine attacks. Conclusion: This large, open study indicates that the new, specific 5-HT1B/1D agonist almotriptan, at a dose of 12.5 mg, is a well tolerated and effective treatment for migraine pain when used over a period of up to 1 year.", "outbound_citations": ["11075844", "9827245", "9748025", "9629840", "9617601", "9523053", "9439085", "9399016", "9058393", "9371897", "8008222", "8394239", "1603351", "1379152", "1727198", "1329294", "1665260", "3048700"], "inbound_citations": ["33208542", "32093628", "31433669", "30845850", "23570251", "22762358", "20945537", "20187858"], "label": "1"}

Total costs in each treatment group were calculated and applied independently to 11 clinical trial efficacy measures. Three of the efficacy measures showed no statistically significant difference between treatment arms, leading to a decision to use the less expensive DHE. In 4 of the efficacy measures. DHE was the obvious choice because it is more efficacious and less expensive. For the final 4 efficacy measures, where sumatriptan is more efficacious and more expensive, incremental cost-efficacy ratios were calculated to determine the additional expenditure required to achieve outcomes associated with quick relief. Depending on the efficacy variable chosen and the assumptions used in the model, the incremental cost-efficacy ratios ranged from $US4000 to $US6700 per year (1993 dollars) for each additional patient who is successfully treated with sumatriptan compared with DHE. Therefore, in a population of 100 migraineurs, an additional 13 to 22 patients would achieve these short term benefits of sumatriptan, although it would cost an additional $US88 395 annually, given the assumptions made.

The lower number of subjects in the alniditan 1.8 mg group is due to the termination of this trial arm after the incidence of a serious adverse event and a subsequent protocol amendment. The number of subjects who were pain free at 2 h (primary endpoint) was: 22 (14.1%) with placebo, 174 (56.3%) with alniditan 1.4 mg, 87 (61.7%) with alnditan 1.8 mg and 209 (65.9%) with sumatriptan 6 mg. Alniditan 1.4 mg was significantly better (P < 0.001) than placebo and sumatriptan was significantly better (P = 0.015) than alniditan 1.4 mg.

The objective of this open-label, cross-over study was to explore patients' preferences for sumatriptan 50 mg vs. zolmitriptan 2.5 mg tablets, focusing on factors influencing this preference. One hundred consecutive migraine patients attending our clinics were asked to treat three attacks with each medication and then fill out a preference questionnaire. Ninety-four migraineurs completed the trial and 42 (44%, 95% CI 34\u201358%) reported that they preferred zolmitriptan 2.5 mg over sumatriptan 50 mg tablets and 27 (29%, 20\u201338%) preferred sumatriptan 50 mg. The remaining 25 (27%, 18\u201336%) did not show any preference. For the initial treatment of the attacks, there were more patients needing just one tablet of zolmitriptan 2.5 mg compared with sumatriptan 50 mg (67 vs. 39%). The reasons for preference among those 69 patients who had shown preference for either of the two triptans were: a faster onset of action (speed of onset) (73%), a longer duration of the effects (39%), fewer adverse events (35%) and lower price (13%). Only one-quarter of the studied migraine population thought that sumatriptan 50 mg and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg were equivalent, which suggests that most migraine patients differentiate between triptans.

We used aggregated data for ergotamine drugs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSumatriptan constituted 46% of the total amount of defined daily doses (DDD) sold and 94% of the total pharmacy retail price expenses in the drug-group studied. In total, 43389 users of sumatriptan were identified who presented 340148 prescriptions, corresponding to 2.2 million DDD of sumatriptan. The quarterly consumption increased by 50% during the study period. Tablets accounted for 92% of consumption. The 1 year period prevalence of use of sumatriptan among persons 16 years and older was 7.8 per 1000 in 1995 with a female to male prevalence ratio of 3.8:1. Use was most common in the age interval 35-54 years. Regional differences in use, which were not large, were positively correlated to the degree of urbanization. The incidence of use of sumatriptan was estimated at 3.6 per 1000 person-years. The intensity of use of sumatriptan varied greatly with 1.1% of patients (n = 507) using 60 DDD or more within 30 days at some time during the observation period. Long-term high use of tablets was common in this group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe conclude that sumatriptan had a considerable impact on the treatment of migraine with prescription drugs in Denmark.

Within 2 hours, headache severity decreased to none/mild in 86% of all attacks in the sumatriptan group (STG) compared to 25% in the customary group (CTG). Migraine was alleviated earlier in the STG than in the CTG (median 3.78 vs. 13.39 hours, p < 0.0001). The direct and total cost of treatment was 133 and 2012 BF, respectively, in the CTG and 1400 and 2522 BF, respectively, in the STG. Measuring the effectiveness of earlier pain relief with sumatriptan, the incremental cost-effective ratios for direct and total cost were 132 and 53 BF per hour of relieved pain, respectively. For this price, significantly more sumatriptan patients improved their quality of life by more than 20% (61.6 vs. 20.6% patients, p < 0.001) and less sumatriptan patient consulted a medical professional (11.3 vs. 29.2% patients, p < 0.01), used less medication for adverse events (6.2 vs. 22.5%, p < 0.001) and suffered less from associated migraine symptoms. The median number of hours of diminished work-efficiency (3 vs. 7 hours, p < 0.01) or of suspension of non-professional activity (10 vs. 24 hours, p < 0.001) was also significantly lower in the STG. The total cost per successfully treated patient was lower in the STG.

Adult patients presenting to the ED from September 1992 through April 1993 with a diagnosis of migraine as determined by International Headache Society criteria. Patients were randomized to receive 6 mg sumatriptan SC or placebo. Patients were monitored for improvement in headache severity using a four-point scale and for time to meaningful relief using a stopwatch. The time to discharge from the ED was recorded. An open-label 100 mg sumatriptan PO tablet was given to all patients on discharge from the ED for use at home if the headache recurred within 24 hours. One hundred thirty-six patients were enrolled. Seventy-five percent of patients treated with sumatriptan achieved meaningful relief compared with 35% treated with placebo (P < .001). The median time to meaningful relief was 34 minutes in the group that received sumatriptan. Seventy percent of patients in the sumatriptan group versus 35% in the placebo group reported mild or no pain at discharge (P < .001). Migraine-associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were significantly reduced in the sumatriptan group (P < .005).

They are usually the drugs of choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different triptans are available in various strengths and formulations, including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections. In Europe, sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences among the triptans exist, as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including half-life, time to peak plasma concentrations, peak plasma concentrations, area under the concentration-time curve, metabolism and drug-drug interaction profiles. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and tolerability advantages for one agent over another is not well differentiated. However, delivery systems may play an important role in onset of action. Given that the clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle, identification of the most appropriate triptan for an individual patient requires consideration of the specific characteristics of the patient and knowledge of patient preference, an accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute-care medications and individual features of the drug being considered. The selection of an acute antimigraine drug also depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases and concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. Individual patient response to the triptans seems to be idiosyncratic and possibly genetically determined. Therefore, a set of specific questions can be used to determine whether a currently used triptan is optimally effective, whether the dose needs to be increased or whether another triptan should be tried. The clinician has in his/her armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of triptans, available in multiple formulations and dosages, which have good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to optimise therapeutic benefit. Use of the methods outlined in this review in choosing a triptan for an individual patient is probably more likely to lead to migraine relief than making an educated guess as to which triptan is most appropriate.", "outbound_citations": ["7964913", "12864757", "12391349", "11972576", "11993610", "11824821", "11860644", "11673575", "11576198", "11559322", "11678811", "11385257", "11264695", "11209164", "11078003", "10980753", "11014417", "10817444", "10636142", "11089515", "10611145", "10529545", "10524661", "10640258", "11284462", "9827244", "9595867", "9536565", "9409334", "9371896", "9439085", "9371898", "9209775", "8710123", "7644082", "7828190", "8381056", "1647495", "1851894", "1653135", "2544280", "2545459", "11152011", "9563207", "1653141", "9399016", "9371897", "1653137", "3048700"], "inbound_citations": ["36879707", "34849034", "32739524", "32223301", "31563229", "30033394", "25249023", "23483096", "22762358", "20687618", "22072055", "21125432", "20352584", "20352590"], "label": "0"}

The objective of the Migraine and Zomig Evaluation study was to provide insights into the management of migraine in the general population. In phase I, 5553 members of the general public in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and the US were interviewed by telephone and classified according to International Headache Society criteria. The Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire was used to assess the impact of migraine on work, home and social lives. In phase II, 516 patients with clinically diagnosed migraine were interviewed to assess the impact of migraine on daily life, attitudes towards migraine, perceptions of current treatments and aspirations for future treatments. In phase I, the average prevalence of migraine over the five countries was 9%. Migraine posed a significant burden in terms of the impact on patients' daily lives, and attack severity and frequency. However, medical consultation rates were low; reasons for this included patients not recognising that they had migraine or having low expectations about treatment benefits. On average, only 10% of patients who had consulted a physician had been prescribed a triptan. Only 22% of participants in phase II thought that migraine did not markedly affect their lives. In each of the five countries, > or = 50% of patients required bed rest to manage migraine attacks, demonstrating the impact of migraine-related disability on patients' lives. Assessment of MIDAS scores confirmed the debilitating effect of migraine; > 50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or IV, indicating moderate or severe disability. Less than one-third of patients reported that their current medication was consistently effective and only 36% were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy. High efficacy and rapid pain relief were rated as the most important attributes of migraine medications. When asked which formulation they would like to see more of, most patients chose a tablet that dissolves in the mouth without the need to take liquids. These results show that migraine patients worldwide are still not receiving adequate treatment and there remains a significant unmet need in migraine care. The challenge for the future is to diagnose migraine early and offer patients effective migraine-specific therapies. Physicians particularly need to reach patients who do not realise they have migraine and those who have lapsed from care.", "outbound_citations": ["11252154", "11086366", "10980724", "10980723", "10214536", "10640257", "9529763", "9371896", "9399015", "7553806", "7758098", "7843949", "8436495", "1384985", "1525798", "1393842", "1599358", "1727198", "11152011", "9371897", "10179702", "3048700"], "inbound_citations": ["34962305", "33814063", "33810839", "32819957", "32073660", "31302899", "30947702", "29791944", "25483402", "20819843", "20713557"], "label": "0"}

We hypothesized that sumatriptan, a 5-HT(1D) agonist, would diminish 5-HT release, thereby worsening OCD symptoms. We further hypothesized that by beginning to desensitize 5-HT(1D) receptors, sumatriptan pretreatment would promote a faster response or an increased likelihood of response to subsequent treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe five sumatriptan subjects' OCD symptom worsening, as measured by the Yale-Brown scale ( upward arrow 17.6% (S.D. 14.6)), was significant when compared to the slight symptom decrease in the five placebo subjects ( downward arrow 5.2% (S.D. 4.9), P<0.015). The sumatriptan group did not exhibit a faster response or greater likelihood of response to a 90-day, open label trial of paroxetine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLonger term studies of the effects of 5-HT(1D) agonists on OCD symptoms are indicated.

The headache relief rates were combined from the placebo arms of these randomised clinical trials assessing the value of sumatriptan in acute treatment of migraine. The main outcome measure was the proportion of patients reclassified from severe or moderate headache severity to no or mild headache severity 2 h after the beginning of treatment. In the oral regimen 222 of 865 patients (25.7%) reported no or mild headache severity after 2 h, compared to 279 of 862 patients (32.4%) of those receiving subcutaneous placebo (6.7% difference; 95% CI 2.4-11.0%). Adjusting for treatment setting and severity of headache at baseline did not change the observed difference. After placebo treatment at home 285 of 1,054 patients (27.0%) reported no or mild headache severity after 2 h, compared to 216 of 673 patients (32.1%) among those receiving placebo in hospital (5.1 % difference; 95% CI 0.6-9.5%). When adjusted for route of administration and severity of headache at baseline, the difference in relief rates between home and hospital setting disappeared.

Scrutiny of these agents in an effort to detect any signal of teratogenicity is thus important. A systematic review of the medical literature was conducted to identify information regarding the safety of sumatriptan during pregnancy. This agent was chosen to be investigated because it has been available for the longest and is the most widely used of the triptan class. Information was obtained regarding the impact of migraine on pregnancy outcome, and data on sumatriptan use in pregnancy were obtained from animal studies, preclinical drug trials, postmarketing surveillance efforts, prospective pregnancy registries, national birth registries and teratogen information services. Synthesis of information from these sources is sufficient to rule out a large increase in birth defects from sumatriptan use during pregnancy and is reassuring for cases where inadvertent exposure to sumatriptan during pregnancy has occurred. However, current information is not sufficient to rule out small increases in the risk for birth defects.

The major pharmacological difference between mCPP and MK-212 is their affinity for the 5-HT(ID) receptor. The aim of this study was to explore the role of the 5-HT(ID) receptor in the pathophysiology of OCD, by using a challenge paradigm with the selective 5-HT(ID) receptor agonist sumatriptan (Imigran). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover challenge with sumatriptan (100 mg PO) was performed in 15 OCD patients. Neither the obsessive compulsive symptoms nor mood or anxiety symptoms changed significantly following sumatriptan administration as compared to placebo. Sumatriptan did induce a significant increase in plasma growth hormone (GH) levels. In the present study, no indication were found for the role of the 5-HT(ID) receptor in the pathophysiology of OCD. It should be noted, however, that sumatriptan does not readily pass the blood-brain barrier.

Migraine patients, aged 18 to 71 years, took equivalent oral doses of 12.5 mg almotriptan or 50 mg sumatriptan for the abortive treatment of a migraine headache. Treatment satisfaction differences between study groups were assessed using a 6-item measure to determine patients' satisfaction with pain relief and satisfaction with side effects 48 hours after drug administration. Functional status was assessed by analyzing the change in patients' ability to perform normal activities during the course of the migraine. HRQOL was compared between treatment groups at 24 hours using the Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire. End points were assessed using entries from patients' 48-hour diaries. A total of 1173 patients were treated with almotriptan or sumatriptan. There were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups in terms of satisfaction with pain relief; however, patients in the almotriptan group were significantly more satisfied (less bothered) with side effects than those receiving sumatriptan (P = 0.016). Functional status and HRQOL outcomes were not significantly different between groups. In this study, migraine patients treated with almotriptan were significantly more satisfied with the side-effect profile of the drug than patients treated with sumatriptan.

The 5HT1 agonist sumatriptan reduces fasting fundic tone, prolongs the meal-induced fundic relaxation, and delays gastric emptying. We therefore hypothesized that sumatriptan might have a significant effect on the rate of postprandial transient LES relaxations and gastroesophageal reflux. We aimed to study the effect of sumatriptan on postprandial transient LES relaxations and reflux in healthy subjects.Methods:Esophageal manometry and pH monitoring were performed in 13 healthy volunteers for 30 min before and 90 min after a semiliquid meal (790 kcal). Sumatriptan 6 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) or s.c. placebo were administered on separate days 30 min after the meal.Results:Sumatriptan significantly increased postprandial LES pressure from 11.0 \u00b1 1.2 mm Hg to 17.6 \u00b1 1.2 mm Hg (p < 0.05). However, reflux events were not diminished. In the contrary, reflux was more frequent after sumatriptan than after placebo (3 [1.5\u20134.5;[sol;30 min vs 2 [0\u20133;[sol;30 min, p < 0.05). Transient LES relaxations were more frequent after sumatriptan, particularly in the second 30-min period after drug administration (3 [2.5\u20135;[sol;30 min vs 2 [1.5\u20132;[sol;30 min, p < 0.05).Conclusions:Sumatriptan prevents the natural decay in rate of transient LES relaxations that occurs after a meal and favors the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux despite increasing LES pressure. The sustained postprandial high rate of transient LES relaxations after sumatriptan may be a consequence of a prolonged fundus relaxation and retention of meal in the proximal stomach.", "outbound_citations": ["9536951", "9142924", "9225278", "9070474", "8784797", "7557138", "7615211", "7840195", "7806066", "7934431", "8235440", "1336675", "1379152", "2166920", "3396810", "3410327", "3578522", "2888879", "4029557", "3995239", "7144836", "7450419", "7356677", "14132337"], "inbound_citations": ["35268781", "31121087"], "label": "0"}

However, given the relatively low spatial resolution of PET, regional indices of neural activity can be influenced by signals from nonneural elements in the intracranial space. We have used PET to study the functional neuroanatomy of headache syndromes, such as cluster headache and experimental headache, by observing activation in brain that is due to synaptic activity. In these studies we noted a bilateral activation in midline structures over several planes that, based on its anatomy, is likely to arise from bilateral large intracranial arteries in the region of the cavernous sinus. We have observed this activity in two different group studies and in 11 of 17 single-subject studies. The most likely explanation for this \"activation\" is the increased volume of space occupied by dilated large vessels containing H215O. We further defined the anatomy of the PET findings using magnetic resonance angiography, which showed bilateral vasodilatation of the internal carotid artery and the basilar artery in nitroglycerin-induced cluster headache attacks. While the fact that vascular structures can contaminate PET-based blood flow studies may be well known to methodological experts, the issue is less well recognized outside the immediate field.", "outbound_citations": ["9690407", "9514561", "9203569", "8792033", "8634619", "7585147", "9343597", "7931375", "7912763", "8027764", "7518321", "8014115", "8200785", "7835381", "8306085", "8349470", "1653134", "2036298", "2113834", "2786929", "3282670", "3489506", "3485282", "6139150", "4971733"], "inbound_citations": ["32413700", "31563225", "28948863", "25657327", "20670995", "21384294", "20376601"], "label": "0"}

Bioavailability is high (96%) following subcutaneous injection, but low (14%) following oral administration because of first-pass metabolism. Absorption is rapid after subcutaneous injection, with peak concentration reached in 10 minutes. After oral administration, multiple peak concentrations are observed, but a concentration that is 75% of the final peak concentration is usually reached within 45 minutes. Less than 20% of the drug is protein bound. The volume of distribution is greater than total body water at 170L. Total plasma clearance is rapid, with an elimination half-life of around 2 hours. There is one major metabolite (an indole acetic acid analogue) which is excreted in the urine as the free acid and its ester glucuronide conjugate. The pharmacokinetic profile of sumatriptan is not significantly affected by an acute migraine attack (absorption phase), old age or gender. Pharmacokinetic studies in individuals with hepatic and renal disease have not been published; however, care should be taken when sumatriptan is administered to patients with liver disease until such information is available.

DESIGN: Retrospective review of a managed care organization's medical and pharmacy claims databases for claims filed between January 1, 1989 and June 30, 1990. PATIENTS: Patients between 18 and 64 years old with a 12-month minimum enrollment in the health plan, including enrollment for the prescription drug benefit. Migraine group (n=1336) inclusion required a medical claim with the diagnosis of migraine headache and a pharmacy claim for a medication potentially used for migraine treatment. Comparison group (n=1336) inclusion required at least one medical claim with no diagnosis of migraine; a pharmacy claim was not required. Comparison group patients were matched to migraine group patients by age, gender, enrollment status, and subscriber or dependent enrollment status. OUTCOME MEASURES: Total health services use, diagnosis-specific use of services, diagnostic procedures performed, comorbid conditions, medication use, and associated costs were tallied. RESULTS: Migraineurs generated nearly twice as many medical claims as comparison group patients, and nearly 2.5 times as many pharmacy claims. Number of claims generated and numbers of patients who generated claims within each of 19 diagnostic categories indicated greater comorbidity in the migraine group. Migraineurs used emergency services more than did patients in the comparison group. Total medical and pharmacy claims costs were $3.4 million for the migraine group and $2.1 million for the comparison group. The average amount paid per member-month of enrollment was significantly greater in the migraine group than in the comparison group. Comorbid conditions were responsible for a significant portion of costs in the migraine group.

The exact pathophysiological disturbances that occur with migraine have yet to be elucidated; however, cervico-trigemino-vascular dysfunctions appear to be the primary cause. Despite advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine and new effective treatment options, migraine remains an under-diagnosed, under-treated and poorly treated health condition. Most patients will unsuccessfully attempt to treat their headaches with over-the-counter medications. Few well designed, placebo-controlled studies are available to guide physicians in medication selection. Recently published evidence-based guidelines advocate migraine-specific drugs, such as serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists (the 'triptans') and dihydroergotamine mesylate, for patients experiencing moderate to severe migraine attacks. Additional headache attack therapy options include other ergotamine derivatives, phenothiazines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioids.

(2) In 1996, selegiline, a type B MAOI marketed in France since 1988, saw its indications extended to cover single-agent therapy of early-stage Parkinson's disease, and in combination with levodopa, before onset of complications of levodopa therapy. The initial clinical file failed to show that selegiline had any benefit in these indications. (3) Now, in 2002, new data from trials involving hundreds of untreated patients show that selegiline postpones the need for levodopa therapy for a few months but fails to substantially alter the progression of Parkinson's disease. (4) A clinical trial and a retrospective epidemiological study of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease showed excess mortality on selegiline. (5) The side effects of selegiline are similar to those of other antiparkinsonian drugs and amphetamine. Notable side effects include cardiovascular problems (postural hypotension, atrial fibrillation and arterial hypertension). (6) Selegiline can cause a serotoninergic syndrome and arterial hypertension, so must not be combined with pethidine, tramadol, bupropion, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan or naratriptan. Concurrent treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants should also be avoided. (7) Given the only moderate effects of selegiline in Parkinson's disease, and the possibility of a slight increase in mortality, there is no justification for prescribing this medication in patients with Parkinson's disease. (8) Whatever the stage of Parkinson's disease, there is no justification for starting patients on selegiline. Patients who are already taking selegiline should only continue to take it if they feel a clear benefit and are free from risk factors for early mortality, especially cardiovascular disease.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["24158007"], "label": "0"}

This was an open-label study conducted in 3 family practice settings. Patients were recruited who had at least a 1-year history of migraine meeting International Headache Society criteria and experienced 2 to 6 attacks per month within the previous 3 months.

At follow-up, patients completed a questionnaire assessing satisfaction with access to multiple formulations. Of the 33 enrolled patients (26 women, 7 men; mean age, 38.5 years [range, 23-54 years]), 25 (75.8%) completed all visits. Of 149 headaches treated, 39 (26.2%) were mild at onset, 70 (47.0%) were moderate, and 40 (26.8%) were severe. Eighty (53.7%) headaches were treated with tablets, 35 (23.5%) with nasal spray, and 34 (22.8%) with SC injection. Primary reasons for selecting specific formulations included \"fewer side effects\" for tablets, \"convenience\" for nasal spray, and \"quick onset of action\" for SC injection. Twenty-one (84.0%) patients reported being either very satisfied or satisfied with their ability to manage their headaches. Physicians reported that 18 of 24 (75.0%) patients had an improved attitude toward managing their headaches. All formulations were well tolerated.

Patients treated migraine at the first sign of pain, while pain was mild, but not more than 2 hours after onset with oral sumatriptan, 50 mg or 100 mg, or matching placebo. The primary end point was pain-free relief at 2 hours after treatment with 50 mg of sumatriptan compared with placebo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 354 patients in study 1 and 337 patients in study 2. Significantly more patients treated with sumatriptan, 50 mg and 100 mg, were completely free from pain 2 and 4 hours after treatment vs patients treated with placebo (at 2 hours, 50% and 57% vs 29%; at 4 hours, 61% and 68% vs 30%; for both, P < .001). Also, significantly more patients treated with sumatriptan, 50 mg and 100 mg, were migraine-free (no pain or associated symptoms) vs those treated with placebo at 2 and 4 hours after treatment (at 2 hours, 43% and 49% vs 24%; at 4 hours, 54% and 63% vs 28%; for both, P < .001). The incidence of overall adverse events was low with the 50- and 100-mg dose of sumatriptan (placebo, 7%; sumatriptan at 50 mg, 14%; sumatriptan at 100 mg, 16%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment of migraine at the first sign of pain with sumatriptan, 50-mg and 100-mg tablets, provides superior pain-free relief at 2 and 4 hours after treatment compared with placebo. Results of these studies suggest that sumatriptan at 100 mg may be more efficacious than at 50 mg when used in the early treatment paradigm.

Plasma almotriptan was quantified by h.p.l.c.-MS-MS, while urinary concentrations were measured by h.p.l.c.-u.v. Vital signs, ECGs, and adverse events were evaluated after almotriptan administration. Treatment effects on pharmacokinetics and vital signs were assessed by analysis of variance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean almotriptan AUC was higher (483 +/- 99.9 vs 352 +/- 75.4 ng ml-1 h, P = 0.0001) and oral clearance was lower (26.6 +/- 4.00 vs 36.6 +/- 5.89 l h-1, P = 0.0001) when almotriptan was administered with moclobemide. Mean half-life was longer (4.22 +/- 0.78 vs 3.41 +/- 0.45 h, P = 0.0002) after coadministration with moclobemide. Renal clearance of almotriptan was unaffected by moclobemide. No serious adverse events occurred and no clinically significant vital sign changes were observed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMoclobemide increased plasma concentrations of almotriptan on average by 37%, but the combined administration of these two compounds was well tolerated.

Extended-release venlafaxine has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Mirtazapine, which is unrelated to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is unique in its action--stimulating the release of norepinephrine and serotonin. The choice of antidepressant drug depends on the agent's pharmacologic profile, secondary actions, and tolerability. Sexual dysfunction related to the use of antidepressants may be addressed by reducing the dosage, switching to another agent, or adding another drug to overcome the sexual side effects. Augmentation with lithium or triiodothyronine may be useful in patients who are partially or totally resistant to antidepressant treatment.

Sumatriptan is a selective 5-HT(1B/D) receptor agonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of sumatriptan on exercise capacity. Ten healthy male subjects (mean age 28.4+/-10.8 years) performed a maximal treadmill exercise test according to the Bruce protocol with expired gas analysis on two occasions. Either 6 mg of sumatriptan or placebo was administered subcutaneously in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Exercise time was greater after placebo compared with sumatriptan [914 and 879 s respectively; 95% confidence interval (CI) of difference 12.1 s, 59.1 s; P = 0.008]. There was no significant effect on peak oxygen consumption (placebo, 50.6+/-6.3 ml.min(-1).kg(-1); sumatriptan, 51.7+/-7.6 ml.min(-1).kg(-1)). Sumatriptan administration resulted in decreases in both heart rate (sumatriptan, 188+/-14 beats/min, placebo, 196+/-12 beats/min; 95% CI of difference 12.6, 2.6; P = 0.008) and respiratory exchange ratio (sumatriptan, 1.23+/-0.06; placebo, 1.26+/-0.07; 95% CI of difference 0.05, 0.01; P = 0.01) at peak exercise. There were no significant differences in blood pressure, heart rate or submaximal oxygen consumption between sumatriptan and placebo treatments at any stage of exercise.

Cluster headache exhibits diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity. While cluster headache has traditionally been thought of as a vascular headache disorder, its periodicity suggests involvement of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, the biological clock. Normal circadian function and seasonal changes occurring in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and pineal gland are correlated to the clinical features and abnormalities of circadian rhythm seen in cluster headache. Abnormalities in the secretion of melatonin and cortisol in patients with cluster headache, neuroimaging of cluster headache attacks, and the use of melatonin as preventative therapy in cluster headache are discussed in this review. While the majority of studies exploring the relationship between circadian rhythms and cluster headache are not new, we have entered a new diagnostic and therapeutic era in primary headache disorders. The time has come to use the evidence for a disorder of circadian rhythm in cluster headache to further development of chronobiotics in the treatment of this disorder.", "outbound_citations": ["11293599", "11087776", "11167909", "10433864", "10395332", "10395311", "10366002", "10215906", "10810544", "9690407", "9595871", "9556099", "9415954", "9382465", "9321846", "8988899", "8880732", "8933994", "8596937", "7481759", "7585147", "7553813", "7828195", "7518321", "8209245", "8242722", "8506022", "1480746", "1480750", "1665104", "2280901", "2406223", "3282670", "3048700", "3442810", "3572435", "3840235", "6518501", "6713522", "6536887", "6823571", "6850818", "7347624", "1254468", "1175007", "4808324", "5047187", "5002428", "4314825", "5478537", "13364081"], "inbound_citations": ["36543572", "35399109", "35315064", "33472428", "32352572", "31466456", "31370669", "31129808", "30618656", "30019090", "29635936", "29493566", "27605571", "27530226", "28717529", "28616776", "25896484", "26228801", "25951784", "24899000", "24477598", "23687279", "23574884", "23099125", "22665916", "21876200", "20737158", "20679639"], "label": "0"}

A nasal spray formulation has now been developed. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of fixed doses of zolmitriptan administered via a nasal spray with placebo and zolmitriptan oral tablet in the acute treatment of migraine. This was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, dose-ranging study. 1547 patients aged 18-65 years with an established diagnosis of migraine with or without aura (as defined by International Headache Society criteria) who had at least a 1-year history of migraine and an age of onset <50 years were included. Patients were able to distinguish typical migraine from nonmigraine headaches and had experienced an average of one to six migraine headaches per month during the 2 months preceding the study. Patients were randomised to zolmitriptan (Zomig) The use of tradenames is for product identification purposes only and does not imply endorsement.) nasal spray (5.0, 2.5, 1.0 or 0.5 mg), zolmitriptan oral tablet (2.5mg) or placebo for the treatment of three moderate or severe migraine attacks. The primary outcome measure was headache response at 2 hours following treatment, defined as reduced intensity of migraine pain (using a scale of none, mild, moderate or severe) from severe or moderate at baseline to mild or no pain at 2 hours after treatment. Secondary outcome measures included early headache response at 15, 30 and 45 minutes and headache response at 1 and 4 hours postdose, as well as pain-free rates at 15, 30 and 45 minutes and 1, 2 and 4 hours postdose. Laboratory assessments, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs and nose and throat examinations were performed at screening and follow-up visits. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study using Coding Symbols for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms (COSTART) terminology. Each dose of zolmitriptan nasal spray produced a greater 2-hour headache response rate than placebo (70.3%, 58.6%, 54.8% and 41.5% for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5.0, 2.5, 1.0 and 0.5mg, compared with 30.6% for placebo [all p < 0.001 vs placebo]). The 2-hour headache response rate for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5.0mg was significantly higher than that of the zolmitriptan 2.5mg oral tablet (61.3%; p < 0.05), while comparisons of nasal spray 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5mg with zolmitriptan 2.5mg oral tablet were not statistically significant. The nasal spray 5.0 and 2.5mg showed a rapid onset of action, with a significant difference in headache response compared with placebo from 15 minutes through 4 hours after administration and a significant difference between the nasal spray 5.0mg and 2.5mg oral tablet from 15 minutes through to 2 hours (the other nasal spray doses were not statistically significant compared with 2.5mg oral tablet). Zolmitriptan nasal spray resulted in pain-free rates that were dose dependent. While all doses from 1.0 mg upwards produced significant pain-free outcomes from 30 minutes versus placebo, only the 5.0mg dose produced pain-free rates significantly superior to both placebo and the 2.5mg oral tablet. Zolmitriptan nasal spray was well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being unusual taste and paresthesia. The majority of adverse events were of short duration and mild or moderate intensity. Only ten patients were withdrawn from the trial because of adverse events. Serious adverse events were reported by nine patients after taking study medication, but none was considered to be causally related to study medication. Zolmitriptan was not associated with any clinically significant changes in laboratory test values or vital signs. All doses of zolmitriptan nasal spray produced significant 2-hour headache response rates compared with placebo. The 5.0 and 2.5mg doses were also significantly more effective than placebo for the majority of secondary efficacy measures. Zolmitriptan nasal spray 5.0mg provided a headache response statistically superior to both placebo and the 2.5mg tablet as early as 15 minutes after administration, while demonstrating pain-free outcomes significantly superior to placebo and the 2.5mg tablet as early as 30 minutes after administration.

(3 mg), subcutaneous (s.c.) (6 mg), and oral (25 mg) doses. Volunteers received each dose in a randomized sequence separated by a 7\u2010day washout. Blood and urine samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were taken for up to 24 hours after dosing. The disposition kinetics of almotriptan after i.v. and s.c. administration showed biphasic decline described by a two\u2010compartment model. The fastest disposition phase was well observed, although estimates of the rate constant showed high variability. After s.c. administration of almotriptan, the bioavailability was 100% with a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of 5 to 15 minutes, whereas after oral administration, the bioavailability was about 70% with a tmax of 1.5 to 3.0 hours. No significant differences were observed between administration routes in the elimination half\u2010life (t1/2), obtaining mean values ranging from 3.4 to 3.6 hours. The volume of distribution, total clearance, and t1/2 indicated that almotriptan was extensively distributed and rapidly cleared from the body irrespective of dose or route of administration.

Its efficacy and tolerability have been assessed in a number of randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in large numbers of adults with moderate to severe migraine attacks. Oral zolmitriptan 2.5 and 5mg has a rapid onset of action (significant headache relief is observed at 45 minutes) and efficacy is sustained in most patients who respond at 2 hours. The drug is significantly more effective than placebo as measured by a number of parameters including 2-hour headache response rates and pain-free response rates. Other symptoms of migraine, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia are also alleviated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is effective in the treatment of migraine associated with menses and migraine with aura. There is some evidence to support the use of zolmitriptan in patients with migraine who have had a poor response to previous therapy. The efficacy of zolmitriptan appears to be maintained, with no tachyphylaxis, following repeated administration for multiple attacks of migraine over a prolonged period of time, with high headache response rates reported over all attacks. In comparison with placebo, the incidence of persistent migraine headache is reduced by zolmitriptan and recurrent migraine headache occurs less frequently with the active treatment. Zolmitriptan has also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of persistent and/or recurrent migraine headache. For relief of migraine headache, zolmitriptan 5mg had similar efficacy to sumatriptan 100mg for a single attack, but generally was more effective than sumatriptan 25 and 50mg for multiple attacks, in single trials. The incidence of recurrent headache with zolmitriptan was similar to that with sumatriptan. Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated with most adverse events being mild to moderate, transient and resolving without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The most common adverse events with zolmitriptan therapy are asthenia, heaviness other than that of the chest or neck, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, paraesthesia, warm sensation, tightness, vasodilation and chest pain. Zolmitriptan is effective across a wide range of migraine subtypes, maintains efficacy when used in the long term and is generally well tolerated. Further clinical experience is necessary to define the position of zolmitriptan among other currently or soon to be available selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists. However, on the basis of available data, zolmitriptan should emerge as a useful treatment option in the management of patients with moderate to severe migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["10802793", "10759911", "10214535", "9950449", "10640259", "9888613", "10210888", "9833595", "9793699", "9725543", "9725544", "9665056", "9617601", "9660035", "9542478", "18370509", "9088582", "9431839", "9453273", "9371896", "9401835", "9399016", "9399013", "9399012", "9350383", "9399015", "9399014", "9205817", "9154322", "9170337", "9071266", "9071263", "9476036", "8912486", "8951929", "8792040", "8792029", "8634619", "8733984", "8614525", "8838441", "8825693", "8791030", "7672955", "7697699", "7516861", "10155264", "7928323", "8389011", "8502385", "8502382", "1329294", "2036663", "1699472", "3048700", "9563207", "9371897", "9546526"], "inbound_citations": ["35837681", "35122739", "34834242", "34404806", "32747623", "30806518", "31994510", "26747634"], "label": "0"}

Migraine was diagnosed according to International Headache Society criteria. Headache severity, associated migraine symptoms and functional disability were measured immediately before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 h. Headache recurrence (return of moderate or severe headache after an initial response) was also recorded. In addition to conventional pain relief (reduction of moderate or severe headache to mild or none) and pain free measures, the analysis looked at the elimination of associated migraine symptoms and disability in patients who had symptoms or disability at baseline. Maintenance of pain relief or pain-free status over 24 h was also analysed. At 2 h, rizatriptan 10 mg was significantly more effective than placebo for pain relief (71% vs. 38%, P < 0.001), and for elimination of pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia and functional disability.

The 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists, collectively known as triptans, are a major advance in the treatment of migraine. The beneficial effects of the triptans in patients with migraine are related to their multiple mechanisms of action at sites implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. These mechanisms are mediated by 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors and include vasoconstriction of painfully dilated cerebral blood vessels, inhibition of the release of vasoactive neuropeptides by trigeminal nerves, and inhibition of nociceptive neurotransmission. The high affinity of the triptans for 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors and their favorable pharmacologic properties contribute to the beneficial effects of these drugs, including rapid onset of action, effective relief of headache and associated symptoms, and low incidence of adverse effects.", "outbound_citations": ["11405809", "10980753", "10940090", "11075844", "10883409", "10636142", "11041768", "11089515", "10463349", "10668104", "10564729", "10529545", "10551439", "10563228", "10473025", "10563226", "10443565", "10427351", "10410185", "10402569", "10212302", "10214771", "10217543", "10640258", "10494006", "9862247", "9748025", "9665056", "9679775", "9629840", "9617601", "9563208", "9826913", "9949863", "9523053", "9409334", "9448572", "9203569", "9203565", "9127118", "7538702", "1329294", "2252337", "2993964", "6253831"], "inbound_citations": ["36995514", "37042545", "36370318", "36232720", "36114949", "35816257", "35562512", "35593781", "35524406", "35482233", "35393301", "35278853", "35177004", "35104536", "34852366", "34643938", "34243621", "33793965", "33622738", "34484909", "33859262", "33017476", "32990921", "32886179", "32803467", "33008504", "32058712", "31899878", "32042259", "33841534", "33008517", "31924306", "31871835", "31763951", "31610206", "31286549", "30803922", "31151973", "30845850", "30336190", "30194938", "30016663", "29958920", "29532087", "29376196", "28977362", "29116598", "28599085", "28745513", "28283434", "28336160", "28194544", "28076878", "27699640", "27650272", "27587062", "27635228", "27075428", "27582896", "27078039", "26892478", "26231449", "26119828", "26074006", "26209983", "25524408", "25181019", "25324526", "24904224", "24711666", "25211853", "25048388", "24425100", "24330707", "23570251", "23430984", "22462474", "22762358", "22219624", "20687618", "21916785", "21458220", "21533722", "20569223", "21404609", "21161301", "20945537", "20187858"], "label": "0"}

Two new triptans, frovatriptan and eletriptan, and a nasal formulation of zolmitriptan have been recently developed. Eletriptan is effective for acute migraine treatment and may have some pharmacologic and clinical advantages. Frovatriptan has a longer half-life and lower headache recurrence rates compared with other triptans. It may be useful for patients who have prolonged attacks and high headache recurrence rate. Zolmitriptan nasal spray has a rapid onset of action and high efficacy. It should be considered when patients have rapid-onset attacks, especially when associated with severe nausea or vomiting. The butyrophenone neuroleptic droperidol is very effective in aborting acute migraine attacks. Central nervous system side effects are common, however, and the ECG should be monitored. Botulinum toxin type A shows promise as a safe, tolerable and effective drug for migraine prevention, with the unique advantages of almost no systemic adverse events and a long interval between treatments. The anticonvulsant topiramate is effective for migraine prevention. Cognitive side effects are of less concern with the lower doses needed for migraine. The angiotensin converting enzyme receptor blocker candesartan appears to be effective and highly tolerable in the prevention of migraine, but needs to be further evaluated.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nNew drugs expand the spectrum of migraine treatment both for the acute attack and for prevention.", "outbound_citations": ["12552051", "12503978", "12421155", "12412822", "12391349", "12383061", "12383060", "12390644", "12133040", "12028320", "12028324", "12028325", "12028322", "12028321", "12028323", "11993610", "11807151", "11781912", "12463285", "11903534", "11825307", "11678814", "11480267", "11275374", "11141144", "12463280", "11329944", "10636142", "10473025", "10452443", "10079003", "7591740"], "inbound_citations": ["29878343", "24565480", "23656340"], "label": "1"}

Patient dose preferences are clinically relevant (perhaps moreso than traditional efficacy endpoints) and deserve study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA multinational randomized double-blind crossover study was conducted over 18 weeks to assess patient dose preference, efficacy, and tolerability for oral sumatriptan (25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg) in the acute treatment of migraine; 257 patients treated three attacks, using a different dose for each.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 100 mg dose was preferred by 35% of patients, 31% the 50 mg dose, and 25% the 25 mg dose. Efficacy and speed of action were the two main reasons given for preferring the higher doses. Compared with the 25 mg dose, the 100 mg and 50 mg doses were significantly more likely to provide headache relief at 2, 3, and 4 h after dosing and complete headache resolution at 3 and 4 h after dosing (P < 0.027). Recurrence rates were similar for the three doses, ranging from 33% to 38%, though the median time to recurrence increased with dose, from 8.5 to 11.8 h. The 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg doses were all well tolerated, with adverse event incidences of 19%, 21%, and 30%, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients preferred the 50 mg and 100 mg doses of oral sumatriptan to the 25 mg dose, and the higher doses were more effective against migraine; however, the 25 mg and 50 mg doses were better tolerated than the 100 mg dose.

To demonstrate a possible central nervous system (CNS) action of these compounds in man we studied their effect on the intensity dependence of the cortical auditory evoked potentials (IDAPs), thought to be inversely related to central serotonergic transmission. An amplitude/stimulus intensity function (ASF) slope was computed in healthy volunteers and migraine patients between attacks before and 2 h after oral 311C90 (zolmitriptan \u201cZomig\u201d) 10 mg (n=14), 311C90 5 mg (n=7), sumatriptan 100 mg (n=14), dexfenfluramine 15 mg (n=4), lorazepam 1.25 mg (n=4) and placebo (n=14). 311C90 10 mg and, to a lesser degree, 5 mg significantly increased the mean ASF slope (p=0.007 and 0.05 vs placebo). There was a significant positive correlation between plasma levels of 311C90 and ASF slope changes. Sumatriptan and lorazepam had little effect, but dexfenfluramine produced a significant ASF slope decrease. 311C90 is able to modify a CNS activity that is modulated by serotonin, i.e. the IDAP. This effect is probably the consequence of its super or lipophilicity compared to sumatriptan and of activation of prejunctional 5HT1B/1D autoreceptors, which lowers central serotonin release and thus the preactivation level of sensory cortices.", "outbound_citations": ["8898206", "8951929", "8869766", "8628490", "8614525", "8624686", "8666533", "8791027", "24283575", "8062353", "8294198", "8395298", "8383545", "2166920", "2158835", "2475821", "3742222", "7395606", "171700"], "inbound_citations": ["34456730", "30804782", "28179394", "27013238", "28103158", "26747634"], "label": "0"}

First ES1 and ES2 were measured (stimulus intensity 20 mA, stimulus duration 0.2 ms, stimulation frequency 2 Hz, averaging of 10 responses), then the medication was given on a double-blind basis with an autoinjector using either 6 mg sumatriptan or a placebo solution. Thirty minutes after application the measurements were repeated. No significant differences were found in early and late exteroceptive suppression latencies and durations between baseline measurements. Treatment did not affect the latencies of ESI and ES2. While sumatriptan caused a significant increase in ES1 duration (p \u00a3 0.05) both during the migraine interval and during the migraine attack, placebo showed no significant effect on ES1 duration. Treatment with sumatriptan during the migraine attack was accompanied by a significant increase in the duration of ES2 (p \u00a3 0.05), but no significant changes in the durations of the late suppression periods were observed under any other conditions. The results do not support the assumption that under the experimental conditions chosen migraine attacks are accompanied by a paroxysmal change in the brain-stem mechanisms involved in the modulation of the ES parameters.

Patient-reported questionnaires collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months after initiation of sumatriptan therapy. The cost of lost productivity estimated with the HCA and FCA methods. Of the 178 patients who completed the study, 51% were full-time employees, 13% were part-time, 18% were not working and 17% changed work status. Twenty-four percent reported a clerical or administrative position. From the HCA, the estimated total cost of lost productivity for 6 months following the initiation of sumatriptan was $US117905 (1996 values). From the FCA, the six-month estimated total cost of lost productivity ranged from $US28329 to $US117905 (1996 values). This was the first study to retrospectively estimate lost productivity of patients with migraine using the FCA methodology. Our results demonstrate that depending on the assumptions and illustrations employed, the FCA can yield lost productivity estimates that vary greatly as a percentage of the HCA estimate. Prospective investigations are needed to better determine the components and the nature of the lost productivity for chronic episodic diseases such as migraine headache.", "outbound_citations": ["10179702", "10180754", "10172868", "10155303", "10146980", "10168040", "10175982", "11702897", "11303412", "10943230", "10219932", "10219926", "9768536", "9253726", "9113602", "10158268", "8900548", "10154656", "7884777", "9435921", "8008226", "8436495", "10146911", "1631600", "1727198", "1746521", "3405619", "3084931", "14129045", "10168041", "8046705"], "inbound_citations": ["36352296", "32585811", "31500616", "31055044", "30094591", "27848219", "27538393", "27077793", "26285186", "25946581", "24867830", "22731620", "22583452", "21858534", "21481265"], "label": "0"}

This derives from two main research approaches, operational pharmacology, using selective ligands (both agonists and antagonists), and, more recently, molecular biology. Although the scientific community continues to deliberate about the hierarchy of criteria for neurotransmitter receptor characterisation, there seems good agreement between the two approaches regarding 5-HT receptor classification. In addition, the information regarding transduction mechanisms and second messengers is also entirely consistent. Thus, on the basis of these essential criteria for receptor characterisation and classification, there are at least three main groups or classes of 5-HT receptor: 5-HT1, 5-HT2, and 5-HT3. Each group is not only operationally but also structurally distinct, with each receptor group having its own distinct transducing system. The more recently identified 5-HT4 receptor almost undoubtedly represents a fourth 5-HT receptor class on the basis of operational and transductional data, but this will only be definitively shown when the cDNA for the receptor has been cloned and the amino acid sequence of the protein is known. Although those 5-HT receptors that have been fully characterised and classified to date (and, hence, named with confidence) would seem to mediate the majority of the actions of 5-HT throughout the mammalian body, not all receptors for 5-HT are fully encompassed within our scheme of classification. These apparent anomalies must be recognised and need further study. They may or may not represent new groups of 5-HT receptor or subtypes of already known groups of 5-HT receptor. Even though the cDNAs for the 5-ht1E, 5-ht1F, 5-ht5, 5-ht6, and 5-ht7 receptors have been cloned and their amino acid sequence defined, more data are necessary concerning their operational and transductional characteristics before one can be confident of the suitability of their appellations. Therefore, it is important to rationalise in concert all of the available data from studies involving both operational approaches of the classical pharmacological type and those from molecular and cellular biology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "outbound_citations": ["8122318", "8313412", "8226867", "8298808", "8246127", "8258998", "8229003", "8398139", "8220871", "7693489", "8394987",

Sumatriptan was the first of these compounds to be developed, and offered improved efficacy and tolerability over ergot-derived compounds. The development of sumatriptan was quickly followed by a number of 'second generation' triptan compounds, characterised by improved pharmacokinetic properties and/or tolerability profiles. Triptans are believed to effect migraine relief by binding to serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine) receptors in the brain, where they act to induce vasoconstriction of extracerebral blood vessels and also reduce neurogenic inflammation. Although the pharmacological mechanism of the triptans is similar, their pharmacokinetic properties are distinct. For example, bioavailability of oral formulations ranges between 14% (sumatriptan) and 74% (naratriptan), and their elimination half-life ranges from 2 hours (sumatriptan and rizatriptan) to 25 hours (frovatriptan). Clearly, such diverse pharmacokinetic properties will influence the effectiveness of the compounds and favour the prescription of one over another in different patient populations. This article reviews the pharmacological properties of the triptans (time to peak plasma concentration, half-life, bioavailability and receptor binding) and relates these properties to efficacy and time of onset. It also considers the effects of concomitant medication, food, age and disease on the pharmacokinetics of the compounds. In addition, the relative merits, such as headache recurrence, tolerability and route of administration, are discussed. Finally, the performance of the triptans is considered in the context of direct head-to-head comparative trials that have assessed the efficacy profile of the compounds.", "outbound_citations": ["11405809", "11264684", "10980753", "10849042", "11037741", "10824628", "10741638", "10759925", "10759913", "10759909", "10759911", "10817444", "10636142", "10631628", "10611145", "10595285", "10529545", "10524661", "10692718", "10417495", "10453967", "10553725", "10413073", "10410185", "10402569", "10214771", "15613223", "10233200", "10193663", "10099854", "11284462", "9833595", "11284463", "9827245", "9827244", "9793700", "10210876", "9748025", "9725543", "9700983", "9725544", "9595867", "9563208", "9542478", "9475817", "9088582", "9431839", "9409334", "9371896", "9439085", "9371898", "9401835", "9399013", "9399014", "9205817", "9170336", "9153607", "8980858", "8912486", "8951929", "8935482", "8757005", "8866921", "8825693", "8991488", "8749242", "8536293", "7644049", "7650235", "7782482", "7851052", "8170966", "8161354", "7928325", "8390743", "1357313", "1647495", "1659437", "1681162", "1653135", "1665260", "1653138", "3771205", "9601622", "7928323", "7768259", "9371897", "1653137"], "inbound_citations": ["36655303", "36244298", "35655105", "34275352", "33852525", "33583217", "33151131", "32265634", "31500616", "31131746", "30303862", "29869307", "29203152", "26502740", "26659468"], "label": "0"}

Headaches may at times be severe and affect patient compliance with this treatment modality. The 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonist sumatriptan has been reported to be effective for post-ECT headache in several case reports. The aim of the present open-label study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of intranasal sumatriptan for post-ECT headache. Method Patients undergoing ECT who experienced moderate-to-severe post-ECT headache were enrolled in the study. Patients were asked to rate their headache severity and describe headache characteristics using a standard headache diary. Headaches rated as severe or moderate were treated with 20 mg of intranasal sumatriptan. Additional headache ratings were recorded at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2 hours after sumatriptan administration and compared with baseline values. Results Eight female patients (ages 34\u201345 years old) participated in the trial and experienced a total of 13 post-ECT headaches, which were treated with intranasal sumatriptan. Of the headaches treated, six (46.2%) were described as severe and seven (53.8%) were characterized as moderate in severity. Twelve (92.3%) of the treated headaches responded by the 2 hour posttreatment time point and 11 (84.6%) had responded within 1 hour. Comparisons made at the 1- and 2-hour time point revealed a statistically significant improvement from baseline (p = 0.002). Of the 12 headaches that responded, 6 (50%) were reported as no pain and 5 (38.5%) were reported as only mild pain at 1 hour following treatment. At the 2-hour assessment, an additional headache, which had previously not responded, was rated at mild resulting in six (50%) headaches with complete resolution of pain and six (50%) with a decrease in pain symptoms from moderate or severe to mild. Overall, sumatriptan treatment was well tolerated, and no significant adverse effects or changes in vital signs were recorded. In no case was a second dose of sumatriptan given. The most common complaint was the taste of the medication (n = 4), which was not treatment limiting. No patient withdrew from the study due to an adverse event. Conclusion Intranasal sumatriptan spray may be an effective, well-tolerated, and prompt treatment for patients experiencing moderate-to-severe post-ECT headache.

Results from The Spectrum Study suggested that early treatment of migraine attacks with sumatriptan 50-mg tablets while the pain is mild might enhance pain-free response and reduce headache recurrence. Retrospective analyses of headaches treated during mild pain were performed using data from 3 studies of sumatriptan tablets (protocols S2CM09, S2BT25, and S2BT26). Our primary interest was pain-free response 2 and 4 hours after dosing; secondary interests were use of a second dose of medication, clinical disability (as measured on a 4-point disability scale), migraine-associated symptoms, meaningful pain relief (patient defined), time to meaningful relief, sustained pain-free response, and proportion of attacks in which pain had worsened 2 and 4 hours after dosing, all of which were compared in headaches treated during mild versus moderate/severe pain. In S2CM09, 92 patients treated 118 headaches during mild pain. Rates of pain-free response were higher 2 hours after dosing with sumatriptan 50 mg (51%) or 100 mg (67%; P < 0.05) compared with placebo (28%), and were higher with early treatment of mild pain compared with treatment of moderate/severe pain at 2 hours (sumatriptan 50 mg: mild pain, 51%; moderate/severe pain, 31%; P < 0.05; sumatriptan 100 mg: mild pain, 67%; moderate/severe pain, 36%) and 4 hours (50 mg: 75% vs 56%; 100 mg: 90% vs 61%; P < 0.05). Early intervention also resulted in less redosing than when moderate/severe pain was treated (50 mg: 21% vs 32%; 100 mg: 20% vs 29%). More attacks treated early with sumatriptan 50 or 100 mg were associated with normal function 4 hours after dosing compared with placebo (70% and 93% vs 46%, respectively). Sustained pain-free response rates 2 to 24 hours after early dosing with sumatriptan 50 or 100 mg were also higher (34% and 53%, respectively) compared with treatment of moderate/severe pain (19% and 24%, respectively). Early treatment with sumatriptan 100 mg produced significantly higher pain-free rates at 2 hours after dosing (P < 0.001) than did ergotamine plus caffeine (S2BT25: 69% vs 34%, respectively) or aspirin plus metoclopramide (S2BT26: 73% vs 25%, respectively). Sumatriptan 50- and 100-mg tablets are effective whether pain is mild or moderate/severe.

Use questions/a questionnaire to assess the impact on daily living and everyday activities, for diagnostic screening and to aid management decisions. Share migraine management between the clinician and the patient. Provide individualised care for migraine and encourage patients to manage their migraine.

Adapt migraine management to changes that occur in the illness and its presentation over the years. Provide acute medication to all migraine patients and recommend it is taken at the appropriate time, during the attack. Provide rescue medication/symptomatic treatment for when the initial therapy fails.

Of 108 patients successfully contacted, the incidence of headache in the first 24 hours after release was 49.1%. Forty-two patients left the ED without pain; 13 of these subsequently had return of headache. Sixty-six left with some degree of pain, with 40 having headache persistence at 24 hours. The difference in 24-hour headache rate between the 2 groups is significant (p=0.008). Five patients still had headaches at 72 hours after release, but 54 of 70 contacted had taken medication for their symptoms between 24 and 72 hours after release. Forty-five percent were not back to normal function at 24 hours, while 21 of 70 were still not sleeping well at 72 hours. Finally, 8 different classes of medications were used in the ED for migraine headaches, with 20 patients receiving at least 3 types of medication.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment for acute migraine headache in this emergency setting was variable. Patients not obtaining complete relief in the ED had a higher rate of headache after release than did those who left with no pain.

In total, 666 patients took at least one dose of study medication (326 took zolmitriptan and 340 took acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide). The percentage of patients with a 2-hour headache response after the first dose for all 3 attacks (the primary end point) was 33.4% with zolmitriptan and 32.9% with acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide [odds ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77\u20131.47; p = 0.7228]. For the majority of secondary end points, the two treatments demonstrated comparable efficacy. However, post hoc analysis showed that significantly more patients receiving zolmitriptan were free of pain 2 h after the first dose in all 3 attacks compared with patients receiving acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide (10.7 vs. 5.3%; odds ratio 2.19, 95% CI 1.23\u20134.03; p = 0.0095). In addition, post hoc analysis showed that the overall 2-hour pain-free response rate was consistently higher with zolmitriptan (34.6%) than with acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide (27.9%) (odds ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.09\u20131.78; p = 0.007). Both treatments reduced migraine-associated nausea, vomiting, phonophobia and photophobia. There were no important inter-group differences with respect to the onset of meaningful migraine relief, the frequency of headache recurrence, the usage or efficacy of a second dose of medication or the use of escape medication. However, at the last attack, the proportion of patients who expressed overall satisfaction with the treatment was significantly higher in the zolmitriptan group, i.e. 83.7%, versus 75.0% with acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide (p = 0.0346). Both agents were well tolerated. Adverse events were reported by 40.8% (133/326) of zolmitriptan-treated patients and 29.1% (99/340) of those treated with acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide. The incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was very low with both zolmitriptan (0.9%) and the combination regimen (1.5%); the latter percentage included 1 patient who withdrew from the study due to phlebitis, which was classified as a serious adverse event. This study showed that zolmitriptan is effective and well tolerated for the acute treatment of moderate to severe migraine. Zolmitriptan was at least as effective as acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide in achieving a 2-hour headache response, but significantly more effective than the combination therapy for other end points, including the 2-hour pain-free response.", "outbound_citations": ["11086366", "9886479", "10640259", "9371896", "9399016", "9399015", "9399012", "9170337", "9071264", "9071266", "9074290", "9371897", "8951929", "8791029", "8730346", "7564725", "8749241", "7672904", "24283575", "7954760", "7928312", "8008222", "8502382", "1525798", "1317294", "1727198", "3048700"], "inbound_citations": ["29235068", "27330004", "27957624", "26178694", "25877672", "25219631", "25010639", "24848613", "24400971", "23633348", "20931348", "27713337"], "label": "1"}

Paracetamol marginally increased the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) (11%) and the area under the curve (AUC) (11%) and reduced the renal clearance of zolmitriptan (9%); similar small effects were seen on 183C91. The AUC, Cmax and half-life of paracetamol were reduced by concomitant zolmitriptan (by 11%, 31% and 8%, respectively), whilst the mean residence time showed a small increase (+0.7 h). There was a trend towards a transient increase in blood pressure following all regimens containing zolmitriptan; this effect was small, was consistent between all zolmitriptan regimens as well as with previous studies, and was considered to be clinically insignificant. Zolmitriptan was well tolerated after all treatment regimens. Concomitant administration of zolmitriptan and paracetamol resulted in a slight increase in bioavailability of zolmitriptan and a reduced rate and extent of paracetamol absorption. These findings are considered to be of no clinical significance and there is no reason to avoid concomitant administration of paracetamol and/or metoclopramide with zolmitriptan.", "outbound_citations": ["786607", "9088582", "8791026", "8614525", "8838441", "7654483", "7516861", "8334575", "1336675", "7034491", "7378253", "486293", "728283", "74472", "4694406"], "inbound_citations": ["34107401", "26865407", "23018546"], "label": "0"}

The haemodynamic response to an intravenous (i.v.) infusion for 30 min of BMS-180048 (0.56 mg kg(-1) h(-1) for 10 min and 0.39 mg kg(-1) h(-1) for 20 min) was assessed via a 7F Swan Ganz catheter and thermodilution cardiac output system. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at 10 min intervals.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBMS-180048 caused a significant increase in systemic arterial systolic blood pressure (rise of 32.5 mmHg, 95% CI 24,44.5) P=0.009), pulmonary artery systolic (12.2 mmHg, 95% CI 6.8,18.5; P=0.009) and diastolic pressures (8.5 mmHg, 95% CI 5.0,13.8; P=0.009), right atrial pressure (4 mmHg, 95% CI 1.5,5.2; P=0.013) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (9.5 mmHg 95% CI 5.2,14.0; P=0.09). There was no significant change in cardiac output (0.1 l min(-1), 95% CI -0.17,0.57, P>0.05). Mean coronary artery diameter in the proximal coronary segments decreased by 0.73 mm (95% CI -1.22,-0.15; P=0.03) at 35 min. The corresponding reduction in middle segments was 0.26 mm (95% CI -0.395,-0.08; P=0.02).

The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of multiple dosing of the OC norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.035 mg (NE/EE) on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in healthy volunteers. Secondary objectives were to determine the effect of a single dose of sumatriptan on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of NE and EE, and to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination. This was an open-label, 1-sequence, crossover study in healthy women who had been receiving NE/EE for at least 3 months. Subjects received 1 cycle of NE/EE, consisting of 21 days of OC and 7 days of placebo. They also received a single dose of sumatriptan 50 mg on the last day of the OC or placebo regimen. Blood samples for the determination of plasma sumatriptan concentrations were collected on days 21 and 28, and blood samples for the determination of plasma NE and EE concentrations were collected on days 20 and 21. Treatments were compared by analysis of variance. Equivalence between treatments was to be concluded if the 90% Cl for the ratio of reference to test means for log(e)-transformed parameters (area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUCI and maximum measured plasma concentration [C(max)]) for each analyte fell within the interval 0.80 to 1.25. Twenty-six women (mean age, 29.8 years; age range, 18-44 years; weight range, 52-82 kg) participated in the study. The 90% CI for the ratio of reference to test means for the AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC(infinity)) of sumatriptan was 1.11 to 1.22, and the 90% CIs for the AUC over the dosing interval at steady state (AUC(tau)) of NE and EE were 0.96 to 1.00 and 0.91 to 0.97, respectively. The 90% CIs for the ratio of reference to test means for the C(max) of sumatriptan, NE, and EE were a respective 1.05 to 1.30, 0.76 to 0.88, and 0.88 to 1.04. Study treatments were well tolerated. Adverse events were mild or moderate, and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs or laboratory values. The extent of absorption (AUC) of sumatriptan, NE, and EE was similar after oral administration of sumatriptan and NE/EE, both alone and in combination. Thus, in the opinion of the study investigators, there were no clinically relevant changes in the AUC of any of the medications when sumatriptan and NE/EE were administered concomitantly compared with administration alone. The results of this study suggest that dose adjustment is not necessary when sumatriptan is administered concomitantly with NE/EE in healthy premenopausal women.", "outbound_citations": ["7768259", "12056924", "11554951", "11554952", "11460889", "10709161", "10524661", "10223781", "9824786", "9617601", "18370509", "7851052", "8161354", "1727198", "1653134", "1653135", "4556704"], "inbound_citations": ["26865407"], "label": "0"}

Eighty-eight patients completed the blinded study and 63 patients completed the open study. Both studies were of crossover design with patients undertaking a 4 week run-in period prior to a 12-week treatment period. Following a 4-week washout period patients commenced a second 12-week treatment period on the alternative treatment regimen. All breakthrough attacks were treated with 100 mg oral sumatriptan with an optional 2 doses available to treat any recurrence within 24 h of taking dose 1. Pizotifen was built up to a final daily dose of 1.5 mg over a 2-week period and patients remained on this dose for a further 10 weeks. Patients in the blinded study were given matching placebo tablets for one of the two treatment periods. The efficacy of sumatriptan was not affected by pizotifen. The median of the monthly attack rate experienced by patients was slightly lower whilst patients were on pizotifen and sumatriptan than while on placebo prophylaxis and sumatriptan or sumatriptan alone; study 1, 3.5 vs 3.9 attacks per month (p = 0.008); study 2, 2.9 vs. 3.2 attacks per month (p = 0.23). Also, while on pizotifen and sumatriptan more patients had a greater proportion of their time in the study migraine-free. From the results of these studies it does not appear that pizotifen reduces migraine severity; regardless of the treatment regimen the initial headache severity of most attacks was moderate. Weight gains experienced by patients while on pizotifen and sumatriptan were greater than the weight gains experienced while on placebo prophylaxis and sumatriptan or sumatriptan alone (period 1); study 1, 2.6 vs. 1.0 kg (p = 0.002); study 2, 1.6 vs. -0.8 kg (p < 0.0001). The combination of pizotifen and sumatriptan did not result in any additional adverse events other than those usually seen with each medication alone. In these studies, where the average number of migraine attacks was around 4 per month, the benefits conferred by pizotifen were at the expense of the adverse events associated with the drug, particularly weight gain. Therefore the clinical benefit of treatment with pizotifen for patients who have less than 4 attacks per month should be carefully reviewed as acute treatment with sumatriptan may be the most appropriate treatment. Pizotifen may be better reserved for those patients who have 4 of more attacks per month.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36257618", "31340760", "30880363"], "label": "0"}

After sumatriptan all subjects displayed a normal diurnal rhythm for circulating ACTH and cortisol compared with placebo. 3.

The 5 h, post-prandial, peak ACTH concentration was reduced by 21% with 100 mg (P = 0.018) and by 20% with 200 mg (P = 0.024). The weighted mean ACTH over 24 h was reduced by 8% with 100 mg (P = 0.029) and by 8% with 200 mg (P = 0.018).

Soon, seven different triptans will be clinically available at 13 different oral doses, making evidence-based selection guidelines necessary. Triptan trials have similar designs, facilitating meta-analysis. We wished to provide an evidence-based foundation for using triptans in clinical practice, and to review the methodological issues surrounding triptan trials. We asked pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigators of company-independent trials for the \u2018raw patient data\u2019 of all double-blind, randomized, controlled, clinical trials with oral triptans in migraine. All data were cross-checked with published or presented data. We calculated summary estimates across studies for important efficacy and tolerability parameters, and compared these with those from direct, head-to-head, comparator trials. Out of 76 eligible clinical trials, 53 (12 not yet published) involving 24 089 patients met the criteria for inclusion. Mean results (and 95% confidence intervals) for sumatriptan 100 mg, the first available and most widely prescribed oral triptan, are 59% (57-60) for 2 h headache response (improvement from moderate or severe to mild or no pain); 29% (27-30) for 2 h pain free (improvement to no pain); 20% (18-21) for sustained pain free (pain free by 2 h and no headache recurrence or use of rescue medication 2-24 h postdose), and 67% (63-70) for consistency (response in at least two out of three treated attacks); placebo-subtracted proportions for patients with at least one adverse event (AE) are 13% (8-18), for at least one central nervous system AE 6% (3-9), and for at least one chest AE 1.9% (1.0-2.7). Compared with these data: rizatriptan 10 mg shows better efficacy and consistency, and similar tolerability; eletriptan 80 mg shows better efficacy, similar consistency, but lower tolerability; almotriptan 12.5 mg shows similar efficacy at 2 h but better sustained pain-free response, consistency, and tolerability; sumatriptan 25 mg, naratriptan 2.5 mg and eletriptan 20 mg show lower efficacy and better tolerability; zolmitriptan 2.5 mg and 5 mg, eletriptan 40 mg, and rizatriptan 5 mg show very similar results. The results of the 22 trials that directly compared triptans show the same overall pattern. We received no data on frovatriptan, but publicly available data suggest substantially lower efficacy. The major methodological issues involve the choice of the primary endpoint, consistency over multiple attacks, how to evaluate headache recurrence, use of placebo-subtracted proportions to control for across-study differences, and the difference between tolerability and safety. In addition, there are a number of methodological issues specific for direct comparator trials, including encapsulation and patient selection. At marketed doses, all oral triptans are effective and well tolerated. Differences among them are in general relatively small, but clinically relevant for individual patients.

Methods: A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, three-period, crossover, outpatient study. Adult patients received placebo and zolmitriptan 5 mg and 10 mg orally for the acute treatment of episodic or chronic cluster headache. Headache intensity was rated by a five-point scale: none, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe. Patients only treated moderate to very severe headaches. The primary efficacy measure was headache response (two-point or greater reduction from baseline in the cluster headache rating scale) at 30 minutes. Secondary efficacy measures included proportion of patients with initial headache relief within 15 and 30 minutes, mild or no pain at 30 minutes, meaningful headache relief, and use of escape medication. Results: A total of 124 patients took at least one dose of study medication, with 73% having episodic and 27% chronic cluster headache. For the primary endpoint, there was a treatment-by-cluster-headache-type interaction (p = 0.0453). Therefore, results are presented separately for chronic and episodic cluster headache. In patients with episodic cluster headache, the difference between zolmitriptan 10 mg and placebo at 30 minutes reached significance (47% versus 29%; p = 0.02). Mild or no pain at 30 minutes was reported by 60%, 57%, and 42% patients treated with zolmitriptan 10 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg, and placebo (both p \u2264 0.01 versus placebo). For all other secondary endpoints, zolmitriptan 10 mg was significantly superior to placebo in episodic cluster headache patients, whereas zolmitriptan 5 mg was significantly superior to placebo for three of the four secondary endpoints. In patients with chronic cluster headache, response rates following zolmitriptan 5 mg or 10 mg were not significantly different from placebo at any endpoint. Zolmitriptan 5 mg and 10 mg were well tolerated. Conclusion: Oral zolmitriptan is efficacious in episodic cluster headache.", "outbound_citations": ["10395332", "9748059", "9793702", "9690407", "9665056", "9595206", "9457110", "9371896", "9399013", "9154322", "8951929", "8614525", "7617179", "7518321", "8134732", "1653136", "3768949", "3994568", "3885921", "6419759", "7085264", "7007285", "649381"], "inbound_citations": ["35315067", "33948734", "33888080", "33782592", "32739524", "31246132", "31563236", "30470171", "30393230", "29720813", "29493566", "29174963", "29231763", "27593728", "26758957"], "label": "1"}

Discontinuation of the overused headache medication, however, results in the development of withdrawal headache, often associated with nausea, vomiting, and sleep disturbances. Method: In a prospective study of 95 patients, the authors investigated the duration and severity of withdrawal headache after overuse of various headache drugs, including single and combination analgesics, ergots, and triptans. All patients underwent standard inpatient withdrawal therapy for 14 days. Results: The duration of withdrawal headache was shorter in patients overusing triptans (4.1 days) than in patients overusing ergots (6.7 days) or analgesics (9.5 days; p < 0.002). The mean headache intensity on the first day of withdrawal did not differ between the groups (p = 0.821). By day 14, however, it was lower in patients overusing triptans (0.08) than in patients overusing ergots (0.4) or analgesics (0.9; p < 0.005). Rescue medication was requested less by patients undergoing triptan withdrawal (0.25 requests) than by patients undergoing ergot withdrawal (1.25) or analgesic withdrawal (1.85; p < 0.05). Similar to findings in the entire patient population, withdrawal headache was shorter and less severe in migraineurs overusing triptans than in those overusing ergots or analgesics. Because only patients with migraine, but no patient with tension-type headache, overused triptans, withdrawal headache was shorter in the group of patients with migraine alone (6.7 days versus 9.6 days for patients with tension-type headache and 8.5 days for patients with combination headache, p < 0.02).

A decision analytic model was constructed to simulate a controlled clinical trial in which patients with migraine receiving primary medical care were randomly assigned to treatment under a stepped-care or a stratified-care regimen. A health service payer perspective was adopted and the time horizon was 1 year. Data inputs were: (i) the frequency and disability of migraine, derived from population-based studies; (ii) disability level-specific treatment response rates for over-the-counter analgesics,aspirin/metoclopramide and zolmitriptan as the representative of high-end therapy obtained from an international consensus opinion enquiry; and (iii) unit costs of healthcare obtained from UK health service sources. The estimated 1-year direct healthcare costs per primary care patient with migraine were pound sterling 156.82 for stepped care and sterling pound 151.57 for stratified care. Estimates of treatment response rates were 40 and 71% for stepped and stratified care, respectively. The cost per successfully treated attack was sterling pound 23.43 for stepped care and sterling pound 12.60 for stratified care. Stratified care remained cost effective when tested in a wide range of one-way sensitivity analyses, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed the cost effectiveness of stratified care to be significant at the 3% level. Conditional confidence analysis showed that the level of confidence in the cost effectiveness of stratified care varied positively with the case mix, i.e. in populations where the proportion of moderate and severely disabled patients with migraine was greater than 25%, the cost effectiveness of stratified care remained statistically significant. A stratified-care treatment strategy (including zolmitriptan as the representative of high-end therapy) is a highly cost-effective method of managing migraine in the primary care setting compared with stepped care, delivering improved clinical outcomes at no additional cost.", "outbound_citations": ["10179702", "10169665", "11086366", "11098098", "10496257", "10219926", "10210887", "9793711", "9399017", "9309994", "8744811", "7783866", "7869073", "8008223", "1746521", "3702625"], "inbound_citations": ["31529478", "31563229", "30681821", "27322907", "27050859", "21883198"], "label": "0"}

Patients with frequent attacks may also receive propranolol or other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists for migraine prophylaxis. The present studies investigated the potential for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between beta-adrenoceptor blockers and rizatriptan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFour double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover investigations were performed in a total of 51 healthy subjects. A single 10 mg dose of rizatriptan was administered after 7 days' administration of propranolol (60 and 120 mg twice daily), nadolol (80 mg twice daily), metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) or placebo. Rizatriptan pharmacokinetics were assessed. In vitro incubations of rizatriptan and sumatriptan with various beta-adrenoceptor blockers were performed in human S9 fraction. Production of the indole-acetic acid-MAO-A metabolite of each triptan was measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAdministration of rizatriptan during propranolol treatment (120 mg twice daily for 7.5 days) increased the AUC(0, infinity) for rizatriptan by approximately 67% and the Cmax by approximately 75%. A reduction in the dose of propranolol (60 mg twice daily) and/or the incorporation of a delay (1 or 2 h) between propranolol and rizatriptan administration did not produce a statistically significant change in the effect of propranolol on rizatriptan pharmacokinetics. Administration of rizatriptan together with nadolol (80 mg twice daily) or metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) for 7 days did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan. No untoward adverse experiences attributable to the pharmacokinetic interaction between propranolol and rizatriptan were observed, and no subjects developed serious clinical, laboratory, or other significant adverse experiences during coadministration of rizatriptan with any of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers. In vitro incubations showed that propranolol, but not other beta-adrenoceptor blockers significantly inhibited the production of the indole-acetic acid metabolite of rizatriptan and sumatriptan.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest that propranolol increases plasma concentrations of rizatriptan by inhibiting monoamine oxidase-A. When prescribing rizatriptan to migraine patients receiving propranolol for prophylaxis, the 5 mg dose of rizatriptan is recommended. Administration with other beta-adrenoceptor blockers does not require consideration of a dose adjustment.", "outbound_citations": ["10611145", "10417495", "11563413", "9748025", "9595867", "9431839", "9350384", "8912486", "8665577", "8900521", "8161354", "7924902", "8105379", "1659437", "2859169", "6122461", "7464865", "PMC2014288", "PMC2042889", "PMC1401937", "PMC1368634"], "inbound_citations": ["37185047", "36040016", "35648190", "34214182", "33478035", "33008503", "31950732", "31926835", "31809852", "31340760", "30678908", "26878379"], "label": "0"}

However, given a choice between the 2 doses, many patients in clinical practice and clinical studies prefer the 100-mg dose. This study was designed to assess whether patients initially dissatisfied with the efficacy of 50-mg sumatriptan tablets would be satisfied with 100-mg sumatriptan tablets. In phase 1 of the study, triptan-naive patients with migraine (International Headache Society diagnosis) received open-label treatment of 3 migraine attacks with 50-mg sumatriptan tablets. At the end of phase 1, those who were dissatisfied with the efficacy but satisfied with the tolerability of 50-mg sumatriptan tablets entered phase 2 and were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-group fashion to receive either 50- or 100-mg sumatriptan tablets for the treatment of 3 attacks. Patients who were satisfied with the efficacy or dissatisfied with the tolerability of the 50-mg tablets in phase 1 were given the option of continuing open-label treatment with 50-mg sumatriptan tablets in phase 2. The primary end point was the percentage of patients satisfied with medication at the end of phase 2 double-blind treatment. Patient satisfaction with specific medication attributes was assessed using the Patient Perception of Migraine Questionnaire. Seven hundred twenty-two patients were enrolled in phase 1 of the study (the intent-to-treat population), 609 of whom had evaluable satisfaction data at the end of open-label treatment. Three hundred twenty-six (54%) of these patients were satisfied with 50-mg sumatriptan tablets, whereas 283 (46%) were not satisfied. Among those who were dissatisfied, lack of efficacy was cited as the sole reason for dissatisfaction by 242 (86%). Two hundred thirty-one of those who were dissatisfied with efficacy only and wished to continue the study were randomized to double-blind treatment with either 50-mg sumatriptan tablets (n = 123; 82% female, 18% male; mean age, 37.6 years) or 100-mg sumatriptan tablets (n = 108; 86% female, 14% male; mean age, 36.0 years). The remaining 310 patients elected to continue open-label treatment with 50-mg sumatriptan tablets. At the end of double-blind treatment, 64 of 101 patients (63%) in the 100-mg group indicated that they were satisfied with treatment, compared with 55 of 113 (49%) in the 50-mg group (P = 0.031). Across the 3 attacks treated in the double-blind phase. headache relief 2 hours postdose was reported by 47% to 53% of patients in the 50-mg group and 45% to 60% of patients in the 100-mg group. The overall incidence of patients reporting > or =1 adverse event was 19% (23/123) in the 50-mg group and 22% (24/108) in the 100-mg group. For most patients, 50 mg is the appropriate starting dose of sumatriptan tablets.

New triptans in several formulations will soon become available in the United States.

Subcutaneous sumatriptan has the most rapid onset of action and greatest efficacy but the most adverse effects. Intranasal sumatriptan also has rapid onset of action, but at 2 hours its efficacy is comparable to that of oral zolmitriptan. Of the oral triptans, rizatriptan seems to have the greatest early efficacy. Both rizatriptan and zolmitriptan are now available as rapidly dissolving wafers. Almotriptan, the newest of the triptans, has a response rate similar to that of oral sumatriptan and may produce fewer adverse effects. Naratriptan and frovatriptan, with their slow onset, high tolerability, and long half-lives, may have a role in aborting prolonged migraine attacks and in headache prevention.

Following treatment, a neurology resident interviewed and examined the patients, Results. When sumatriptan was compared to placebo, significantly more of the 209 evaluable patients reported headache relief at I h (56% vs 8%, p < 0.001) and 2 h (62% vs 15%, p < 0.001) after the first injection. Resolution of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia was significantly more common in patients on sumatriptan than in those on placebo (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The adverse events were usually transient and of mild or moderate severity; however, three patients withdrew due to adverse events. Ninety-five percent of patients evaluated by a neurology resident met the IHS criteria for migraine. Conclusion. In general practice, sumatriptan taken subcutaneously using an autoinjector at home was an effective and well tolerated acute treatment for migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["8258424", "1525797", "1681162", "1851894", "1653140", "1941010", "1653142", "1653138", "2544280", "2850055", "3282670", "3048700", "3683715", "2872606", "13655060"], "inbound_citations": ["36395587", "34160823", "32436421", "27300483", "26178694", "22336869", "21298314"], "label": "1"}

We have investigated the novel antimigraine drug sumatriptan, a selective agonist for 5HT1 receptors. Its antimigraine effect may be attributed, at least in part, to constriction of cranial arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs). In assessing the peripheral vascular effects of sumatriptan we used a forearm and finger blood flow model. Forearm blood flow (FBF) is mainly determined by resistance vessels, whereas finger blood flow (FiBF) mainly involves skin vessels, which contain many AVAs.

The term complementary medicines describes a range of pharmaceutical-type preparations, including herbal medicines, homoeopathic remedies, essential oils and dietary supplements, which mainly sit outside conventional medicine. The use of complementary medicines is a popular healthcare approach in the UK, and there are signs that the use of such products is continuing to increase. Patients and the public use complementary medicines for health maintenance, for the treatment or prevention of minor ailments, and also for serious, chronic illnesses. There is a growing body of evidence from randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews to support the efficacy of certain herbal extracts and dietary supplements in particular conditions. However, many other preparations remain untested. Strictly speaking, evidence of efficacy (and safety) for herbal medicines should be considered to be extract specific.

Patients are likely to prefer agents that offer rapid relief, pain-free status within 2 hours, no recurrence or need for rescue medication, extended time to recurrence (if present), consistency of therapeutic effect over multiple attacks, oral administration. good tolerability, safety, and minimal drug interactions. Fortunately, a number of specific therapies now are available which place these objectives within the patient's reach. Ongoing barriers to optimal migraine care include underrecognition, underconsultation, undertreatment, restrictions imposed by insurance companies, and exaggerated concerns regarding the safety of the triptans. Overcoming these barriers is likely to prove a more important contribution to patient care than endeavoring to establish the relative merits of one triptan over another. We have described in detail a number of strategies for improving recognition and treatment of migraine. Many headache specialists now believe that recurrent episodes of disabling headache, with a stable pattern over years, should be viewed as migraine until proven otherwise. In the end, this may represent the most useful paradigm in the primary care setting, where time is of the essence. Studies to validate this approach are needed. Acute treatment intervention that is based on scientific evidence, clinical experience, and patients' needs and desires will provide better outcomes than those presently obtained. Preliminary evidence favors early intervention with oral triptans, and randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, ideally employing a crossover design, are required to confirm this. The US Consortium's evidence-based guidelines, the National Headache Foundation's standards of care, and the Canadian guidelines have applied the standards of scientific inquiry to the field of headache management and \"translation\" of these guidelines into practical instruments for clinicians through vehicles such as the Primary Care Network's Patient-Centered Strategies for Effective Management of Migraine should raise the general standard of care for patients with migraine. Last, but far from least, initiatives undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) will add credibility to the many layfolk and professionals who have struggled to present headache as a disabling disorder worthy of scientific investigation and aggressive medical management. The WHO states: \"These common complaints impose a significant health burden ... Despite this, both the public and the majority of healthcare professionals tend to perceive headache as a minor or trivial complaint. As a result, the physical, emotional, social and economic burdens of headache are poorly acknowledged in comparison with those of other, less prevalent, neurologic disorders.\" Migraine is finally out of the closet.", "outbound_citations": ["11380642", "11135022", "11135021", "11167896", "11206862", "10993991", "10980753", "11048903", "10982092", "10999673", "10759909", "10636142", "11152011", "10586385", "10376167", "10640258", "9748025", "9665056", "9595867", "9563208", "9482363", "9409334", "9371896", "9439085", "9170336", "9056052", "8933995", "8991488", "8530277", "7672955", "8190298", "8190284", "8163368", "7835380", "8258424", "1727198", "1851894", "1653135", "3282670", "3048700"], "inbound_citations": ["28721535", "28401499", "27103792", "25881677", "24102322", "21533717"], "label": "0"}

Results from controlled clinical trials demonstrate efficacy superior to placebo and an adverse event rate comparable to that with placebo. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of oral almotriptan on the use of rescue medication in the treatment of acute migraine attacks. Three Phase II and III, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies of almotriptan used as the basis for regulatory approval of the drug were included in the analysis. Two studies (1 single dose, 1 multiple dose) assessed almotriptan 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg and a third compared almotriptan 12.5 mg and sumatriptan 100 mg. Primary results from all 3 trials were previously published. Rescue medication was permitted if migraine pain had not decreased to mild severity or to no pain at 2 hours after study medication. The primary end point of this analysis was use of rescue medication. A total of 1777 patients were included in the analysis. Mean patient age ranged from 39.4 to 44.0 years; approximately 87% were women, and >98% were white. Patients were well matched for demographic characteristics. Overall, use of rescue medication was significantly lower with almotriptan 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg compared with placebo (P < or = 0.05 for each group). No significant difference was noted between the almotriptan 12.5-mg and sumatriptan 100-mg groups. In 2 of the studies, patients with moderate or severe baseline pain used significantly less rescue medication in the almotriptan groups compared with placebo. Oral almotriptan 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg significantly reduced use of rescue medication compared with placebo among patients with acute migraine.

Overall, subjects received almost 50,000 doses; 97% of exposures were at doses > or = 2.5 mg. In the clinical pharmacology studies, the overall incidence of subject exposures experiencing at least one adverse event was 52% with zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (28% with placebo). In placebo-controlled studies, the overall incidence of patients with at least one adverse event was dose-dependent for zolmitriptan over the 1-15 mg dose range, e.g. 42% and 46% with 1 and 2.5 mg, respectively and 58% with 5 mg (29% with placebo). Only four serious adverse events attributable to zolmitriptan were reported. In a long-term study, during which 2,058 outpatients treated a total of 31,579 migraine attacks with either one or two zolmitriptan 5 mg doses over a period of up to 1 year, the number of attacks associated with at least one adverse event was similar after one (26%) and two (24%) doses. The majority (59%) of the adverse events reported in this study (59%) occurred within 2 h of dosing, were predominantly mild (59%) or moderate (35%) in intensity, of < or = 4 h duration (58%), required no further action (94%). In placebo-controlled studies, the percentage of patients who reported severe adverse events was similar with zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (4%) and placebo (5%). The most frequently reported adverse events with zolmitriptan in the placebo-controlled clinical studies were asthenia, heaviness (other than chest or neck), dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, paresthesia and warm sensations. The type and severity of the adverse events was not influenced by gender (although the frequency of reported adverse events was higher in females, as was the case in the placebo group), age, presence of aura prior to the attack, association of migraine with menstruation, concurrent medication, or by the addition of a second zolmitriptan dose. Zolmitriptan showed a similar tolerability profile in the long-term study, in which a low withdrawal rate due to adverse events of 8% was observed. Zolmitriptan was not associated with an increased frequency of central nervous system-related adverse events in a comparative study of sumatriptan, despite pre-clinical and neurophysiological evidence of a dual peripheral and central action of zolmitriptan. Moreover, zolmitriptan doses of 5-20 mg produced no statistically significant effects on objective assessments of psychometric function. Zolmitriptan had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure (even in patients with controlled mild to moderate hypertension or impaired renal function), ECGs (e.g. there was no evidence of ischemic events) or clinical chemistry, hematological or urinalysis measurements. In summary, zolmitriptan is well tolerated, particularly at the recommended dose of 2.5 mg. Zolmitriptan has a well-defined dose-response with 2.5 mg proving highly effective and optimizing the benefit/risk ratio of treatment. Thus, zolmitriptan is well suited as an acute oral treatment for migraine in the outpatient setting.", "outbound_citations": ["9088582", "9399013", "9399015", "9399012", "9071268", "9058397", "8912486", "8951929", "8838441", "8791027", "7672955", "8502382", "3048700"], "inbound_citations": ["34001002", "33208542"], "label": "1"}

All five domains showed significant responses within subjects from a migraine\u2010free period to an acute migraine period (P<0.0001). In summary, the migraine quality of life questionnaire showed good internal consistency, construct and discriminant validity, and responsiveness to acute migraine attacks.", "outbound_citations": ["10183310", "7635717", "8190284", "8258424", "8376093", "8450681", "1549827", "1983126", "3955482", "3972947"], "inbound_citations": ["33396262", "32748408", "30806518", "29553695", "29037089", "28918732"], "label": "0"}

In addition, at least three others are in advanced stage of clinical development (almotriptan, eletriptan, and frovatriptan). This paper sets out to review the recent data with the aim of identifying: 1) What are the critical differences between the TELs and sumatriptan? 2) How do the currently licensed TELs compare? 3) Is it possible to provide a rational approach to migraine therapy based on objective differences in the clinical profile of these new drugs? Recent randomised controlled and comparator data were reviewed, including the independent FDA assessment of rizatriptan. Critical differences for the new TELs (naratriptan, rizatriptan and zolmitriptan) which may lead to more rational migraine management: Both rizatriptan (10 mg) and zolmitriptan (2.5 mg and 5.0 mg) have demonstrated superior efficacy to sumatriptan 100 mg, and 25 and 50 mg respectively. Therefore, for first line use either rizatriptan or zolmitriptan would be appropriate for moderate and severe headache. Rizatriptan has a more rapid onset of action than sumatriptan 100 mg. Both rizatriptan and zolmitriptan have a more rapid onset of action than naratriptan. Therefore, for a rapid onset of action either rizatriptan or zolmitriptan would be appropriate. Naratriptan would appear to have a lower recurrent headache rate than sumatriptan, rizatriptan or zolmitriptan. However, 24-hour efficacy rates for zolmitriptan 2.5 mg were significantly greater than for sumatriptan 25 mg and 50 mg and were not significantly different from naratriptan. Therefore, for headaches of long duration and with a tendency to recur (e.g. menstrual headaches) either naratriptan or zolmitriptan would be appropriate. Naratriptan has lower reported adverse event rates comparable with placebo. This would support the use of naratriptan 2.5 mg in patients who have demonstrated poor tolerance to the \"triptan type\" adverse events.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["11772292"], "label": "0"}

The phase IIa naratriptan data were used to check the PK-PD model in its ability to describe future data. A further PK-PD model was developed by using the phase IIa naratriptan data, and a phase IIb trial was designed by simulation with the use of Matlab. The design resulting from clinical trial simulation was compared with that derived by using D-optimal design. The PK-PD model showed reasonable agreement with the data observed in the phase IIa naratriptan clinical trial. Clinical trial simulation resulted in a design with four or five arms at 0 mg, 2.5 and/or 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg, PD measurements to be taken at 0, 2, and 4 or 6 h and at least 150 patients per arm.

Given that eletriptan has higher bioavailability (50%) than sumatriptan (140%),' is two orders of magnitude more lipophilic than sumatriptan, and has fourand eightfold higher affinity than sumatriptan for the 5HTrn and 5HTrn receptor, it is odd that such a high dose of eletriptan is required to produce a therapeutic effect. One possible explanation may be that triptans act centrally as well as peripherally. If this theory is true, eletriptan would have to overcome the P-glycoprotein efflux pump to produce adequate cerebral concentrations to mediate a response. The authors state that eletriptan has a higher craniocoronary selectivity than sumatriptan. It would of course be quite inappropriate to extrapolate this finding to a benefit in clinical practice. The authors cite the study of Muir to contend that eletriptan produced no significant change in coronary artery diameters. In that same study one patient experienced marked segmental coronary artery spasm in association with the eletriptan infusion, which was unresponsive to sublingual glyceryl trinitrate. Furthermore, in a direct comparative clinical study, the incidence of chest symptoms was similar between the eletriptan and sumatriptan treatment groups: While we accept that such symptoms are usually not due to coronary ischaemia, this illustrates that preclinical findings should not be taken out of their proper context. Eletriptan may be absorbed rapidly in normal volunteers, with a Tmax of one hour, but this is not the case during a migraine attack, where gastric paresis may delay absorption. The T max for eletriptan during a migraine attack is prolonged to 2.8 hours.

The use of scintigraphic techniques has established that gastric emptying is abnormally slow in approx. 30\u201350% of outpatients with long\u2010standing Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, although the magnitude of this delay is modest in many cases. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms occur frequently and affect quality of life adversely in patients with diabetes, although the relationship between symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying is weak. Acute changes in blood glucose concentration affect both gastric motor function and upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastric emptying is slower during hyperglycaemia when compared with euglycaemia and accelerated during hypoglycaemia. The blood glucose concentration may influence the response to prokinetic drugs. Conversely, the rate of gastric emptying is a major determinant of post\u2010prandial glycaemic excursions in healthy subjects, as well as in Type 1 and Type 2 patients. A number of therapies currently in development are designed to improve post\u2010prandial glycaemic control by modulating the rate of delivery of nutrients to the small intestine.", "outbound_citations": ["14687168", "10389675", "10063912", "9539642", "8777999", "7672483", "8405758", "2076799", "2753246", "2070801", "8150234", "12647844", "11511562", "11423513", "11182211", "11316144", "11316143", "11207504", "11207870", "11213895", "11136287", "11049905", "11034582", "11025791", "11016458", "10977012", "10995791", "10886051", "10869894", "10859225", "10805824", "10811324", "10794683", "10819233", "10712279", "10762615", "10754365", "10636066", "10594405", "10594392", "10651258", "10575028", "10765008", "10478880", "10566120", "10477212", "10695417", "10404803", "10421239", "10391397", "10365900", "10372186", "10445530", "10078820", "10029616", "10097936", "29597691", "29597666", "10333955", "10096791", "9862828", "10201457", "9834261", "9868975", "29585888", "9773734", "9721173", "9863486", "9632123", "9614619", "9669631", "9663360", "9690728", "9540029", "9496935", "9496952", "9507911", "9541166", "9421380", "9505868", "9285204", "9352855", "9414968", "9306286", "9203450", "9223392", "9203452", "9207262", "9177513", "9135954", "9203944", "9051397", "9058388", "9051396", "9118759", "9028694", "9049472", "8944695", "8842608", "8842617", "8799639", "8725876", "8738309", "8737031", "8732711", "8732710", "8612991", "8742573", "8742562", "8720528", "8550773", "8523109", "7485502", "7657103", "8525655", "7672674", "8586005", "7875475", "7825766", "7712661", "7926503", "7956640", "8039617", "8020687", "8026279", "8154027", "8307466", "8403829", "8513988", "8512437", "8503391", "8424421", "8472616", "1499927", "1427371", "1634941", "1415139", "1614777", "1612359", "1568568", "1817817", "1912656", "1882011", "2040467", "1804583", "2084820", "2288830", "2148129", "2320062", "2302821", "2773901", "2756978", "2764113", "2650735", "2644150", "2919683", "3345891", "3338642", "3321924", "3632153", "3622202", "3569766", "3556999", "2952428", "3545642", "3799578", "3699409", "3519058", "3801726", "3890540", "2862896", "3965339", "6441717", "6468877", "6392216", "6147174", "6747645", "6370777", "6478096", "6400707", "7431111", "7408609", "456768", "931480", "765178", "1131624", "5640772", "13837101", "13521605", "14894451", "14897071", "14887845", "14873026", "18921561", "16694753"], "inbound_citations": ["36266449", "36250715", "36079153", "35949825", "35676794", "35453703", "35253251", "34995804", "34957654", "34088949", "33776789", "33644895", "32979852", "32515089", "32016844", "32967621", "31571683", "31314613", "31301103", "31081877", "33442139", "31000505", "31024314", "30690693", "31024314", "30537714", "30402500", "29880750", "29235555", "28736244", "26852626", "28438778", "28163260", "28188572", "30148558", "28140326", "27667549", "27385796", "27166926", "27302177", "26382050", "28531736", "26456775", "26424043", "25995347", "26011905", "25725624", "26268133", "25482224", "25667022", "25047170", "24876054", "25222222", "24837558", "24647737", "25024625", "24876417", "24964851", "24760120", "24323633", "23953884", "24341686", "24417833", "24417824", "24197805", "24324393", "23848826", "24036253", "23835688", "23956012", "23761104", "24311844", "23807643", "23534498", "23350946", "23316944", "23431049", "23279217", "22668340", "22944318", "22731792", "22721966", "22079939", "22510316", "22160540", "22459243", "22302242", "19496627", "23165572", "22420866", "21615667", "21777300", "21813291", "21255977", "21396142", "22189550", "21735078", "21679344", "21992252", "21409601", "21087356", "21214610", "21519398", "20949311", "21095542", "20524987", "21103422", "20508223", "20420555", "20380013", "20093561"], "label": "0"}

It affects 18% of women and 6.5% of men in the United States, almost half of whom are undiagnosed or undertreated (1, 2). These guidelines, developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of PhysiciansAmerican Society of Internal Medicine, with assistance from the American Headache Society, are based on two previously published papers (3, 4). The papers, titled Evidence-Based Guidelines for Migraine Headache in the Primary Care Setting: Pharmacological Management of Acute Attacks, by Matchar and colleagues (3), and Evidence-Based Guidelines for Migraine Headache in the Primary Care Setting: Pharmacological Management for Prevention of Migraine, by Ramadan and coworkers (4), can be found at www.aan.com/professionals/practice/guidelines.cfm.1 The target audience for this guideline is primary care physicians. The guideline applies to patients with acute migraine attacks, with or without aura, and patients with migraine who are candidates for preventive drug therapy. Although these guidelines are all based on the articles by Matchar and Ramadan and colleagues, the recommendations may differ because different thresholds of evidence were needed for making a positive recommendation. Table 1 compares the AAFP/ACPASIM guideline and the U.S. Headache Consortium Guideline. Table 1. Summary of U.S. Headache Consortium Recommendations Compared with AAFP/ACPASIM Recommendations Throughout the text, asterisks indicate drugs that are currently not available in the United States. Diagnosis Headache has many potential causes. Most headaches are caused by the primary headache disorders, which include migraine, cluster, and tension-type headaches. Secondary headaches, which are those with underlying pathologic causes, are far less common. Migraine is a chronic condition with recurrent acute attacks whose characteristics vary among patients and often among attacks within a single patient. Migraine is a syndrome with a wide variety of neurologic and non-neurologic manifestations. The International Headache Society (6) has developed diagnostic criteria for migraine with and without aura (Appendix Table 1). This classification system serves to diagnose headache syndromes, not patients. Thus, one patient could have more than one type of headache disorder. For example, it is not uncommon for migraine patients to also have episodic tension-type headaches. Management of Acute Attacks Effective long-term management of patients with migraine is challenging because of the complexity of the condition. Experts suggest several goals for successful treatment of acute attacks of migraine. These include treating attacks rapidly and consistently to avoid headache recurrence, to restore the patient's ability to function, and to minimize the use of backup and rescue medications. Clinicians need to educate people with migraine about their condition and its treatment and encourage them to participate in their own management. The physician must help the patient establish realistic expectations by discussing therapeutic options and their benefits and harms. Patient input can provide the best guide to treatment selection and helps the physician to better understand and accommodate patient treatment goals. Developing an effective acute migraine management strategy can be complex, and an engaged patient is more likely to negotiate this process successfully. Encouraging patients to identify and avoid triggers (Table 2) and to be actively involved in their own management by tracking their own progress may be especially useful. Table 2. Some Commonly Reported Triggers of Migraine Headache Once a diagnosis of migraine is established, patients and their health care providers should decide together how to treat acute attacks and whether the patient is a candidate for preventive medications. A wide range of acute treatments with varying efficacies is currently in use (Appendix Table 2). A comprehensive review of the scientific literature, especially the data from randomized, controlled trials, provides a list of treatments that have demonstrated efficacy in the management of acute migraine headache. It also provides a clear understanding of the adverse events associated with various agents. The Headache Consortium's review of the evidence on antiemetics, barbiturate hypnotics, ergot alkaloids and derivatives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), combination analgesics and nonopiate analgesics, opiate analgesics, triptans, and other agents found good evidence of the efficacy of only a few agents in the treatment of acute migraine (3). Available Agents NSAIDs Their demonstrated efficacy and favorable tolerability make NSAIDs a first-line treatment choice for all migraine attacks, including severe attacks that have responded to NSAIDs in the past. Among the NSAIDs, the most consistent evidence exists for aspirin (8-10), ibuprofen (11, 12), naproxen sodium (13, 14), tolfenamic acid* (8, 15), and the combination agent acetaminophen plus aspirin plus caffeine for the acute treatment of migraine (16). The evidence shows that acetaminophen alone is ineffective (17). Serotonin1B/1D Agonists (Triptans) There is good evidence for the effectiveness of the oral triptans naratriptan (18, 19), rizatriptan (20-23), sumatriptan (24-31), and zolmitriptan (32-34). In addition, there is good evidence for the effectiveness of subcutaneous (35-38) and intranasal (39-41) sumatriptan, making it an option for patients with nausea and vomiting. Adverse effects of the triptans include chest symptoms, but postmarketing data indicate that true ischemic events are rare. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with risk for heart disease, basilar or hemiplegic migraine, or uncontrolled hypertension. Subcutaneous sumatriptan is associated with a very rapid onset of action, and oral naratriptan is associated with a slower onset of action. Ergotamines There is good evidence for the efficacy and safety of intranasal dihydroergotamine (DHE) as monotherapy for acute migraine attacks (42-46). Placebo-controlled studies of intravenous DHE did not clearly establish its efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine (47, 48). The evidence was inconsistent to support efficacy of ergotamine or ergotaminecaffeine, and the studies documented frequent adverse events. Opioids It is well recognized that opiates are good analgesics, but there is good evidence only for the efficacy of butorphanol nasal spray (49, 50). Although opioids are commonly used, surprisingly few studies of opioid use in headache pain document whether overuse and the development of dependence are as frequent as clinically perceived. Until further data are available, these drugs may be better reserved for use when other medications cannot be used, when sedation effects are not a concern, or the risk for abuse has been addressed. Other Agents Fair evidence suggests that the antiemetic metoclopramide, given intravenously, may be an appropriate choice as monotherapy for acute attacks (51-53), particularly in patients with nausea and vomiting when the sedating side effect may also be useful. Isometheptene and isometheptene combinations obtained only borderline significance in relieving headache pain (17, 54, 55). Other agents used in practice, such as intravenous corticosteroids and intranasal lidocaine, are not effective. Choice of Treatment Since patient responses to these therapies are not always predictable, individualized management is important. The choice of treatment should be based on, among other characteristics, the frequency and severity of attacks; the presence and degree of temporary disability; and the profile of associated symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting. The patient's history of, response to, and tolerance for specific medications must also be considered. Coexisting conditions (such as heart disease, pregnancy, and uncontrolled hypertension) may limit treatment choices. No studies document the effectiveness of specific treatment schedules, but experts suggest that acute therapy should be limited to no more than two times per week to guard against medication-overuse headache (or drug-induced headache). Medication-overuse headache is thought to result from frequent use of acute medication and has a pattern of increasing headache frequency, often resulting in daily headaches. In patients with suspected medication overuse or patients at risk for medication overuse, preventive migraine therapy should be considered. Although some use the term rebound headache interchangeably with the term medication-overuse headache, rebound headache is a distinct entity. Rebound headache is associated with withdrawal of analgesics or abortive migraine medication. There is no uniform agreement about which agents can cause rebound headache, although ergotamine (not DHE); opiates; triptans; and simple and mixed analgesics containing butalbital, caffeine, or isometheptene are generally thought to do so. There is less uniform opinion about other antimigraine agents. Another clinical consideration is the use of a self-administered rescue medication for patients with severe migraine attack that is not responding to (or failing) other treatments. A rescue medication is an agent such as an opioid or a butalbital-containing compound that the patient can use at home when other treatments have failed. Although rescue medications often do not completely eliminate pain and allow patients to return to normal activities, they permit the patient to achieve relief without the discomfort and expense of a visit to the physician's office or emergency department. A cooperative arrangement between provider and patient may extend to the use of rescue medication in appropriate situations. Summary of Treatment of Acute Migraine A body of evidence now points to effective first- and second-line agents for acute treatment of migraine. Beyond the choice of agent lies the ", "outbound_citations": ["7964913", "8164015", "11554952", "11554951", "11086374", "10214771", "15613167", "9673809", "9595867", "9563208", "9563211", "9482363", "9409334", "9371896", "9439085", "9371898", "9350384", "9371897", "8912486", "8665577", "8614525", "8970458", "7486359", "7644079", "7644082", "7601299", "7872882", "7737863", "7775172", "7954759", "8164818", "8062355", "8145914", "8427430", "1333181", "1446992", "1623513", "1576648", "1551787", "1647495", "1851894", "1653141", "1653138", "2074163", "2074162", "2221512", "2692838", "2676908", "3197098", "3139584", "3277926", "3048700", "3322569", "3308768", "3301001", "3524092", "3519528", "3727918", "3516409", "3514491", "4022376", "3902723", "4004602", "3886154", "6325065", "6394143", "6150909", "6387197", "6375873", "6640652", "6352046", "6350226", "6131052", "7031016", "7021472", "6989789", "511540", "508127", "89390", "367043", "363486", "368333", "348647", "339659", "330465", "327746", "977330", "1107267", "800690", "1100566", "1100565", "1095308", "4611129", "4599014", "4604015", "4110641", "5554982", "4925988", "4892617", "5328472", "14155162", "13928400"], "inbound_citations": ["37038134", "36792981", "36700155", "36505141", "34932787", "34362203", "32956223", "32436242", "31895267", "31302899", "31563229", "28248698", "26950804", "28586886", "28097095", "27595607", "27228039", "27091721", "27017017"], "label": "1"}

Almotriptan was effective in animal models predictive of anti-migraine activity in humans and had a good safety profile in animal studies. From the toxicological point of view, almotriptan has a profile similar to that of other marketed triptans. In animal studies, at levels substantially higher than required for therapeutic activity in humans, almotriptan was devoid of any oncogenic, genotoxic or teratogenic effects. Almotriptan is well absorbed orally; its absolute bioavailability in humans is 70%. Its peak plasma levels are reached at 1 to 3 h after its administration; its elimination half-life is 3 to 4 h. Almotriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase-mediated oxidative deamination and cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation as the major metabolic route and by flavin monooxygenase as the minor route. No dose adjustment is required for gender or age, and only in the case of severe renal impairment the dose should not exceed 12.5 mg over a 24-h period. There was no significant interaction between a single dose of almotriptan and propranolol, fluoxetine or verapamil, at multiple doses. The efficacy of almotriptan in the treatment of acute migraine was demonstrated in clinical trials on more than 3000 patients with migraine. At two h after oral administration of almotriptan, 12.5 mg, the percentages of patients showing pain relief and a pain-free score were 64 and 36%, respectively. The effects of almotriptan were significantly better than those of placebo. When almotriptan was administered in the early phase of migraine, the percentage of pain-free patients at 2 h rose to 84%. In a phase III, double-blind and placebo-controlled study, the incidence of adverse events with almotriptan was not statistically different from that of placebo.

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan nasal spray (NS; 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg) with placebo for the treatment of acute migraine in adolescents. Methods. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-attack study was conducted in 653 US adolescents (12\u201317 years of age). Patients with at least a 6-month history of migraine, who met International Headache Society criteria for migraine (with or without aura) were eligible for participation. Headache relief 2 hours postdose, complete relief, presence or absence of associated symptoms, headache recurrence, and use of rescue medications were recorded. The primary efficacy endpoint was headache relief 2 hours postdose sumatriptan NS (20 mg) versus placebo. Safety and tolerability were assessed by examining adverse events, changes in electrocardiograms, vital signs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. Results. Headache relief 1 hour postdose was significantly greater for patients using 10 mg (56%) and 20 mg (56%) of sumatriptan NS compared with placebo (41%). Headache relief 2 hours postdose was significantly greater for patients using 5 mg of sumatriptan NS (66%) compared with placebo (53%), and approached statistical significance for 20 mg (63%) compared with placebo (53%). Complete relief 2 hours postdose was significantly greater for patients using 20 mg of sumatriptan NS compared with placebo (36% vs 25%, respectively). Each dose of sumatriptan (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg) was superior to placebo with respect to the cumulative percentages of patients first reporting headache relief within 2 hours of dosing (Kaplan-Meier). The sumatriptan 20-mg dose was superior to placebo with respect to the cumulative percentages of patients first reporting complete relief within 2 hours of dosing (Kaplan-Meier). Photophobia and phonophobia were significantly reduced 2 hours postdose for sumatriptan NS (20 mg), compared with placebo (36% vs 48% and 25% vs 44%, respectively). Taste disturbance was the most commonly reported adverse event (2%, 19%, 30%, and 26% for placebo, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg, respectively). No drug-related serious adverse events or clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters, electrocardiograms, or vital signs were reported. Conclusions. Sumatriptan NS is effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of acute migraine in adolescents, with the 20-mg dose providing the best overall efficacy and tolerability profiles.", "outbound_citations": ["10499172", "10213879", "10209349", "9673808", "9596457", "9371898", "9313279", "8980856", "8783474", "8675428", "7672958", "7843952", "7950559", "7880221", "8200027", "8258424", "8262782", "8220421", "8135109", "1525799", "1851894", "1653140", "2926969", "3282670", "3048700", "6826345"], "inbound_citations": ["35207430", "32464520", "31563234", "31529481", "31413171", "30804170", "30786733", "30526161", "30074552", "30050027", "30038237", "29479263", "26359825", "28435313", "27858938", "28129702", "28192509", "26359823", "26968976", "27091010", "26790849", "26788131", "26647374"], "label": "1"}

All three doses of eletriptan were statistically superior to placebo for headache response and headache\u2010free patients. The 80 mg dose of eletriptan was also superior to sumatriptan 100 mg. Headache recurrence, defined as return of moderate or severe headache within 24 hours of dosing and following a headache response at two hours after initial dosing, occurred in 33% of the patients following 100 mg sumatriptan and in 28%, 34% and 32% after 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg eletriptan.

Clinical trials have shown beneficial effects of the vasodilatory action of CGRP in hypertension, angina, heart failure, Raynaud\u2019s disease and venous stasis ulcers.

A minority of migraine attacks are preceded by transient visual or sensory disturbances. Migraine is associated with reductions in health-related quality of life both during and between attacks. Despite methodological limitations in cost-of-illness studies, it is clear that the cost of migraine to society is substantial. Indirect costs (primarily workplace productivity losses) make up 75 to 90% of total costs. Direct costs, such as the cost of drug treatment, physician consultation, hospitalisation and emergency room treatment, make up most of the remainder. Sumatriptan is an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of migraine. Its main advantage over other agents used in the acute management of migraine appears to be its rapid onset of action. Sumatriptan reduces headache severity within 2 hours of oral administration in 50 to 67% of patients and within 1 hour of subcutaneous administration in 70 to 80% of patients. Headache recurs in approximately 40% of patients who initially respond to oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan; however, a second dose of the drug is effective against the symptoms of recurrence in a majority of patients. Some patients experience relief of non-headache migraine symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. Adverse events reported after sumatriptan are generally mild and transient. Data from studies of patients who used their usual therapies and sumatriptan in nonblinded, sequential phases indicate that both workplace and nonworkplace productivity losses were reduced during sumatriptan therapy. A cost-benefit analysis applied to some of these workplace productivity data indicated that, including direct costs and productivity savings, sumatriptan was associated with a net reduction in total cost of migraine. In retrospective cost analyses, sumatriptan was associated with increased prescription costs: the effect of the drug on other direct treatment costs was less clear. A retrospective pharmacoeconomic model suggested that the cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous sumatriptan versus subcutaneous dihydroergotamine depended on which outcome measure was of greatest interest. For measures of rapid relief of migraine, sumatriptan was superior, but the cost of achieving rapid relief was substantial. Sumatriptan improved global quality-of-life scores compared with patients' usual therapy in a randomised crossover trial and appeared to do the same when the drugs were administered in nonblinded, sequential phases in trials which used general and migraine-specific quality-of-life instruments. Thus, sumatriptan is associated with a fast onset of action and improvements in health-related quality of life in patients with migraine. However, the cost of achieving rapid relief of migraine symptoms may be substantial. Compared with patients' usual treatments, sumatriptan appeared to reduce workplace and non-workplace productivity losses. However, few economic data from well controlled prospective comparisons of sumatriptan with other available agents are available to quantify the effect of sumatriptan on the overall cost of migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["9001842", "8912486", "8916561", "8984084", "8639069", "8730346", "7564725", "7758095", "7928312", "7928313", "7516861", "8376093", "8436495", "1525797", "1525798", "1599358", "1379152", "1317294", "1727198", "8537803", "1653139", "8749245", "10146975", "10155303", "10147352", "10146980", "8900548", "10160470", "10146974", "1647495", "8749242", "7835383", "8008226", "8578295", "8334575", "3048700", "10147025", "8105379", "10146911"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Thirty-six hundred cGy will result in a 20- to 30-point decline in IQ score over a 3- to 4-year period in children with medulloblastoma between 3 and 7 years of age.3 However, the cognitive sequelae of whole brain radiotherapy are not well delineated in adults and the potential detrimental effects of partial brain radiotherapy is even less well characterized.4-7\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3 Two articles in this issue of Neurology address the effects of local brain radiotherapy. Armstrong et al.8 describe the cognitive and radiographic outcome of 26 patients with low-grade, supratentorial brain tumors followed prospectively for up to 6 years. Postma et al.9 evaluated neuroradiographic abnormalities and neuropsychological performance in 49 patients with low-grade gliomas, 23 of whom had been treated with local radiotherapy.

However, 30-40% of the patients commonly present recurrence before 24 hours therefore requiring another dose. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) such as tolfenamic acid and naproxen sodium combined with sumatriptan have demonstrated efficacy in reducing recurrence observed with the single use of this drug. Steroids also have been suggested to treat refractory migraine and status migranosus. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients presenting frequent recurrence with the combination triptan plus NSAID, would decrease it with the association of dexamethasone.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTwenty three patients, 17 women and 6 men with migraine according to IHS criteria were prospectively studied. All patients presented frequent recurrence (> or= 60%, mean recurrence rate 74,8%) with the single use of sumatritpan 100 mg or zolmitriptan 2,5 mg or rizatriptan 10mg in at least 5 consecutive attacks, and didn't present a reduction of the recurrence rate superior than 20% with the combination of tolfenamic acid 200 mg or rofecoxib 25 mg in at least 5 other consecutive attacks (mean recurrence rate 60%). The patients had to treat 6 consecutive moderate or severe migraine attacks with their usual combination plus 4 mg of dexamathasone with a maximum of twice a week, and fill out a diary reporting headache parameters.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty patients, 16 women and 4 men completed the study. Of those who completed the study, 11 took rizatriptan plus rofecoxib, 4 rizatriptan plus tolfenamic acid, 3 zolmitriptan plus rofecoxib, 1 zolmitriptan plus tolfenamic acid and 1 patient took sumatriptan plus tolfenamic acid, having the 20 patients taken as a third medication, a single tablet of 4 mg of dexamethasone. All patients took oral formulations and none presented vomiting after that. Among all 20 patients, one female and one male patient presented recurrence in 3 out of the 6 attacks (50%) while the remaining 18 patients revealed recurrence in 1 or 2 treated attacks (mean 23,4%) (p<0,001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe concluded that the judicious use of oral dexamethasone might be useful for a limited population of migraine patients still presenting recurrence with the combination of a triptan and a NSAID.

Results of this study indicate that IV doses of MK-462 from 5 to 90 micrograms kg-1 are well tolerated. The disposition kinetics of MK-462 were linear for IV doses up to and including 60 micrograms kg-1. The values of the plasma clearance (CL), steady-state volume of distribution (Vss), plasma terminal half-life (t1/2), and mean residence time in the body (MRT) of MK-462 averaged 1376 mL min-1, 140 L, 1.8 h, and 1.7 h, respectively, and remained essentially constant over the dosage range of 10-60 micrograms kg-1 of IV MK-462. However, as the dose increased from 60 to 90 micrograms kg-1, the mean value of the apparent CL decreased from 1376 to 807 mL min-1. Thus, elimination of MK-462 was dose dependent in this dosage range. Based on the disposition decomposition analysis (DDA), it was shown that the Vss value of MK-462 remained essentially constant over the dosage range of 10-90 micrograms kg-1 of IV MK-462. The following values of two dose-independent parameters were also calculated by using DDA: distribution clearance (CLd) = 2028 mL min-1, and mean transit time in the peripheral tissues (MTTT) = 0.74 h.

Although administration of a standard breakfast prior to dosing increased the AUC value (by approximately 20%) of MK-462 and delayed its absorption, there were no significant effects of the meal on the values of Cmax and apparent t1/2 of MK-462.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Migraine attacks are often treated with simple analgesics or with ergotamme-containing preparations alone or in combination with anti-emetics. Although also sometimes used to treat migraine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials, particularly in comparison with the newer drug sumatriptan. Sumatriptan is a specific migraine treatment which has recently become among the most widely prescribed acute migraine therapies. However, while effective, it has low oral bioavailability and some problematic adverse effects. Diclofenac-potassium is a potent NSAID available as a fast-acting oral tablet, which has been shown to be safe and effective in several other acute pain indications. In the clinical trial reported here, the efficacy and safety of diclofenac-potassium in the acute treatment of migraine attacks has been tested in comparison with oral sumatriptan and placebo. Methods. Single oral doses of 50 mg and 100 mg diclofenac-potassium were compared to a single oral dose of 100 mg sumatriptan and placebo in a double-blind randomized crossover trial in 156 adult patients suffering from migraine attacks, with or without aura, selected according to the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria. The primary efficacy criterion was migraine headache pain recorded on a visual analog scale at 2 h after dosing. Secondary endpoints included pain at other time points up to 8 h and the presence of accompanying symptoms (nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia). Findings. Diclofenac-potassium was more effective than placebo in reducing migraine headache pain at 2 h after dosing, which was the primary endpoint. Secondary analyses showed that diclofenac-potassium provided significant pain relief from 60 min after dosing and for all remaining endpoints in the 8-h observation period. Both 50 and 100 mg doses of diclofenac-potassium were similarly effective. A similar effect was shown with sumatriptan; however, significant superiority to placebo was seen only from the 90-min time point. Diclofenac-potassium was generally superior to placebo or sumatriptan in reducing accompanying symptoms, particularly nausea. Diclofenac-potassium seemed to be as well tolerated as placebo, with fewer adverse events reported than after sumatriptan treatment and with more patients assessing the overall tolerability of diclofenac-potassium better than that of sumatriptan. Interpretation. Compared with placebo and the reference therapy sumatriptan, diclofenac-potassium is an effective, fast-acting, and well-tolerated acute oral therapy for migraine attacks, with advantages over oral sumatriptan in terms of onset of analgesic effect, reduction of accompanying symptoms, and tolerability profile. It may therefore be useful as an alternative oral therapy for migraine attacks.", "outbound_citations": ["9071263", "8710123", "8634619", "7564725", "8749241", "8536293", "7516861", "7835382", "8495453", "1551795", "1317294", "1947516", "1941010", "3545942"], "inbound_citations": ["35469478", "31551306", "30973200", "30449151", "28580703", "28507605", "27957624", "26839703", "26178694", "25962622", "25963327", "25600718", "25010639", "28360580", "23633348", "23163546", "22336868", "22336784", "21125432", "27713337", "20959428"], "label": "1"}

The power calculation of the study was based on 24-hour headache recurrence, an efficacy measure in the abortive treatment of migraine, and on the occurrence of adverse events.\n\n\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nSubjects, aged between18 and 65 years, with migraine with or without aura but otherwise healthy, were randomized to take orally either almotriptan malate, 12.5 mg, or sumatriptan succinate, 50 mg. The medications were provided in identical-looking capsules to ensure blinding and were taken for the treatment of moderate or severe headache. Efficacy was determined in terms of (1) headache relief-a decrease in pain intensity to mild or no pain; (2) headache freedom-a decrease to no pain; (3) use of rescue medications, allowed after 2 hours; and (4) headache recurrence-moderate or severe pain returning within 24 hours after headache relief at 2 hours. Adverse events were collected for 96 hours after treatment and for safety evaluation, vital signs, blood tests, and electrocardiograms were performed at the screening and exit visits.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-five investigators enrolled 1255 subjects of whom 1173 were treated (591 with almotriptan and 582 with sumatriptan). At 2 hours, almotriptan treatment provided headache relief in 58.0% of the subjects and sumatriptan treatment in 57.3%; headache freedom was provided by the medications in 17.9% and 24.6%, respectively (P =.005). Rescue medications were taken by 36.7% of the subjects in the almotriptan-treated group and by 33.2% in the sumatriptan-treated group; headaches returned to moderate or severe intensity in 27.4% and 24.0%, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 15.2% of the subjects in the almotriptan-treated group and in 19.4% in the sumatriptan-treated group (P =.06); treatment-related adverse events occurred in 9.1% and 15.5% of the subjects, respectively (P =.001), including chest pain, which occurred in 0.3% and 2.2%, respectively (P =.004).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlmotriptan and sumatriptan are similarly effective in the abortive treatment of moderate or severe migraine headache; they are also similarly well tolerated and safe.", "outbound_citations": ["11595000", "11075844", "9665056", "9563208", "8789380"], "inbound_citations": ["34633423", "30845850", "27521843", "27957624"], "label": "1"}

Cortical auditory evoked responses were recorded for 500 msec poststimulus. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan and a 17-lead quantitative EEG were assessed at the same timepoints. Relative to placebo, zolmitriptan reduced the maximum absolute amplitude, amplitude difference (from nontarget tone noise) and area under the curve of the cortical auditory target tone event-related potential (P300 ERP). The most dramatic effect of zolmitriptan was to diminish the point estimate of noise during the 200-400 msec poststimulus epoch. The effect of zolmitriptan appeared concentration dependent. The latency of the P300 ERP was unaffected by zolmitriptan and there was no clinically significant effect on the EEG.

A review of utilization of serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans) in an MCO determined that about 24% of the patients who received triptan therapy exceeded the manufacturers. recommendations regarding the maximum daily dose and safe treatment guidelines in a 30-day period. An initiative was designed to manage the coverage of migraine abortive therapies with the anticipated outcome of decreasing potential misuse or overuse of the medications.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this retrospective, observational study was to determine the impact of a monthly drug-specific milligram coverage maximum (quantity limit) on serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans) and dihydroergotamine (DHE) nasal spray on the utilization and costs of migraine care in an MCO with approximately 600000 covered members.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA longitudinal, retrospective cohort analysis was conducted. All migraine-related services were analyzed, including outpatient medical visits, emergency department utilization, inpatient hospitalizations, and outpatient prescription drug use. The analysis was conducted using medical and pharmacy administrative claims. Analysis of data was performed for the period 12 months prior (October 1999 to September 2000) and 18 months postimplementation of the monthly drug-specific milligram coverage maximum (October 2000 through March 2002).\n\n\nRESULTS\nImposition of a monthly coverage maximum for migraine-abortive therapies was associated with a 26.1% reduction in overall per- patient-per-month (PPPM) medical costs for migraine care, from US dollars 55.52 PPPM to US dollars 41.02 PPPM (P<0.01). Utilization of serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists and DHE nasal spray declined by 16.7%, from 0.18 prescriptions PPPM to 0.15 prescriptions PPPM (P=0.039), and direct drug costs declined by 28.8%, from US dollars 29.18 PPPM to US dollars 20.78 PPPM (P<0.001). Utilization and costs of outpatient and inpatient migraine-related medical services declined by 40% from US dollars 16.58 PPPM in the preperiod to US dollars 9.94 PPPM in the postperiod (P<0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA monthly drug-specific milligram coverage maximum was associated with significant reduction in drug costs and utilization of serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans) and DHE nasal spray. Utilization and costs of migraine-related medical services also declined after implementation of the coverage maximum for triptans and DHE nasal spray.

It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called 'migraine generator'. To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients. A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Increases of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum. Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state. The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such, rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache.", "outbound_citations": ["8895232", "8740608", "8628589", "7585147", "8748587", "7931375", "7912763", "8027764", "8062351", "8014115", "8200785", "8176441", "8132437", "8237217", "1473143", "1399559", "1399563", "1501770", "1553549", "1816375", "1720429", "1716753", "2050758", "1889975", "1863916", "1677194", "2370136", "2182565", "2743414", "2786929", "3652201", "3652205", "3698095"], "inbound_citations": ["36804472", "35093009", "33782592", "33549749", "32845489", "32423331", "30771365", "31142137", "30926119", "28948863", "29174963", "29063211", "28430860", "26751129", "27919795", "28179394", "27870423", "28116293", "27309348", "27242449", "29148687", "26990646", "25366550", "26030417", "25600722", "26638768", "25112542", "25053747", "24671392", "24941668", "24452663", "23996723", "23671252", "23564233", "23475698", "23190076", "23278104", "23354602", "22131304", "23065481", "22939884", "22644179", "12904085", "21375442", "21446025", "21335366", "20384588", "20732744", "20553761", "20958299", "20807909", "20731965", "20227279", "20376601", "20425205"], "label": "0"}

Disposition was studied by administration of a 25 mg capsule, labelled with 100 microCi [14C]-zolmitriptan, to five men and one woman on a single occasion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nZolmitriptan was well tolerated by both i.v. and oral routes. Adverse events were mostly mild, consistent with earlier studies and characteristic of this class of drug. Reports were similar in nature and number after both oral and i.v. dosing. Mean +/- s.d. oral bioavailability was 0.49 +/- 0.24 (0.38 +/- 0.16 in men and 0.60 +/- 0.28 in women). After oral dosing, Cmax and AUC values in women were approximately double those in men. Relative to zolmitriptan concentrations, metabolite concentrations were higher after oral dosing than after i.v., and higher in men compared with women. Half-life was significantly longer after oral dosing (mean 22%, 95% CI 6-35%). Mean +/- s.d. values for CL, V2 and t1/2,z after i.v. dosing (all subjects) were 8.7 +/- 1.7 ml min-1 kg-1, 122 +/- 321 and 2.30 +/- 0.59 h respectively. Following administration of 25 mg [14C]-zolmitriptan, 91.5% of the dose was recovered in 7 days, 64.4 +/- 6.5% in urine and 27.1 +/- 6.0% in faeces. Less than 10% was recovered unchanged in urine, with 31.1 +/- 6.4% recovered as the inactive indole acetic acid metabolite. Most of the faecal material was unchanged zolmitriptan, representing unabsorbed drug. Plasma concentrations of [14C] were slightly higher than those of the summed concentrations of known analytes zolmitriptan, the active N-desmethyl metabolite (183C91), the inactive N-oxide (1652W92) and indole acetic acid (2161W92) metabolites, which accounted for 86% of total plasma radioactivity. No other significant metabolites were detected in plasma. Some minor additional metabolites were detected in urine, none of which contributed more than 5% of the dose.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe data suggest that zolmitriptan undergoes first-pass metabolism and this is more extensive in men than in women. Zolmitriptan has suitable bioavailability for an acute oral migraine treatment and there are no significant unidentified metabolites in man.", "outbound_citations": ["8395298", "1653135", "1665260"], "inbound_citations": ["34096834", "34199479", "34015416", "33208542", "32747623", "28581633", "26189757"], "label": "0"}

However, it is unknown whether desensitization plays a role in headache improvement.

For this purpose, we studied 24 healthy control subjects and 36 patients suffering from migraine with interparoxysmal headache refractory to conventional therapies. Patients showed baseline serum beta-endorphin levels significantly lower than healthy control subjects and treatment with histamine for 15 days increased their beta-endorphin concentrations.

Its primary route of metabolism is via monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A). Antidepressants such as the MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide may be used in patients with chronic headache syndromes. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the interactions between rizatriptan and moclobemide.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over study 12 healthy, young volunteers (six males, six females) were treated with moclobemide (150 mg twice daily) or placebo for 4 days. On the fourth day, a single dose of rizatriptan (10 mg) was administered, and subsequently blood and urine samples were collected for assay of rizatripan and N-monodesmethyl rizatriptan. Plasma concentrates of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), a marker of MAO-A inhibition, were also assessed. Supine and standing blood pressure were measured regularly.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth treatments were well tolerated. During moclobemide, the increase in supine diastolic blood pressure following rizatriptan administration was augmented. Inhibition of MAO by moclobemide was inferred from a persistent decrease in DHPG level (43% on average). When rizatriptan was coadministered with moclobemide, the area under the plasma drug concentration-time profiles for rizatriptan and its N-monodesmethyl metabolite increased 2.2-fold (90% CI, 1.93-2.47) and 5.3-fold (90% CI, 4.81-5.91), respectively, when compared with placebo. Peak plasma drug concentrations for rizatriptan and its n-monodesmethyl metabolite increased 1.4-fold (90% CI, 1.11-1.80) and 2.6-fold (90% CI, 2.23-3.14), respectively, and half-lives of both were prolonged.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMoclobemide inhibited the metabolism of rizatriptan and its active N-monodesmethyl metabolite through inhibition of MAO-A. Thus, moclobemide may considerably potentiate rizatriptan action. Concurrent administration of moclobemide and rizatriptan is not recommended.", "outbound_citations": ["9399014", "9056052", "8900521", "8838441", "8755236", "8582117", "7783861", "7782482", "7519866", "8161354", "8313402", "2037157", "1646924", "2673623", "2469451", "2450251", "3162952", "10.1016/0006-2952(94)90397-2", "1347659", "PMC1379786", "PMC1364898", "8857072"], "inbound_citations": ["35648190", "34637840", "27084892"], "label": "0"}

In a multinational double-blind randomized parallel-groups dose-finding trial, alniditan was given subcutaneously in hospital to patients with migraine headache of moderate or severe intensity at doses of 0.8 mg (n = 44), 1.0 mg (n = 42), 1.2 mg (n=46) and 1.4 mg (n=39). Efficacy, tolerability and safety of each dose were compared with those of placebo (n =41 ). At 2 h after injection, headache was absent or mild in 83% and 82% of patients receiving alniditan 1.2 and 1.4 mg respectively compared with 39% for placebo (p0.002). Complete relief from headache was achieved in 72% (1.4 mg) Time to onset of relief decreased with increasing alniditan dose, and there was a dose-dependent reduction in headache recurrence rate: 25% of patients receiving 1.4 mg had responded by 15 min and headache recurred within 24 h in only 16% of the patients who initially responded to alniditan 1.4 mg, significantly less than for placebo (p=0.018). Alniditan was superior to placebo in reducing the associated symptoms of nausea, phonophobia and photophobia, and in increasing patients' functional ability. The use of rescue medication was reduced when compared with placebo, and up to 87% of patients said that they would use the drug again if available. No clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were seen, nor consistent changes in clinical laboratory findings. Adverse effects, mainly head pressure, paraesthesia, and hot flushes, were reported by 34% of placebo-treated patients and up to 70% of patients receiving alniditan, but all doses were very well tolerated and no clear relationship with dose was established. Comparison with published findings suggests that alniditan 1.4 mg sc may have advantages over sumatriptan 6 mg sc in providing complete relief from acute migraine headache, and may be associated with fewer headache recurrences within 24h. Both of these suggestions warrant further and larger trials of alniditan in acute migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["8536293", "7551126", "7697699", "7516861", "8262783", "8393474", "8395342", "1379152", "1647495", "1851894", "1653140"], "inbound_citations": ["28179394", "22129843", "21631491"], "label": "0"}

This study was the first US trial to evaluate the effects of sumatriptan nasal spray administered for multiple migraine attacks.\n\n\nDESIGN/INTERVENTIONS\nSumatriptan nasal spray (5, 10, or 20 mg) was administered via a 1-shot nasal applicator into either nostril for up to 3 migraine attacks occurring over 6 months in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study.\n\n\nSETTING\nFifty-six outpatient clinical centers in the United States.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nA total of 1086 men and women diagnosed with migraine with or without aura per International Headache Society criteria.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPercentage of patients with headache relief (moderate or severe predose pain reduced to mild or none); percentage of patients with no or mild (vs moderate or severe) clinical disability; percentage of patients with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia; adverse events; clinical laboratory test results.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAcross attacks, headache relief in the 20-, 10-, and 5-mg drug and placebo groups was experienced 120 minutes postdose by 60%, 54%, 44%, and 32% of patients, respectively (P<.05 for each sumatriptan nasal spray group vs placebo, for the 10-mg vs 5-mg drug group, and for the 20-mg vs 5-mg drug group). Two thirds of the 20-mg patients treating 3 attacks experienced relief at 2 hours postdose for at least 2 of 3 attacks. Clinical disability scores at 120 minutes in the 20-, 10-, and 5-mg drug and placebo groups reflected no or mild impairment in 70%, 67%, 57%, and 50% of patients, respectively (P<.05 for the 10- or 20-mg drug group vs placebo group, and for the 20-mg vs 5- mg drug group). Similar efficacy rates were observed for nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. For all parameters, individual-attack efficacy rates did not differ from across-attack rates. The incidence of adverse events was not dose related. The most frequently reported adverse event in the active treatment groups was taste disturbance (bad, bitter, or unpleasant).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSumatriptan hemisulfate nasal spray (5, 10, or 20 mg) is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of multiple migraine attacks. The 20-mg dose was associated with the highest efficacy rates across the greatest number of parameters.", "outbound_citations": ["7964913", "7644079", "7644080", "7644082", "7987510", "8200027", "1379152", "1851894", "1653135"], "inbound_citations": ["31446449", "30877622", "28942578", "27957624", "27078039", "27063965"], "label": "1"}

Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be acutely exacerbated by administration of certain serotonin agonists Exacerbation of OCD symptoms by sumatriptan, a 5HT1D agonist (Zohar, 1993), is consistent with pre-clinical data suggesting that the serotonin auto-receptor plays an important role in this disorder (El Mansari et al, 1995). 2. In order to investigate the functional role of the serotonin auto-receptor in OCD, the authors undertook single photon emission computed tomography in OCD patients after administration of sumatriptan and placebo. The authors hypothesized that, as in the case of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) challenge (Hollander et al, 1995), exacerbation of OCD symptoms would be accompanied by increased cortical metabolism and thus blood flow, and more specifically by increased activity in the orbitofrontal-striatal circuit. They also expected, that as in the case of mCPP challenge (Hollander et al, 1993), exacerbation of OCD symptoms would be associated with a relatively poor response to subsequent treatment with serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors. 3. Sumatriptan (100 mg orally) and placebo were administered on separate days to 14 patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for OCD, using a randomized double-blind design. After 90 minutes, patients were injected with Tc-99m HMPAO and underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain. Activity in regions of interest was calculated, and compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Patients were subsequently treated with a serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). 4. Behavioral response to sumatriptan was heterogenous, with 4 patients showing acute exacerbation, and 4 patients demonstrating a decrease in symptoms. On sumatriptan challenge, there was a significant association between symptom exacerbation and decreased activity in frontal areas. There was an association between decreased activity in an inferior frontal area with worse response to treatment, and also patients with symptom exacerbation after sumatriptan had poorer response to SSRI treatment. 5. Heterogeneity of behavioral response to sumatriptan in OCD is consistent with previous studies demonstrating conflicting and heterogenous behavioral responses to serotonergic challenges (Hollander et al, 1992), and with underlying heterogeneity in the neurobiology of this disorder. 6. It may be hypothesized that increased frontal activity in some patients with OCD is itself a compensatory mechanism. In patients with such compensatory hyperactivity, administration of a serotonin auto-receptor agonist results in decreased frontal activity and exacerbation of OCD symptoms. These patients may also be less likely to respond to treatment with a SSRI. 7. Further work combining pharmacological challenge paradigms and functional imaging techniques in OCD may be helpful in elucidating the neurobiology of this complex disorder.", "outbound_citations": ["8890694", "8660126", "8660129", "8597523", "7578657", "7726720", "7726719", "7622800", "7811162", "8555752", "7524463", "8077163", "8077177", "24591194", "8279930", "8044031", "8272450", "8389009", "8353170", "8390743", "8420593", "1514873", "1514879", "1514872", "1532132", "1728249", "2036127", "2017519", "2203327", "2294853", "2199433", "2686576", "2684084", "2668393", "2912267", "3264144", "3048425", "3414851", "3337615", "3276283", "3675134", "3331632", "3036259"], "inbound_citations": ["34400778", "31927606", "30721232", "32166143", "26683174", "23377022", "23325368", "21925243", "21920503", "20816027"], "label": "0"}

Cephalic large arteries are dilated during migraine headache as well as during NTG headache. N-acetylcysteine enhances the formation of NO and potentiates NTG-induced headache, whereas mepyramine, a H1-antagonist capable of blocking histamine-induced headache, has no effect. Thus, the headache is dependent on NO or other steps in the NO cascade. The model is useful for pharmacological interventions and sumatriptan reduced the NTG-induced headache.

Patients took SC sumatriptan for one attack and DHE nasal spray for the other in random order. Data from both treatment periods show that at all time points from 15 minutes, SC sumatriptan was significantly better than DHE nasal spray at providing both headache relief (moderate/severe headache improving to mild/none) and resolution of headache. Similarly, SC sumatriptan was superior to DHE nasal spray for the other efficacy end points assessed in the study. Patients reported that both treatments were well tolerated. Adverse events were reported by 43% of patients taking SC sumatriptan and 22% of patients taking DHE nasal spray. These were usually mild and transient. We conclude that subcutaneous sumatriptan has a faster onset of action than DHE nasal spray and provides greater relief of acute migraine symptoms.

There is a paucity of clinical trial evidence on the treatment of this problem. While there is some evidence of involvement of the serotonin (5\u2010HT2) receptor subtype in this phenomenon, other serotonergic receptor systems are not well studied. In this trial, 35 patients on maintenance therapy with a variety of serotonergic antidepressants, who reported antidepressant induced sexual dysfunction, were enrolled. Patients were given both granisetron 1 mg, and sumatriptan 100 mg, in a crossover design, to be used 1 h before intercourse. Sexual dysfunction was measured using the Feiger scale. There was a high dropout rate in the trial, reflecting both embarrassment with the pharmacological treatment of sexual dysfunction and difficulties with planning and timing the medication. Nevertheless, there was a significant effect of granisetron in this study, with scores decreasing from 23.7 (SD 2.52) to 16.0 (SD 6.42) on the Feiger scale (n = 14, P = 0.001, Wilcoxon sign rank test). Sumatriptan failed to show a significant change from baseline at the 0.01 level of significance. While the small sample size, high dropout rates and open label design are limitations to this study, it suggests efficacy of the granisetron in antidepressant induced sexual dysfunction and the role of the 5\u2010HT3 receptor in this phenomenon.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33843553", "28984491", "28414050", "26301289", "23728643"], "label": "0"}

METHODOLOGY: To identify and evaluate all pharmacologic interventions for MIH, we conducted a qualitative systematic review of the English-language literature from 1966 to June 1998 using MEDLINE. The following search terms were used: chronic daily headache, transformed migraine, analgesic withdrawal headache, analgesic rebound headache, drug-associated headache, medication-induced headache, detoxification, and dihydroergotamine. In addition, a review of the references from relevant literature was also conducted to collect reports not identified in the MEDLINE search. RESULTS: Numerous therapies for acute management of MIH have been evaluated, although no rigorously conducted clinical trials were identified. Therapies evaluated include abrupt withdrawal of analgesics, initiation of dihydroergotamine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, methylergonovine, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan, amitriptyline, dexamethasone, piracetam, prothipendyl, and valproate. Epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical features, pathophysiology, and long-term prognosis of therapy are discussed and therapeutic guidelines are offered. CONCLUSIONS: MIH is an underrecognized and difficult condition affecting headache-prone patients. The published literature concerning treatment of patients with MIH is scant and of poor quality, making it difficult for clinicians to decide on appropriate therapy. Recognition and treatment of MIH may lead to a long-term improvement in headache relief for many patients. It appears that complete withdrawal of the medications being overused is required for favorable long-term results.", "outbound_citations": ["9549429", "9505003", "9058404", "9403363", "8933992", "8857711", "8783476", "8710100", "8734771", "8666530", "8530278", "7495500", "7843958", "7843954", "8002320", "7828198", "8166817", "8132436", "8313455", "8376101", "8500154", "1483819", "1446987", "1446990", "1372884", "1353713", "1675320", "1646775", "2030076", "2272811", "2262317", "2228599", "2370132", "2793455", "3068202", "3282670", "3343127", "3048700", "3117735", "3298163", "3570762", "3530622", "3520384", "3941762", "7159921", "7085263", "7055014", "7309503", "6286133", "15645831", "4852779", "4720472", "18139712"], "inbound_citations": ["36855934", "31522548", "29273610", "28444948", "24862255", "24293089", "23517110", "23925669", "22868543", "21700646", "20360117", "19614708"], "label": "0"}

METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive search for reports of serotonin syndrome associated with sumatriptan use was conducted by using tertiary drug interaction literature, MEDLINE, EmBASE, Biological Abstracts, Current Contents, Reactions, ClinAlert, and the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. In addition, related reports from the proprietary manufacturers, the Health Protection Branch of Health Canada, and the World Health Organization Collaborative Centre for International Drug Monitoring were also solicited. RESULTS The concurrent use of sumatriptan with an SSRI or lithium has been reported to cause symptoms suggestive of serotonin syndrome in 16 and 2 cases, respectively. There were no reports involving MAOIs. In general, the reports indicated a mild-to-moderate, self-limited course with some features consistent with the serotonin syndrome. We found published reports of sumatriptan use without adverse events involving 148 patients receiving SSRIs, 31 patients taking MAOIs, and a small number using lithium. CONCLUSIONS Clinical evidence supporting the strict contraindication of MAOIs, SSRIs, and lithium was not identified. The balance of documented clinical experience pertaining to the use of sumatriptan concurrently with SSRIs or lithium suggests that most patients tolerate this combination without incident. Because there is little reliable experience with sumatriptan in combination with MAOIs, we suggest that sumatriptan should continue to be avoided in patients taking these agents until further data demonstrating safety become available. OBJETIVO Determinar el riego de desarrollar el s\u00edndrome de la serotonina asociado al uso concomitante del sumatriptan con agentes inhibidores selectivos de la captura de la serotonina, inhibidores de la monoamina oxidasa (IMAO), y el litio. M\u00c9TODOS Las fuentes de informaci\u00f3n incluyeron la literatura de interacciones medicamentosas, MEDLINE, EmBASE, Biological Abstracts, Current Contents, Reactions, ClinAlert, y International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. Tambi\u00e9n reportes emanados por los fabricantes de estos medicamentos, la Rama de Protecci\u00f3n de la Salud de Salud Canada, y el Centro Colaborativo de Monitoreo Internacional de Medicamentos de la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud. RESULTADOS Los resultados de la investigaci\u00f3n sugieren la presencia del s\u00edndrome de la serotonina en 16 casos de pacientes que recibieron el sumatriptan con los inhibidores selectivos de la captura de la serotonina y en 2 casos de pacientes que recibieron el sumatriptan con el litio. No hubo reportes que involucrasen a los IMAO. Las manifestaciones cl\u00ednicas de este s\u00edndrome est\u00e1n descritas en este art\u00edculo. En general, los reportes indican que el curso de este evento es de leve a moderado y auto limitante. Los autores consiguieron un n\u00famero considerable de reportes de estas combinaciones que no condujeron a reacciones adversas. Estos incluyeron 148 reportes del uso del sumatriptan con inhibidores selectivos de la captura de la serotonina, 31 del uso del sumatriptan con IMAO, y un n\u00famero peque\u00f1o del uso del sumatriptan con el litio. CONCLUSIONES No existe suficiente evidencia cl\u00ednica de que los IMAO, los inhibidores selectivos de la captura de la serotonina o que el litio est\u00e9n totalmente contraindicados en pacientes recibiendo el sumatriptan. La experiencia cl\u00ednica documentada hasta el presente sugiere que la mayor\u00eda de los pacientes toleran esta combinaci\u00f3n sin incidentes. Debido a que existe poca experiencia acerca del uso del sumatriptan con los IMAO, los autores sugieren que esta combinaci\u00f3n sea evitada hasta que haya mayor informaci\u00f3n sobre su seguridad. OBJECTIF Pr\u00e9ciser le risque d'apparition d'un syndrome s\u00e9rotoninergique li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi concomitant de sumatriptan et des inhibiteurs de la monoamine oxydase (IMAO), des inhibiteurs s\u00e9lectifs de la recapture de la s\u00e9rotonine (ISRS), ou du lithium. M\u00c9THODES Une recherche des rapports publi\u00e9s sur le syndrome s\u00e9rotoninergique li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi du sumatriptan a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e dans les sources d'informations sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es en interactions m\u00e9dicamenteuses, dans les banques informatis\u00e9es MEDLINE et EmBASE, dans les revues Biological Abstracts, Current Contents, Reactions, ClinAlert, et International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. De plus, les donn\u00e9es des fabricants, de la Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Protection de la Sant\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 Canada, et du Centre de Collaboration pour la Surveillance Internationale des M\u00e9dicaments de l'Organisation Mondiale de la Sant\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9vis\u00e9es. R\u00c9SULTATS L'emploi concomitant de sumatriptan et des ISRS ou du lithium a \u00e9t\u00e9 associ\u00e9 \u00e0 des sympt\u00f4mes s'apparentant au syndrome s\u00e9rotoninergique dans 16 et 2 cas, respectivement. Il n'y a pas eu de cas rapport\u00e9 avec les IMAO. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les sympt\u00f4mes rapport\u00e9s \u00e9taient de l\u00e9gers \u00e0 mod\u00e9r\u00e9s, et quelques pr\u00e9sentations concordaient avec un syndrome s\u00e9rotoninergique. Les auteurs ont r\u00e9pertori\u00e9 148 patients ayant utilis\u00e9 le sumatriptan et les ISRS qui n'ont eu aucun probl\u00e8me, 31 patients ayant eu des IMAO et quelquesuns ayant eu du lithium. CONCLUSIONS L'\u00e9vidence clinique supportant une contre-indication absolue de l'emploi des IMAO, des ISRS, ou du lithium concomitamment \u00e0 celle du sumatriptan n'a pu \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9e. La plupart des patients tol\u00e8rent les associations sumatriptan et ISRS ou lithium sans incident. Comme il y a peu d'informations entourant l'utilisation concomitante du sumatriptan et des IMAO, les auteurs sugg\u00e8rent qu'il serait prudent d'\u00e9viter cette association jusqu'\u00e0 ce que des donn\u00e9es suppl\u00e9mentaires montrent son inocuit\u00e9.", "outbound_citations": ["8701373", "8869767", "8762094", "8740336", "8632339", "7591744", "7576268", "7783861", "7782482", "7609860", "7649972", "7836342", "7928322", "8161354", "7928325", "2035713", "2393343", "2798702", "3275471"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

In this study patients with episodic cluster headache fulfilling the criteria of the International Headache Society were examined during an acute spontaneous attack of headache to determine the local cranial release of neuropeptides. Blood was sampled from the external jugular vein ipsilateral to the pain before and after treatment of the attack. Samples were assayed for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), substance P and neuropeptide Y. Attacks were treated with either oxygen inhalation, sumatriptan or an opiate. Thirteen patients were studied of whom 10 were male and three female. All had well-established typical attacks of cluster headache when blood was sampled. During the attacks external jugular vein blood levels of CGRP and VIP were raised while there was no change in neuropeptide Y or substance P. Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels rose to 110 +/- 7 pmol/l (normal: < 40) while VIP levels rose to 20 +/- 3 pmol/l (normal: < 7). Treatment with both oxygen and subcutaneous sumatriptan reduced the CGRP level to normal, while opiate administration did not alter the peptide levels. These data demonstrate for the first time in vivo human evidence for activation of the trigeminovascular system and the cranial parasympathetic nervous system in an acute attack of cluster headache.

Many novel antimigraine compounds are in clinical development, yet full characterization of each one's pharmacodynamic behavior is a formidable task due to the difficulty in studying a migraineur during an attack. Nitroglycerin (NTG) administration commonly causes a headache with some features similar to those of a migraine. As such, NTG has been used as a model of vascular headaches, including migraine. The pharmacodynamic effects of nitroglycerin and sumatriptan on middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv) and headache scores were studied in 10 healthy male volunteers. An intravenous infusion of NTG titrated to 0.5 mcg/kg/min over 30 minutes resulted in a median reduction from baseline in MCAv of 27% (range: 16.4%\u201037.3%). Nine of the subjects developed a headache with a median verbal score of 3.5 of 10 (range: 0\u20135). Subjects received sumatriptan either 2 mg intravenously or 6 mg subcutaneously, which abated clinical headache in 9 of the 10 subjects (p = 0.030). A median sumatriptan\u2010induced increase in MCAv of 21% (p = 0.054) suggested a constricting effect on the NTG\u2010induced dilated MCA. A two\u2010compartment pharmacokinetic/indirect\u2010effects pharmacodynamic model was fit to the sumatriptan concentration and MCAv data using iterative two\u2010stage analysis. This model was unbiased and fit the concentration (r2 = 0.98) and the MCAv (r2 = 0.79) data well. These results suggest that NTG\u2010induced headache and the development of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models could serve as a useful method for exploring the mechanisms of abortive migraine drugs.", "outbound_citations": ["8902249", "8823238", "7848120", "7535192", "7955802", "8008226", "7538702", "7911231", "7912237", "7516861", "7907324", "8389008", "8517693", "8385160", "8436495", "1446988", "1576743", "1349944", "1315562", "1563945", "1774175", "1676084", "1860130", "2006623", "2186015", "2186016", "2512693", "2506503", "3131041", "3114637", "3113764", "3925750", "6745083", "6791420", "13306345", "13121092"], "inbound_citations": ["36974065", "33099721", "32516986", "30771365", "30501556", "23671251", "19740120", "20173638"], "label": "0"}

ECG variables, PR, QRS, QT interval, and QT dispersion, were measured. QT intervals were adjusted for heart rate using Bazett's formula. None of the doses of almotriptan differed significantly from placebo with respect to PR, QRS, or QTc intervals, QTc dispersion, heart rate, or continuous ECG monitoring. Almotriptan 12.5 mg did not differ significantly from placebo with respect to systolic or diastolic blood pressure, but almotriptan 25 and 50 mg raised systolic blood pressure by a mean of 2.78 and 4.17 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure by 3.77 and 6.11 mm Hg, respectively, during 0 to 4 h after dosing. Thus none of the doses of almotriptan affected the ECG, and the 12.5-mg dose (the expected therapeutic dose) had no hemodynamic effects.

The zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet was also significantly more effective than placebo for 1-, 2- and 4-h pain-free response (8% vs. 3%, P =0.0207, 27% vs. 7%, P < 0.0001, and 37% vs. 11%, P < 0.0001, respectively). Of those patients stating a preference, 70% of patients preferred the orally disintegrating tablet to a conventional tablet.

In the previous year, 89% of those patients reported visiting a clinic, 23% reported visiting an emergency room and 5% reported being hospitalized for migraine. Patients reported an average of 6.5 days absent from work, 44 days working with migraine headache and 10.4 reduced workday equivalents due to ineffectiveness at work with migraine. Based on data obtained from the Ontario, the average overall annual cost due to migraine was estimated to be 3,025 dollars/patient; most of this (87%) due to indirect costs.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn Canada, patients with moderate to severe migraine, as identified in a phase III clinical trial, reported lost work days and reduced effectiveness while at work, as well as increased health care resource utilization due to migraine.

In a fifth period, subjects received 4 mg intravenous (i.v.) rizatriptan as a reference.

Patients who had previously participated in placebo-controlled zolmitriptan studies were recruited. A total of 2058 patients treated 31,579 migraine attacks (average 15 per patient), for up to 1 year. Twenty-six percent of attacks treated with a single zolmitriptan 5-mg dose were associated with at least one adverse event (24% treated with two doses). The most frequent adverse events included asthenia (14% of patients), nausea (12%), somnolence (10%), dizziness (11%), and paresthesia (11%). The rank order of the most common adverse events was not influenced by sex, age, or number of zolmitriptan doses taken and was similar between attacks 1 and 45. The majority of adverse events (59%) occurred within 2 hours of dosing, were of either mild (59%) or moderate (35%) intensity, of 4 hours' duration or less (67%), and required no further action (94%). Following an initial 5-mg dose of zolmitriptan, the 2-hour headache response rate (reduction in headache pain from moderate or severe before treatment to mild or no pain at 2 hours posttreatment) was 81% in patients treating moderate and severe attacks (19,639 of 24,161). Patients were pain-free at 2 hours in 55% of all attacks (16,510 of 29,808). The efficacy of zolmitriptan was not influenced by age, sex, weight, use of prophylactic antimigraine medication, or association of attacks with menstruation. Analysis of the overall population and a subgroup who treated 30 or more migraine attacks showed that zolmitriptan was consistently effective across attacks. Overall, 67% of patients who treated five or more attacks reported zolmitriptan to be effective in 80% to 100% of attacks. Zolmitriptan produced meaningful migraine relief and improvement in normal activity impairment in 73% and 78% of moderate and severe attacks, respectively. Patients treated recurrence of moderate or severe headache with a second zolmitriptan dose in 32% of attacks which responded to the first dose within 2 hours. Where required, a second zolmitriptan 5-mg dose for treatment of recurrence produced a headache response rate of 90% at 2 hours postdose. Thus, zolmitriptan 5 mg (plus an optional second 5-mg dose for treatment of recurrence) is well tolerated and effective in the acute treatment of multiple migraine attacks over periods up to 1 year.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33208542", "32093628", "29212383"], "label": "1"}

With 835 patients in its intention-to-treat efficacy analysis, DISC compared a stratified care strategy, where initial therapy was based on clinical need as determined by the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and two stepped care strategies (across attacks and within attacks), where first-line therapy with a simple combination analgesic was escalated, if response had been inadequate, to zolmitriptan, a migraine-specific therapy.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo report on the cost effectiveness of these three strategies from a societal perspective.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS\nA cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using data from the DISC study, and including both health service and productivity costs. Data were collected prospectively on drug usage (main therapy and rescue medication); resource use associated with adverse events was estimated by a clinician blinded to treatment strategy. Health service resource use was costed using UK unit costs (1999 to 2000 values). Data were collected using diary cards on the amount of time patients lost from work, and on reduced effectiveness at work, due to a migraine attack. This facilitated an estimate of the productivity costs associated with the treatment strategies. To assess cost effectiveness, the differences in costs between the strategies were related to the two primary outcome measures in the trial: headache response 2 hours after initial therapy and disability-adjusted time during the first 4 hours after initial therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough the mean health service cost was higher in the stratified care group (mean over 6 attacks of pound 28.25 versus pound 11.74 and pound 23.15 in the stepped care across attacks group and within attacks group, respectively), mean productivity costs over 6 attacks were lower in the stratified group (pound 112.22 versus pound 144.70 and pound 127.53). The total mean cost over six attacks was, therefore, lowest in the stratified care group (pound 138.95 compared with pound 157.19 in the stepped care across attacks group and pound 148.53 in the stepped care within attacks group), although these differences did not reach statistical significance. In terms of headache response, stratified care was statistically significantly more effective than both forms of stepped care. Using disability-adjusted time, stratified care was statistically significantly more effective than stepped care across attacks, but not against stepped care within attacks.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGiven its lower mean costs and higher mean effectiveness, a stratified care strategy, which included zolmitriptan, was the dominant strategy and was unequivocally more cost effective from a societal perspective than either stepped care strategy. When the uncertainty around these means was considered, stratified care had the highest probability of being cost effective.", "outbound_citations": ["11086366", "11596834", "10131756", "10496257", "10214536", "9829155", "11747057", "10165464", "9353652", "10448202", "9399017", "9145054", "7827647", "11130524", "11098098", "9732339", "9793711", "10348420", "10537899"], "inbound_citations": ["34057676", "29235068"], "label": "1"}

Patients rated head pain, functional ability, nausea, and vomiting at baseline and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours after the injection. Presence or absence of headache at 3 hours was calculated from collected data.

Over the past few years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved six new abortive pharmacologic therapies, with several others in various stages of clinical trials. Unfortunately, concurrent pharmacologic changes in headache prophylaxis have not kept pace with their abortive counterparts. However, divalproex sodium (Depakote), which is approved by the FDA as a migraine prophylactic agent, is the first in the anticonvulsant class of medication for migraine headache and has expanded the options in headache treatment. The objective of this retrospective multicenter study of 284 patients with migraine or cluster headaches was to examine the clinical efficacy and safety of divalproex sodium as prophylaxis in monotherapy and in polytherapy. Sixty-one percent of migraineurs and 73% of cluster patients noted a decrease in pain with divalproex sodium and continued that therapy for more than 3 months. Reported negative side effects included weight gain, nausea, somnolence, tremor, alopecia, dysequilibrium, and rash. However, only 14% of subjects discontinued therapy due to these side effects. Overall, divalproex sodium was found to be an effective and generally well-tolerated prophylactic treatment option as monotherapy or in polytherapy for migraine and cluster headache.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35222013", "34919214", "30704679", "29493566", "27310148", "26635477", "24494792", "24090529", "23889923", "23330402", "23024564", "22382758", "12904085", "22009127", "21284609", "20569084", "20352587", "20298131"], "label": "0"}

DATA SOURCE: A MEDLINE search was used to identify pertinent literature published in English including review articles, case reports, letters, and abstracts. Information was also extracted from textbooks for background purposes. STUDY SELECTION: All clinical studies, case reports, abstracts, and letters were included because of the limited amount of literature available on the pharmacologic therapy for PDPH. Related research articles and review articles were also used to provide background information on PDPH. DATA EXTRACTION: Methodology and results from clinical trials and abstracts were described and evaluated. Case reports and letters were summarized and critically reviewed for the feasibility of the different treatment modalities. Information on the pathophysiology, incidence and severity, and clinical presentation of PDPH was extracted from related research articles, review articles, and textbooks. DATA SYNTHESIS: The epidural blood patch (EBP) is one of the most effective treatments for PDPH. Pharmacologic management of PDPH offers a less invasive treatment modality than the EBP. Numerous drug therapies have been presented in the literature, though few merit clinical application. Caffeine therapy, both oral and parenteral, is the most commonly used pharmacologic treatment modality. Theophylline and sumatriptan are potentially promising agents for the treatment of PDPH. Epidural administration of fluids and drugs is also effective in the treatment of PDPH. Epidural administration of NaCl 0.9% and dextran may be an alternative to the EBP when the EBP is unsuccessful or contraindicated. Epidural adrenocorticotropic hormone and epidural morphine also demonstrate some potential in the treatment of PDPH. Individual patient characteristics (i.e., HIV, sepsis) need to be considered when deciding on a treatment. More reports, especially clinical studies, are necessary before a definitive statement can be made regarding any one treatment. In the meantime, therapy will be guided by clinical judgment based on the literature reviewed in this article. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous and oral caffeine are effective and noninvasive treatments for PDPH. Epidural NaCl 0.9% or dextran are alternatives when the EBP is unsuccessful or contraindicated. Several methods of pharmacologic management have been cited in the literature, but all require further evaluation.", "outbound_citations": ["7992906", "7946882", "8010433", "8130064", "17972829", "8239110", "7505608", "7505607", "8496063", "1599116", "1575331", "1575342", "1767918", "1676084", "2278354", "2208553", "2361347", "2335473", "2405733", "2693404", "2912297", "2486648", "2709124", "2486588", "2484880", "3187769", "3369719", "3826597", "3494649", "3767026", "3954102", "3717650", "6567116", "6205150", "6859506", "20894436", "7137614", "360356", "4472385", "5045552", "5106255", "6067279", "13879672", "13841201", "13318967", "15402031"], "inbound_citations": ["34186265", "33740358", "29572284", "28079587", "23197257"], "label": "0"}

This article assumes a broader perspective and compares the clinical, economic, and humanistic attributes of two antimigraine medications, dihydroergotamine (DHE) and sumatriptan, based on a literature review. DHE is an established product with over 40 years of use in the treatment of migraine. Sumatriptan is a new product with a higher acquisition cost than DHE. Because sumatriptan costs more than DHE, the question must be asked. \"Does sumatriptan provide advantages that offset this price differential?\" This question reflects the growing concern among payers and patients over the cost and effectiveness of therapies. However, it is not easily answered. Direct comparative data are not available, and data sources are different for the two products. Moreover, the products are currently marketed in different dosage forms--intramuscular for DHE and subcutaneous for sumatriptan. The literature reviewed indicates that the clinical attributes of the two products are similar, with each having slightly different advantages and disadvantages. However, the DHE literature is generally limited to uncontrolled studies, whereas the sumatriptan literature reports the results of rigorously designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Published data on the products' economic and humanistic attributes are limited. We concluded that the literature does provide important, albeit limited, data on the economic, clinical, and humanistic attributes of DHE and sumatriptan that permit restricted comparisons. The limitations of the data highlight the need for comparative studies of these products' multidimensional attributes both in controlled clinical trials and under actual practice conditions.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10166407", "10160470"], "label": "0"}

More sumatriptan-treated patients were completely pain free compared with placebo-treated patients at both 2 h (24% versus 12%) and 4 h (48% versus 18). Patients receiving sumatriptan reported earlier onset of headache relief than patients receiving placebo. Headache relief in sumatriptan-treated patients was similar, irrespective of the type of migraine (with or without aura) or the time of treatment < or = 4 h or > 4 h after onset of migraine). Sumatriptan was more effective than placebo at relieving nausea, vomiting and photophobia/phonophobia. Few patients were evaluable for treatment of headache recurrence, and statistical analysis was not possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "outbound_citations": ["1317294", "1647495", "1851894", "1653142", "1653138", "3282670", "1653137", "3048700"], "inbound_citations": ["34633423", "27521843", "28400708", "27957624"], "label": "1"}

Back pain is common during pregnancy, but epidural analgesia during labor does not increase the incidence of long-term back pain. Chemical backache caused by 2-chloroprocaine is probably a result of hypocalcemic tetany of paraspinous muscles. The mechanism is presumed to be chelation of calcium by sodium bisulfite, an antioxidant present in nesacaine-MPF. PDPH after dural puncture is caused by leakage of CSF, which causes cerebral hypotension. Cerebral hypotension leads to traction on pain-sensitive intracranial structures and cerebral vasodilation. Initial therapy includes hydration, caffeine, and sumatriptan. EBP is the most effective treatment in severe PDPH. If the first EBP fails, a second blood patch can be performed. Neurologic deficits after regional anesthesia are rare. Meticulous technique and vigilance are the keystones in avoiding major neurologic complications of regional anesthesia. Rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential to optimize a successful outcome if complications do develop.", "outbound_citations": ["3517473", "11756618", "11685003", "11605932", "11517144", "11251431", "11159240", "11213000", "10935019", "10925937", "10648335", "10638928", "10443628", "9952151", "9743399", "9818115", "9793660", "9637641", "9421542", "15321239", "9316950", "9349072", "9141947", "9150769", "9150770", "9052305", "9052306", "9135320", "9338904", "9089859", "8826568", "8669677", "8646094", "9010949", "7486096", "7496283", "8848884", "15636995", "7572008", "8010433", "8042807", "8130064", "7894755", "8123389", "8518569", "8141862", "1419456", "8323897", "1419451", "1928779", "1824671", "2035866", "1994754", "1990900", "1984371", "2143425", "2354090", "2405733", "2912297", "2525887", "2655500", "3179154", "3414352", "3767026", "3521804", "7131074", "7396157", "466549", "5534630", "13318967"], "inbound_citations": ["35428638", "28079587", "25007698", "24009943", "22569780", "22557741", "21334515", "22915876", "20716077", "20628255", "20659606"], "label": "0"}

Migraine is a common disorder with a serious impact on quality of life. Newer serotonin-receptor agonists have been developed with the aim of improving pharmacokinetic characteristics. Almotriptan, a selective agonist of serotonin receptors 1B and 1D, carries FDA-approved labeling for use in the management of migraine with or without aura in adults. The efficacy and receptor affinity resemble those of sumatriptan, but almotriptan has a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile. It has a rapid onset of action, an oral bioavailability of 70-80%, and a longer half-life than sumatriptan. In clinical trials, almotriptan has been significantly more effective than placebo and as effective as sumatriptan. However, it has been associated with better tolerability and greater patient satisfaction. In clinical trials, the most commonly reported adverse effects were nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, vomiting, and paresthesia. Almotriptan is contraindicated in patients with known ischemic heart disease, coronary vasospasm, and other significant cardiovascular disorders. Almotriptan has a lower acquisition cost than other triptans and possibly lower overall health care costs because of a lower frequency of cardiovascular adverse effects. The recommended dose of almotriptan is one 6.25- or 12.5-mg tablet given at the onset of symptoms. Almotriptan is effective for the management of migraine and offers the potential for fewer adverse effects than other agents in its class.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36627414"], "label": "1"}

This randomised, double-blind-to-dose, parallel-group, multicentre study was designed as a two-phase, crossover trial with a total duration of 1 year. In the pre-crossover phase, 1,093 patients aged 18-65 years with an established diagnosis of migraine with or without aura received intranasal zolmitriptan 5, 2.5, 1 or 0.5mg for the treatment of mild, moderate or severe migraine attacks. When a headache persisted or recurred, a second dose of zolmitriptan nasal spray (or other approved escape medication) was permitted 2 hours post-administration but no later than 24 hours after the first dose. In the post-crossover phase, once a placebo-controlled, dose-finding study had established 5mg as the dose with the optimal clinical utility, all patients were crossed over under blinded conditions to receive this dose. As this was primarily a safety study, the primary endpoints for the study were the incidence and nature of all serious adverse events (at any time before or after administration) and nonserious adverse events (within 24 hours of administration), as well as the incidence of clinically significant abnormalities in either ECG or haematology and clinical chemistry parameters. Nose and throat examinations were performed before and after the study at 30 predetermined trial centres. Other endpoint measures included headache response rate, pain-free assessments, reduction in headache intensity, time to resumption of normal activities and consistency of headache response. Efficacy rates were measured in 90-day intervals up to a period of 360 days. Zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg was well tolerated, with only 1.9% of patients withdrawing from the 12-month long-term trial because of adverse events. Adverse events occurred in 22.1% of attacks treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg, and the majority were of short duration and mild or moderate intensity. Serious adverse events occurred in 0.2% of attacks treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg. There was no evidence of increased incidence of adverse events with increasing duration of treatment. Nasopharyngeal adverse events were reported in 5.5% of attacks treated with zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg. Again, events were generally transient and of mild intensity. For the 1,093 patients who treated 13,806 attacks during the pre-crossover phase, headache response rates at 2 hours over all attacks were 73.2%, 70.5%, 49.9% and 41.5% for zolmitriptan nasal spray 5, 2.5, 1 and 0.5mg, respectively. Pain-free rates at 2 hours over all attacks were 51.5%, 48.1%, 24.7% and 21.8%, respectively. For the 783 patients receiving the 5mg dose in either the pre- or post-crossover phases, the 2-hour headache response rates were 72.9%, 74.4%, 74.6% and 74.1% for the four 90-day periods between day 0 and day 360. Normal activities were resumed within 2 hours in 60.4% of attacks. Long-term usage of zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg was also associated with a consistently effective response, with 57.8% of patients experiencing a 2-hour headache response in over 75% of attacks. The majority of patients (70.3%) rated their overall satisfaction with zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg as good or excellent. Zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg provides good tolerability and efficacy in long-term use in a clinical setting, with consistently high 2-hour headache and pain-free rates. This combination of benefits translates to high patient satisfaction with this formulation of zolmitriptan.", "outbound_citations": ["12864754", "12828501", "12412823", "12412822", "11972576", "11554952", "11294954", "10980723", "11089517", "10595285", "10473025", "9633720", "9371896", "9154322", "8951929", "9563207", "7928323", "3048700"], "inbound_citations": ["36224519", "34199479", "32747623", "26747634", "26255952", "26178694", "24848613", "24392978", "24024604", "20931348", "20420446"], "label": "0"}

To investigate the neuroendocrine profile of the 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist, zolmitriptan, in healthy volunteers. Twelve subjects entered a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design study of zolmitriptan (5 mg orally). Blood samples were taken at 15-min intervals for assay of prolactin and growth hormone. A further six healthy men were recruited to an equivalent study to examine the effect of ketanserin (a 5-HT receptor antagonist with some preference for 5-HT1D over 5-HT1B receptors) on the growth hormone response to zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan significantly increased plasma growth hormone but had no effect on plasma prolactin or oral temperature. The increase in growth hormone produced by zolmitriptan was significantly attenuated by ketanserin. We suggest that the ability of triptans such as zolmitriptan, sumatriptan and rizatriptan to increase plasma growth hormone is mediated by their common agonist activity at postsynaptic 5-HT1D receptors.", "outbound_citations": ["9630008", "9652357", "9572087", "9399012", "9326750", "9274976", "9243618", "9040124", "9606727", "9056052", "8791027", "8602897", "8035909", "8137520", "8131155", "2166920", "2365009", "6325044"], "inbound_citations": ["26189757", "23816589", "21982522"], "label": "0"}

Headache was assessed on a 4-point self-rating scale (0: none, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe). Other migraine symptoms were assessed as present or absent. Quality of life was assessed before the study and at the end of each treatment period. Two hundred and seventeen patients were eligible for the cross-over analysis. At 2 h post-dosing, an average of 78% of attacks per patient were successfully relieved (grade 3 or 2 to 1 or 0) by s.c. sumatriptan, compared with 34% for the usual treatments (p < 0.001) and 63% of attacks per patient were completely relieved (grade 0) by s.c. sumatriptan compared with 15% for the usual treatments (p < 0.001).

Background: Eletriptan is a potent and selective agonist at human recombinant 5HT1B/1D receptors, with efficacy in animal models that predict antimigraine activity. In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of eletriptan are characterized by linear and rapid oral absorption. Methods: Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study conducted in 857 outpatients with a diagnosis of migraine according to the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria. Of these, 692 took study medication for one acute migraine attack and provided on-drug efficacy data. Subjects received either placebo, 100 mg of sumatriptan or 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg of eletriptan for the treatment of an acute migraine attack. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a headache response (improvement in pain intensity from moderate or severe to mild or none) at 2 hours after treatment. Results: At the primary endpoint (2 hours after dosing), headache response rates were 24% (30/126) for placebo; 55% (63/115) for sumatriptan, 100 mg; 54% (70/129) for eletriptan, 20 mg; 65% (76/117) for eletriptan, 40 mg; and 77% (91/118) for eletriptan, 80 mg. There was a difference compared with placebo (p < 0.001) for all doses of eletriptan, and at 2 hours there was a difference between sumatriptan, 100 mg, and eletriptan, 80 mg (p < 0.001). Headache-free rates at 2 hours were superior to placebo (6%; p < 0.001) for both the 80-mg dose of eletriptan (37%) and the 40-mg dose (29%), with the 80-mg dose also being superior to 100 mg of sumatriptan (23%; p < 0.05). Eletriptan and sumatriptan were well tolerated, and the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity and transient. Conclusion: In this placebo-controlled trial, eletriptan, at selected doses, demonstrated superior efficacy, onset of action and patient acceptability in the acute treatment of migraine when compared with oral sumatriptan and placebo.", "outbound_citations": ["10079003", "9886479", "11284462", "11284463", "9827244", "9633720", "9071263", "8912486", "8710123", "8792034", "7869073", "8436495", "1326404", "1599358", "1653135"], "inbound_citations": ["36430602", "32956223", "33008517", "31107493", "29315874", "29448820", "27521843", "27582896", "25624770", "25155004", "23228070", "22336868", "22336784", "20687618", "21172952"], "label": "1"}

The recurrence rate, once at least 62.5% (5 out of 8 attacks), decreased to 14.2% (38 out of 268 attacks) with the combination of compounds (p<0.0001). We then studied two groups of 13 patients made randomicaly from the 67 initially evaluated, that were given sumatriptan 100 mg plus naproxen sodium 550 mg or placebo, in a double-blind design, to treat 3 other consecutive migraine attacks. Each group of patients treated 39 attacks. The recurrence among the patients taking sumatriptan plus placebo was 59% (23 out of 39 attacks) and the recurrence presented by the group taking sumatriptan plus naproxen was 25.5% (10 out of 39 attacks) (p<0.0003). We concluded that the combination of sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium decreases significantly migraine recurrence presented by patients taking sumatriptan alone.", "outbound_citations": ["10234467", "9504998", "8710123", "8665577", "8614525", "8749242", "7828190", "7516861", "8397070", "8133429", "1379152", "2177047", "2897560", "3282670", "3048700", "3926322", "3893730", "3886154", "6989789", "14149157"], "inbound_citations": ["31563229", "27096438"], "label": "0"}

The VAS and 4GS were equally useful in demonstrating that the active drugs were superior to placebo at reducing headache pain, and in showing that the active drugs were similarly effective.

The International Headache Society Committee on Clinical Trials in Migraine developed a tool to guide in designing scientifically sound trials. The proof of effect is best achieved in a clinical trial with: clearly defined objectives;a well-characterised study population, identified using well-validated diagnostic tools;proper randomisation and blinding;inclusion of a placebo arm, with proper balancing of patients receiving placebo and those receiving active drug;adequate study power; and appropriate statistical methods. Both parallel and crossover studies may be suitable in clinical trials of antimigraine agents, although the latter are a better choice in patient preference and bioequivalence studies. Although various efficacy measures are used to assess treatment effect, the 2-hour pain free rate (total resolution of pain within 2 hours after an initial moderate to severe headache) is preferred because it is clinically relevant and is relatively 'placebo-insensitive'. Various migraine surveys have indicated that a rapid onset of therapeutic effect is a highly desirable attribute of an antimigraine drug. Therefore, accurate measurements of treatment effect before 2 hours are becoming increasingly emphasised. Consistency of effect across multiple attacks adds to the understanding of the therapeutic efficacy of a test drug. Finally, preference and satisfaction studies allow us to assess patients' global impression of a particular treatment, weighing the positive effects on pain and associated symptoms of migraine against potential adverse effects.", "outbound_citations": ["14687006", "12534572", "16010903", "11690728", "11219473", "11094106", "11167908", "11167902", "10980753", "11075838", "10787112", "10817444", "10636142", "10448541", "10526675", "10376171", "10219926", "10214771", "10099848", "10640259", "10386329", "11284462", "9876882", "11284463", "9748025", "9673807", "9409334", "9399010", "9371896", "9439085", "9084453", "8550361", "7644080", "7672955", "2036663", "6529526", "6691890", "11152011", "9601622", "9563207", "11089512", "10168042", "9546526", "3048700", "11122593"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

However, it is uncertain, whether sumatriptan also has a vasoconstrictive effect on cerebral arteries, which may influence vasoneuronal coupling and induce secondary cerebral blood flow changes. We studied changes of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and the pulsatility index (PI) in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) after stimulus activation before, 10 min and 30 min after subcutaneous application of 6 mg sumatriptan, in order to assess potential vasoactive effects on cerebral circulation. CBFV was recorded from both PCAs simultaneously in 27 migraineurs (twenty women, seven men, mean age 29 years), and arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) were monitored. Although the mean diastolic blood pressure rose significantly from 75 mm Hg to 81 mm Hg (P<0.05) and systolic blood pressure and respiration rates remained constant, average CBFV values remained constant. Similarly, the relative increase of CBFV by visual stimulation, which is clearly higher compared to controls in other studies (55.0% before, 52.6% after 10 min, and 52.4% after 30 min), and absolute mean values for CBFV and PI did not change after visual stimulation.

Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in patients with migraine have shown that zolmitriptan has good efficacy measured using 2 h response and pain-free rates. Migraine-associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, are also improved with zolmitriptan. Oral zolmitriptan (2.5 and 5 mg) has an onset of action within 45 min and efficacy is sustained in most patients who respond at 2 h. The orally-disintegrating zolmitriptan tablet has the advantage that it may be taken immediately, without the need for additional fluids, any time a migraine headache occurs. Patients may benefit in terms of improved efficacy from the convenience of the disintegrating tablet, since there is evidence that taking triptan therapy as early as possible in an attack is advantageous. For similar reasons, as well as improved efficacy, a nasal spray formulation is in development. Zolmitriptan is effective in the treatment of migraine associated with menses and migraine with aura. There is no tachyphylaxis following repeated doses for multiple attacks of migraine over a prolonged period of time. Compared to placebo, the incidence of persistent migraine headache is reduced by zolmitriptan and recurrent migraine headache occurs less frequently. Zolmitriptan has also shown efficacy in the treatment of persistent and/or recurrent migraine headache. Comparative clinical studies have shown overall that zolmitriptan has similar or superior efficacy to sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine. Specifically, zolmitriptan 2.5 mg was significantly more effective than sumatriptan 25 or 50 mg according to a number of end points, including headache response at 2 h. Oral zolmitriptan is also effective in the acute treatment of cluster headache. Zolmitriptan is generally well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild-to-moderate, transient and resolving without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The consistent efficacy in treating all types of migraine and the choice of available formulations make zolmitriptan acceptable to patients and a suitable first-line therapy for the treatment of migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["11972576", "11318880", "11279349", "11086366", "11071515", "11048903", "10759911", "10214535", "10640258", "10640259", "10357516", "9888613", "9833595", "10210888", "9793699", "9725543", "9725544", "9660035", "9595208", "9542478", "9529763", "9088582", "9453273", "9371896", "9401835", "9399016", "9399013", "9399015", "9350383", "9399012", "9399014", "9218881", "9205817", "9154322", "9170337", "9235291", "9051330", "9071263", "9009470", "9046718", "8980858", "8951929", "8710123", "8792040", "8614525", "8838441", "8730346", "8580474", "7658443", "7672955", "7783866", "7758095", "7697699", "7928312", "7928310", "8200786", "7909309", "8502385", "8502382", "8389009", "8334575", "8388188", "1337261", "1329294", "1653135", "1699472", "3282670", "2454066", "3048700", "3107334", "3324620", "3899452"], "inbound_citations": ["35519371", "29380155", "27128792", "26724690"], "label": "1"}

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether such an effect occurs also in patients with ineffective oesophageal motility (IOM). 16 patients (nine males and seven females, age range 34\u201355 years) with chest pain and mild to moderate dysphagia were studied; all had undergone previous cardiologic, radiologic and upper gastrointestinal endoscopic exams that were normal. An oesophageal manometry was performed using an electronic probe to record swallows, oesophageal, LOS and gastric motility. The patients whose motor pattern were compatible with IOM (>30% of motor waves with amplitude <30 mmHg and/or non\u2010transmitted) received SUM or placebo 6 mg s.c., injected in the morning and in the afternoon in a random order. The data analysis was limited to 1 h before and 1 h after the drug injections. Ten out of the 16 patients showed an IOM motor pattern. The administration of SUM caused a significant increase in the number of swallows (SUM 99.5 \u00b1 15.4 vs 78.6 \u00b1 16.1 basal, P = 0.03) and of primary oesophageal motor waves (SUM 89.6 \u00b1 13.4 vs 67.2 \u00b1 12.9 basal, P = 0.04) with no significant changes in the percentage of swallows associated with propagation. Placebo was not associated with increase in the number of swallows (80.3 \u00b1 14.6, P = 0.9) or of primary oesophageal motor waves (70.1 \u00b1 12.3, P = 0.7). The amplitude and the percentage of propagated oesophageal motor waves as well as the mean basal LOS tone were unaltered by SUM. There was no change in the symptoms reported after SUM. Although effective in healthy subjects, SUM 6 mg s.c. improves only the numbers but not the amplitude or propagation of oesophageal motility of patients with IOM.

The headache is often pounding and the connections of the trigeminal nerve, the trigeminovascular system, have therefore been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine and studied extensively. Considerable attention has been given to the peripheral ramifications of the system as a possible locus of action for anti-migraine drugs while little attention has been focused upon possible central sites of action. It has been shown that certain peptides can act as markers for the trigeminal system, in particular calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and that CGRP is elevated in migraine. We have employed an animal model for activation of the trigeminovascular system to evaluate a new antimigraine compound, 311C90, that may have central and as well as peripheral trigeminal actions. Cats were anesthetized by halothane induction and alpha-chloralose maintenance (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), intubated, paralyzed and ventilated. Biparietal craniotomies were carried out to measure cerebral blood flow using laser Doppler flowmetry (CBFLDF). The external jugular vein was cannulated and blood drawn, centrifuged and frozen until processing. Stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion resulted in a mean maximum increase in CBFLDF of 39 +/- 5% at 20/s. The 5HT1 agonist 311C90 was administered intravenously in two doses (30 and 100 micrograms/kg) to cover the range of doses likely to be effective clinically.

Patients with a history of migraine were randomized in a double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose range-finding study of oral zolmitriptan 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg versus placebo for the treatment of a severe or moderate migraine headache. Patients with persistent or recurrent headache 4 to 24 hours after the initial dose, who did not take escape medication, were eligible to receive a second blinded dose of either zolmitriptan or placebo. Of 1,144 patients treated, 999 evaluable patients completed the study. The headache response rates with zolmitriptan doses \u2265 2.5 mg were 44 to 51% at 1 hour, 65 to 67% at 2 hours, and 75 to 78% at 4 hours (all significantly superior to placebo). Also, zolmitriptan effectively relieved migraine-associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, and reduced activity impairment. Rates of headache recurrence, headache persistence, and use of escape medication were lower with zolmitriptan doses \u2265 2.5 mg than with placebo. In patients with persistent or recurrent headache, a second zolmitriptan dose effectively treated both headache and nonheadache symptoms. Zolmitriptan was well tolerated, with a lower incidence of adverse events being reported with doses\u2264 2.5 mg than with those \u22655 mg. Zolmitriptan is a well tolerated and effective acute migraine therapy providing rapid relief of migraine headache within 1 hour. A clear dose-response relationship between efficacy and tolerability suggests that 2.5 mg is the optimal initial dose for the acute treatment of a migraine attack.", "outbound_citations": ["9071266", "8614525", "8838441", "8824686", "8791027", "8730346", "8536293", "7644079", "7644082", "7835382", "8397070", "8395298"], "inbound_citations": ["33003955", "29212383", "29226741", "27521843"], "label": "1"}

Individual patient data from randomised controlled trials of single-dose analgesics in acute postoperative pain were used. The methods used were as follows: data from 132 treatments with over 4700 patients were used to calculate mean %maxSPID (categorical pain intensity), %maxVAS-SPID (visual analogue pain intensity) and %maxVAS-TOTPAR (visual analogue pain relief); these were used to derive relationships with the number of patients who achieved at least 50% pain relief (%maxTOTPAR). Good agreement was obtained between the actual number of patients with > 50%maxTOTPAR and the number calculated for all three measures. For SPID, verification included independent data sets. For calculations involving each measure, summing the positive and negative differences between actual and calculated numbers of patients with > 50%maxTOTPAR gave an average difference of less than 0.25 patients per treatment arm. Reports of randomised trials of analgesics frequently describe results of studies in the form of mean derived indices, rather than using discontinuous events, such as number of proportion of patients obtaining at least 50% pain relief. Because mean data inadequately describe information with a non-normal distribution, combining such mean data in systematic reviews may compromise the results. Showing that dichotomous data can reliably be derived from mean SPID, VAS-SPID and VAS-TOTPAR as well as TOTPAR data in previously published acute pain studies makes much more information accessible for meta-analysis.", "outbound_citations": ["9085303", "9060022", "8880845", "8740611"], "inbound_citations": ["36183144", "36030145", "35572961", "34871903", "34499349", "33427305", "34559424", "33078388", "32797734", "32702783", "29064877", "29965830", "29623148", "30153336", "28540716", "28850360", "28186223", "28457571", "27654994", "27412362", "27213715", "27096578", "26544675", "26474382", "26496317", "26414123", "26151766", "26130144", "25132607", "25821010", "25624078", "26171993", "25502052", "25395825", "24809657", "24762895", "23969325", "24338830", "24277663", "24151035", "24150982", "23794268", "23689786", "23388359", "23440827", "22537100", "23164205", "23115700", "22513905", "22419293", "21975764", "21901726", "21540652", "21414722", "21412904", "21328296", "20824835", "20640471", "20614451", "20624245", "20464764", "20442167", "20393966", "20393958"], "label": "0"}

These interactions are probably due to the induction of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP1A2 and the transport protein P-glycoprotein by constituent(s) in SJW. The degree of induction is unpredictable due to factors such as the variable quality and quantity of constituent(s) in SJW preparations. In addition, possible pharmacodynamic interactions with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and serotonin (5-HT(1d)) receptor-agonists such as triptans used to treat migraine were identified. These interactions are associated with an increased risk of adverse reactions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn Sweden and the UK the potential risks to patients were judged to be significant and therefore information about the interactions was provided to health care professionals and patients.

Studies relating to this topic have focused on healthy volunteers and animals and have largely been confined to the effects of single drug doses. There is limited information about the effects of disease on pharmacokinetics under steady-state conditions. Changes in gastrointestinal motility may affect the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs by altering the rate of delivery, bioavailability or mucosal absorption of the drug. In general the rate of absorption and time taken to achieve maximal plasma concentrations for well absorbed drugs may be modified by changes in gastrointestinal motility, but overall bioavailability is not usually affected. In these cases the therapeutic and clinical effects of the alteration in pharmacokinetics will, therefore, depend on which parameters are important for the action of the drug. For poorly absorbed drugs both the rate of absorption and bioavailability are likely to be altered by changes in gastrointestinal motility. However, the complex effects of food and disease, as well as the properties and formulation of any drug (solubility, ease of dispersion, delayed release formulation) often make the prediction of the magnitude, or even the direction, of any effect difficult to predict. Drugs with direct effects on gastrointestinal motility may influence their own patterns of absorption.

Its efficacy and tolerability have been assessed in a number of randomised, controlled trials in over 4800 adults with moderate or severe attacks of migraine. Oral almotriptan has a rapid onset of action (significant headache relief is observed 0.5 hours after administration of a 12.5mg dose) and efficacy is sustained in most patients who respond by 2 hours. The drug is significantly more effective than placebo as measured by a number of parameters including 2-hour headache response and pain-free response rates. Other symptoms of migraine, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, are also alleviated by almotriptan. The efficacy of oral almotriptan appears to be maintained over repeated doses for multiple attacks of migraine treated over a long period (up to 1 year). High headache response rates were reported over all attacks without tachyphylaxis. For the relief of single attacks of migraine, oral almotriptan 12.5mg had similar efficacy to oral sumatriptan 50mg. Patients given almotriptan report less concern with adverse effects than patients given sumatriptan. The lower incidence of chest pain following treatment with almotriptan than with sumatriptan may lead to a reduction in direct costs, with fewer patients requiring management of chest pain. Almotriptan is well tolerated. Most adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, transient and generally resolved without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The most common adverse events associated with oral almotriptan 12.5mg treatment were dizziness, paraesthesia, nausea, fatigue, headache, somnolence, skeletal pain, vomiting and chest symptoms. The incidence of adverse events did not differ from placebo and decreased in the longer term. Almotriptan can be coadministered with drugs that share a common hepatic metabolic path; in addition, dosage reduction is required only in the presence of severe renal or hepatic impairment. Almotriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe attacks of migraine in adults. An oral dose of almotriptan 12.5mg has shown greater efficacy than placebo; current data indicate that efficacy is similar to that of oral sumatriptan 50mg, and is maintained in the long term (< or = 1 year). Almotriptan has a good adverse event profile and a generally similar overall tolerability profile to sumatriptan; of note, almotriptan is associated with a significantly lower incidence of chest pain than sumatriptan. However, further clinical experience is required to clearly define the place of almotriptan among the other currently available triptans. Nevertheless, because triptans have an important place in various management regimens, and because the nature of individual patient response to triptans is idiosyncratic, almotriptan is likely to become a useful treatment option in the management of adults with moderate or severe migraine headaches.", "outbound_citations": ["11723269", "11737005", "11405809", "11422001", "11385257", "11243418", "11210405", "11298665", "11219473", "11134654", "11134655", "11075844", "10824628", "10636173", "5325360", "10659603", "11859905"], "inbound_citations": ["24312833"], "label": "1"}

Of these, 203 met the inclusion criteria and 164 (81%) completed our telephone survey. The main outcome measures were healthcare costs to the HMO and number of days free of migraine-related disability before and after sumatriptan treatment. Before sumatriptan treatment, 89% of patients reported severe migraine, compared with 63% after sumatriptan treatment. The number of monthly migraine disability days decreased from 6.5 days per month before sumatriptan to 3.9 days per month after sumatriptan. Healthcare utilization rates (ie, number of hospitalizations, emergency department visits) and costs were lower after the patients began taking sumatriptan. The number of different over-the-counter medicines and prescription medications (other than sumatriptan) taken for migraine disabilities decreased. Although total drug expenditures per month increased, the total migraine healthcare expenditure was 41% lower after sumatriptan was initiated. The cost-effectiveness ratio was 47% more favorable after patients started taking sumatriptan. Overall, patients reported fewer migraine-related disabilities, had lower migraine severity scores, and used fewer healthcare resources when taking sumatriptan. These changes resulted in a better cost-effectiveness ratio for migraine treatment.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

Methods: Twelve items describing the impact of MS on walking (12-Item MS Walking Scale [MSWS-12]) were generated from 30 patient interviews, expert opinion, and literature review. Preliminary psychometric evaluation (data quality, scaling assumptions, acceptability, reliability, validity) was undertaken in the data generated by 602 people from the MS Society membership database. Further psychometric evaluation (including comprehensive validity assessment, responsiveness, and relative efficiency) was conducted in two hospital-based samples: people with primary progressive MS (PPMS; n = 78) and people with relapses admitted for IV steroid treatment (n = 54). Results: In all samples, missing data were low (\u22643.8%), item test\u2013retest reproducibility was high (\u22650.78), scaling assumptions were satisfied, and reliability was high (\u22650.94). Correlations between the MSWS-12 and other scales were consistent with a priori hypotheses. The MSWS-12 (relative efficiency = 1.0) was more responsive than the Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis mobility scale (0.72), the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical functioning scale (0.33), the Expanded Disability Status Scale (0.03), the 25-ft Timed Walk Test (0.44), and Guy\u2019s Neurologic Disability Scale lower limb disability item (0.10).

In this study we investigated whether SU administration influences GHRH-induced GH secretion in 8 acromegalics, and 6 age-matched normal volunteers, as a control group. We evaluated the effects of SU (6 mg s.c.) or placebo (PL) administration on GHRH (1 microgram/kg bw i.v.)-induced GH and PRL secretion. After SU priming the GH response to GHRH did not changed in acromegalics, but significantly decreased in controls, in comparison with that observed after PL plus GHRH. In acromegalics, no difference in GH peak was seen after SU plus GHRH and PL plus GHRH, nor was any difference seen in AUC between tests. In controls, no difference was seen in GH peaks, while SU priming significantly (P < 0.03) decreased the AUC 90-120 min of GH after GHRH administration. In acromegalics, SU did not change the slight GHRH-induced increase in PRL levels. Our study documents that 5-HT1 D receptors do not interfere with GHRH-stimulated GH secretion in acromegalic subjects. In normals, SU is able to decrease GH response to GHRH, thus confirming that 5-HT1D receptors are able to modulate GH secretion in normals.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

It accounts for up to 28% of patients presenting to a gastroenterology practice and poses a significant personal, societal and economic burden internationally. The Manning, Rome I and Rome II criteria were developed to identify appropriate IBS patients for entry into IBS studies in a consistent manner. Refinements in the understanding of the physiology of the enteric nervous system (ENS), which controls motility, secretion and sensation, provided the basis for our comprehension of the pathophysiology of IBS. Visceral hypersensitivity and neurotransmitter imbalance currently receive the most attention as possible mechanisms of IBS. This article outlines conventional treatments and reviews the data on emerging and experimental therapies for IBS. Emerging therapies for IBS using 5-HT mediation include 5-HT3 antagonists, such as ondasetron, granisetron and alosetron, as well as 5-HT4 agonists such as tegaserod and prucalopride. In addition to opioid agonists (e.g. fedotozine) several other drugs that act on other ENS receptors are being studied. In spite of significant progress in IBS research, these emerging therapies require more studies before they can be utilised as clinical treatments.", "outbound_citations": ["9635630", "12469960", "11438309", "11207504", "11171824", "11159896", "11159875", "11156653", "11116283", "10821802", "10734015", "10716674", "10716675", "10744088", "10702196", "10632642", "10975022", "11059442", "10896640", "10588168", "10588172", "10571597", "10571606", "10571599", "10980983", "10580919", "10468696", "10471214", "10455293", "10413072", "10429742", "10429737", "10220496", "10429736", "10205205", "10209681", "10202212", "9834261", "9768527", "9679042", "9697101", "9616313", "9692698", "9505884", "9362196", "9390111", "9414975", "29585440", "9364286", "9178709", "9145774", "9142924", "9080994", "9089425", "9067313", "8971289", "8853764", "8913711", "16844018", "8793911", "8544549", "7760870", "7605851", "7865642", "7932195", "8138933", "8185213", "8298816", "8280823", "8387353", "1336675", "1434911", "1981581", "2571877", "2731752", "2908757", "2973243", "3286362", "3169446", "3623019", "3569764", "2869331", "719487", "698649"], "inbound_citations": ["32773048", "31604682", "28894393", "28867492", "27922695"], "label": "0"}

Therefore, we evaluated the postprandial symptoms in functional dyspepsia (FD) patients classified according to proximal stomach function. In addition, the effect of gastric relaxation induced by sumatriptan on postprandial symptoms was studied in FD patients with impaired fundic accommodation.METHODS:Twenty-five healthy volunteers (HVs) and 44 FD patients filled out a disease-specific questionnaire (Nepean Dyspepsia Index) and underwent a gastric barostat study to evaluate visceral sensitivity, meal-induced fundic relaxation, and postprandial symptoms. Postprandial symptoms evoked by a drink test or reported during the barostat study were compared between FD patients subdivided according to the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Finally, the effect of sumatriptan on postprandial symptoms evoked by a drink test was investigated in HVs and in FD patients with impaired fundic accommodation.RESULTS:There was no clear relationship between any of the 15 Nepean Dyspepsia Index symptoms and proximal stomach function. Postprandial symptoms evoked during the barostat study or after the drink tests were significantly higher in FD patients than in HVs; however, no clear differences in symptom profile could be demonstrated between the different subclasses of FD. Sumatriptan did not affect the maximal ingested volume or the postprandial symptoms in HVs or FD patients after a drink test.CONCLUSIONS:No clear relationship could be demonstrated between postprandial symptoms and proximal stomach function.", "outbound_citations": ["9881511", "9125638", "10861261", "10652116", "10483997", "10457043", "10029608", "10029616", "10102954", "9862826", "10328715", "9834261", "9834290", "29585463", "9726390", "9691920", "9691921", "9616311", "9142924", "8612991", "8633496", "8680904", "8150341", "1529280", "1551533", "1889724", "1896827", "2894503"], "inbound_citations": ["32940846", "32432141", "31917915", "30673985", "29674959", "28899670", "28104632", "28814481", "28423481", "28105529", "27958284"], "label": "0"}

In this study, we first analyzed the effects of opposing verbal suggestions on experimental ischemic arm pain in healthy volunteers and on motor performance in Parkinsonian patients and found that verbally induced expectations of analgesia/hyperalgesia and motor improvement/worsening antagonized completely the effects of a conditioning procedure. We also measured the effects of opposing verbal suggestions on hormonal secretion and found that verbally induced expectations of increase/decrease of growth hormone (GH) and cortisol did not have any effect on the secretion of these hormones. However, if a preconditioning was performed with sumatriptan, a 5-HT1B/1D agonist that stimulates GH and inhibits cortisol secretion, a significant increase of GH and decrease of cortisol plasma concentrations were found after placebo administration, although opposite verbal suggestions were given. These findings indicate that verbally induced expectations have no effect on hormonal secretion, whereas they affect pain and motor performance. This suggests that placebo responses are mediated by conditioning when unconscious physiological functions such as hormonal secretion are involved, whereas they are mediated by expectation when conscious physiological processes such as pain and motor performance come into play, even though a conditioning procedure is performed.", "outbound_citations": ["7799003", "12620603", "12449081", "12390633", "12167757", "11986125", "11834781", "11772700", "11498597", "11459896", "11406341", "11407649", "11222807", "11207391", "11207392", "10686528", "11188968", "10844377", "10534585", "10212322", "10204979", "10051763", "9870976", "9770557", "9778260", "9272794", "9211474", "8783319", "7775648", "7640145", "8035909", "2277714", "2780058", "3365327", "3364852", "3981392", "6514008", "6308540", "7279424", "7370359", "4572208", "14126847", "13954106", "14497895", "13752532", "13424736", "PMC6782391", "PMC6782226", "PMC1365126", "80579", "PMC1737509", "13080040"], "inbound_citations": ["37196928", "37120641", "37093367", "37043203", "36961347", "36517733", "36471639", "36304856", "36231179", "35810479", "35774946", "35532994", "35547193", "35457014", "35266226", "35338314", "35512392", "35230245", "36891035", "34949831", "34845956", "34827526", "35051685", "34566591", "36317867", "34538720", "35295512", "34408060", "34311793", "34237458", "34145580", "33684624", "33842592", "33587782", "33549749", "34256381", "33462278", "33449503", "33340878", "33594991", "34225946", "33394880", "33133178", "32977761", "32940864", "32920787", "32826757", "32772861", "32730049", "32849024", "32701541", "32609651", "32639369", "32537245", "32563292", "32563287", "33467255", "32379766", "32366650", "33012687", "32281821", "32191722", "32218746", "32218757", "32966280", "31993783", "32563285", "31282698", "31414966", "31494273", "31165888", "31719077", "31708807", "31609920", "30649442", "31607964", "31551779", "31552390", "30952053", "31383848", "31428002", "31376878", "31103487", "31209960", "31312148", "31583358", "31230007", "31203560", "31214057", "31150780", "31132015", "31583340", "31583343", "31354941", "30914952", "30804816", "30439452", "30395877", "30680223", "30216744", "30110575", "30590067", "30457698", "30316203", "31683023", "31607964", "31437089", "30618877", "30526233", "30337029", "29408484", "28595945", "30487547", "30405506", "30405453", "30293977", "30178433", "30246799", "30145820", "30132980", "30104988", "30045638", "29697530", "29631002", "29947999", "31354227", "29343158", "29016984", "29785686", "29483349", "29755621", "29613940", "29535508", "29455296", "29108801", "29670678", "29357856", "29025685", "28157138", "30146052", "30146050", "30146056", "29947820", "29681321", "29681332", "29681335", "29681334", "29681337", "29681336", "29681322", "29321752", "29263691", "28614188", "29392236", "28895186", "28804807", "28399689", "28750001", "27720917", "28216206", "28792170", "28643901", "28363152", "28195855", "28667217", "28249354", "28375723", "28798505", "27995547", "28299460", "28971165", "28161116", "28225816", "27866713", "28183096", "28112207", "28081134", "27477808", "26827944", "27338671", "27461877", "26861164", "27695361", "27499483", "27023425", "27470917", "25924098", "27354202", "27378898", "27269794", "27108268", "26492629", "27118280", "26706890", "27157112", "26814620", "26785162", "26706052", "27436417", "26462570", "26369906", "26814278", "26759785", "27719874", "26613625", "26698663"], "label": "0"}

The incidence of adverse events was similar between zolmitriptan and sumatriptan groups but was slightly lower in the placebo group.

The study also aimed to provide an initial safety profile for 311C90 when taken during the aura. Forty patients (31 females, 9 males) were entered into this outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trial. They all almost invariably experienced a migraine headache after the aura phase. Patients treated two migraine attacks during the aura phase in a random order, one with 311C90 20 mg and the other with placebo. Efficacy assessments were recorded on standard diary cards completed by each patient. A primary response was defined as the complete absence of headache pain in the 24 hour period following administration of the first dose of study medication. Safety assessments included ECGs, laboratory tests and the recording of adverse experiences. Twenty patients completed the study by treating 2 attacks, 16 of these were fully adherent to the study protocol. Three of the 16 patients responded to 311C90 whereas all patients developed a migraine headache after taking placebo. Two patients who did not respond to 311C90 described the developing headache as being \"non-migraine'. Adverse experiences reported were similar to those experienced by patients in previous studies when 311C90 was taken during a migraine headache. There were no reports of 311C90-related adverse effects on the aura. These preliminary results suggest that oral 311C90 may be of value in preventing a migraine headache and is safe when taken during the aura phase.

In the clinical arena, Rapoport et al.1 and Solomon et al.2 report beneficial results in large trials with zolmitriptan, a new orally active antimigraine agent; Ryan et al.3 report improved efficacy using a sumatriptan nasal spray during acute migraine headaches. Both drugs are intended to shorten an attack, reduce the recurrence rate, and treat associated symptoms while avoiding parenteral administration. In a seemingly unrelated report, Gardner et al.4 provide evidence using linkage analysis for a new familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) locus on chromosome 1q31. This important finding complements a recent discovery showing that a gene encoding the \u03b11A subunit of the P/Q calcium channel is mutated in approximately 50% of families with FHM. Basic and clinical neuroscientists will be excited by the Gardner report because it hints at the possibility of a mutation in the \u03b11E subunit of a related calcium channel. Together, these four reports emphasize that rapid new developments in the biology and treatment of migraine are changing our views about the origins of neurovascular pain syndromes.\n\nThe end. Zolmitriptan(S)-4[[3-2[2-(dimethylamino-amino)ethyl-1H-indol-5-yl]methyl]-2-oxazolidinone) is a designer drug that structurally resembles sumatriptan(3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-methyl-1H-indole-5-methanesulfonamide). Both are agonists that bind with high affinity to 5-HT1D, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT1F receptors. 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptors are expressed on trigeminal nerve endings and when occupied by one of these drugs they block neuropeptide release as well as alter neurotransmission in trigeminovascular neurons, possibly within the brainstem as well. 5-HT1B receptors are expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells and mediate vasoconstriction. Both mechanisms may be important for drug action.5 Because of an unfavorable lipid partition coefficient, sumatriptan crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly; therefore, a \u2026", "outbound_citations": ["9371896", "9222161", "9196907", "8929530", "8898206", "8858142", "7644082", "7828190", "8200021", "8258424", "1333181"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

A highly sensitive LCMS-MS assay has been developed which allows quantification of plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite, 183C91, after therapeutic doses. Two studies using this assay method were conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics, including absolute bioavailability, of 2.5 and 5 mg oral doses of zolmitriptan in men and women, the dose-proportionality of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg doses and the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of a 5 mg oral dose.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo randomized, balanced, open-label, 4-period crossover studies were conducted in a total of 32 healthy volunteers. The first study determined the absolute bioavailability of 2.5 and 5 mg doses of zolmitriptan and compared the pharmacokinetics in men and women. The second study examined the dose-proportionality in pharmacokinetics after fasting doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg, and the effect of food on a 5 mg dose. Blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, clinical chemistry, haematology and adverse events were also monitored.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean (s.d.) absolute oral bioavailability was 0.41 (0.14 and 0.40) 0.09 after 2.5 mg and 0.48+/-0.14 and 0.36+/-0.07 after 5 mg in women and men, respectively.

Two independent double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered sumatriptan following ascending single doses (three different dose levels) and multiple doses. In the four-way crossover, ascending-dose study, 20 healthy female subjects were randomized to receive on separate occasions single intranasal spray doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg sumatriptan (as the hemisulphate salt) or placebo into one nostril. Adverse events were mild and consisted mainly of bitter taste at the back of the throat and events typical of sumatriptan administered by other routes (headache, lightheadedness and tingling). Area under the plasma sumatriptan concentration versus time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) increased with the dose. Dose proportionality was demonstrated between 5 and 10 mg but not across the dose range 5\u201320 mg. Time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) was variable due to multiple peaking. The elimination half-life (t1/2), approximately 2 h, was unaffected by the magnitude of dose. In the two-period, multiple-dose, crossover study, 12 healthy adult male and female subjects were randomized to receive either sumatriptan hemisulphate 20 mg or placebo, administered intranasally as a spray three times a day for 4 days, The two dosing periods were separated by 3 to 14 days. Multiple doses of sumatriptan were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events occurring or withdrawals due to adverse events. All patients reported a mild to moderate drug-related disturbance of taste. Nasal examinations remained normal, and olfactory function was unaffected. The AUC over the first 8 h following dosing (AUC8) and fraction of the dose excreted in the urine (fe; 6.2% vs 3.6%) were similar on Days 1 and 4. Day 4 values were significantly higher (p0.05) for Cmax (16.9 ng/ml vs 13.1 ng/ml), renal clearance (Clr; 19.0 l/h vs 14.2 l/h), and t1/2 (2.18 h vs 1.93 h), and shorter for tmax (0.88 h vs 1.75 h). Some accumulation (22%) occurred over the 4 days of dosing. Serum concentrations of the pharmacologically inactive indole acetic acid metabolite of sumatriptan were fourfold to fivefold higher than corresponding sumatriptan concentrations. Overall, these studies show the sumatriptan intranasal spray formulation is well tolerated, allows rapid absorption of sumatriptan, and results in only a clinically insignificant degree of sumatriptan accumulation upon repeated dosing.", "outbound_citations": ["9795022", "7737863", "8161354", "8145914", "8330463", "8381488", "1617857", "1647495", "1681162", "1851894", "1653135", "1665260", "1653138", "2510960"], "inbound_citations": ["34923646", "31830691", "29878341", "28597922", "27613076", "27621672", "27518323", "26865407", "25514481", "24681294", "24024600", "21964172", "20481648"], "label": "0"}

In a phase III, multinational, randomised clinical trial, 692 patients treated a migraine attack with eletriptan 40 mg or 80 mg, or placebo. Patients responded to a questionnaire seeking information concerning the amount of time lost from usual activities during the attack. Time loss assessments were made 24 hours after the last dose taken and recorded in a diary. Patients receiving either dose of the active compound were unable to perform their usual activities for a median period of 4 hours compared with 9 hours experienced by those taking placebo. This difference was highly statistically significant (p < 0.001). The time saving associated with eletriptan usage reflected the differences in efficacy findings in the clinical component of the study. In this placebo-controlled trial, eletriptan produced a significant reduction in the loss of usual functioning time associated with a migraine attack. This gain clearly represents a substantial benefit to patients with migraine irrespective of how it might most appropriately be valued in monetary terms.

This study used ergotamine and sumatriptan prescription data representing inhabitants of eight cities in the Netherlands and covering the period of 1991\u20131997. The yearly incidence of new users between 1991 and 1997 was estimated for both drugs as well as for the drug of first choice to be prescribed to patients initiating specific abortive migraine treatment with either ergotamine or sumatriptan. Intra-individual ergotamine and sumatriptan usage patterns, characterized by single (incidental), continuous (rate of retention) or switch use, were examined for five patient cohorts, each for a follow-up period of 1 year. During the year of sumatriptan introduction (1991\u20131992), the overall incidence of new use for both drugs was highest (5.4 per 1000 inhabitants). Hereafter, a substantial reduction of more than 50% was observed. From 1992 to 1996, the yearly incidence of ergotamine first-time use was significantly higher than that of sumatriptan and up to 1996 ergotamine was more than twice as likely than sumatriptan to be prescribed to patients initiating specific abortive treatment. Hereafter, sumatriptan was as likely as ergotamine to be prescribed as the drug of first choice, which coincided with the full reimbursement of sumatriptan tablets. Overall, neurologists were more likely than general practitioners (GPs), to prescribe sumatriptan as the drug of first choice. Approximately half of the total study population were identified as single-time users. This phenomonen occurred more frequently in the ergotamine cohorts. The sumatriptan cohorts displayed a slight yet significant stronger retention rate compared with the ergotamine cohorts. The overall impact of sumatriptan on ergotamine use in The Netherlands was marginal, predominantly due to GP's adherence to migraine treatment guidelines and reimbursement policies concerning sumatriptan tablets. Overall, incidental use was relatively high and may reflect the reported difficulties in diagnosing migraine, lack of patient\u2013doctor consultation, or that anticipated benefits of the drug were not achieved.

Although statistically significant differences in lost nonworkplace activity time and lost workplace productivity time between the usual therapy and sumatriptan treatment periods were detected using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, this test could not determine whether differences were attributable to inherent trends in the data. This current study employed time series analysis, which detects and controls for preexisting trends in data, to further explore the possibility that the observed reductions in lost time in the two clinical studies were related to management of the subjects with sumatriptan. The intercepts and slopes of the computed linear models suggest that the initiation of sumatriptan therapy produced savings of 0.8 hours of nonworkplace activity time and 0.5 hours of workplace productivity time per patient per week. These savings were sustained throughout the sumatriptan treatment period. Preexisting trends in the data were not detected in the models. Thus the productivity gains are not associated with either time effects or the statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean, but variables that are extreme in initial measurements will tend to be closer to the center of the distribution in subsequent measurements. This strengthens the hypothesis that management of migraine with sumatriptan is associated with reductions in lost productivity time.", "outbound_citations": ["8792034", "8900548", "8984084", "7928312", "8376093", "8374937", "2404151", "3282670", "7258429"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

Aims\u2014To study the effect of sumatriptan, an agonist of enteric neuronal 5HT1P receptors, on interdigestive motility in man. Subjects and methods\u2014In 12 healthy subjects, interdigestive motility was recorded manometrically in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In seven subjects blood samples were drawn every 15 minutes for radioimmunoassay of motilin and somatostatin. After two phase 3s of the migrating motor complex, 6 mg of sumatriptan was administered subcutaneously. Recording continued until two more phase 3s had occurred. Results\u2014Sumatriptan induced a premature phase 3 in the jejunum after a median of 10 (8) minutes. The duration of the migrating motor complex cycle was shortened at the expense of phase 2. After sumatriptan, plasma somatostatin concentrations were reduced and gastric phase 3s were suppressed, although median motilin concentrations and the occurrence of plasma motilin peaks were not affected. Phase 3s of the migrating motor complex preceding sumatriptan were associated with motilin peaks, while phase 3s after sumatriptan were not. Furthermore, pretreatment with sumatriptan prevented the induction of a gastric phase 3 by the motilin agonist erythromycin.

Conclusion: Oral rizatriptan 10 mg was more effective than oral sumatriptan, naratriptan, and zolmitriptan on stringent outcome measures of pain-free response at 2 hours, symptom-free response at 2 hours, and 24-hour sustained pain-free response.", "outbound_citations": ["11167908", "11048903", "11075838", "11037741", "10529545", "11284462", "11284463", "9595867", "8912486"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

It is an effective treatment for acute migraine attacks and the injectable form has also shown efficacy in the treatment of cluster headaches. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, sumatriptan, administered subcutaneously, orally, intranasally or rectally was significantly more effective than placebo in relieving migraine headache and in producing resolution or reduction of other symptoms associated with migraine, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia. Improvements in clinical disability were also significantly greater after sumatriptan than after placebo. Headache recurred in 21 to 57% of patients who received oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan, but most patients responded to a second dose of the drug. Results of comparative trials showed that subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg was significantly more effective than either patients' usual antimigraine treatments or intranasal dihydroergotamine mesylate 1 mg in relieving migraine headache. Subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg and subcutaneous dihydroergotamine mesylate 1 mg provided similarly effective migraine relief, but the headache recurrence rate was significantly higher after sumatriptan than after this formulation of dihydroergotamine mesylate. Response rates achieved after oral sumatriptan were similar to those reported after treatment with oral naratriptan, rizatriptan or lysine acetylsalicylate plus metoclopramide. Treatment of acute migraine attacks with oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan leads to less loss of workplace productivity than other antimigraine therapies. Several pharmacoeconomic analyses showed that gains in workplace productivity in sumatriptan recipients ranged from 12.1 to 89.8 hours per patient per year. Significant improvements from baseline in overall health-related quality-of-life scores were also experienced by sumatriptan recipients. Sumatriptan is generally well tolerated. Nausea, vomiting, malaise and fatigue are the most common adverse events with oral sumatriptan. Injection site reactions occur in 10 to 40% of patients receiving the drug subcutaneously. A bitter taste at the back of the mouth occurs frequently after intranasal administration. Serious adverse events occur in about 0.14% of patients with migraine treated with sumatriptan. As the drug is associated with the rare development of cardiovascular effects, it is contraindicated in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Despite its relatively high acquisition cost, reductions in lost workplace productivity experienced by patients treated with sumatriptan may result in savings in the overall cost of migraine to society. Thus, sumatriptan is a useful first- or second-line treatment option for patients with moderate or severe migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["9563208", "9536565", "9453273", "9371898", "9362987", "9350382", "9286619", "9209776", "9209775", "9209774", "9205951", "10168035", "9153607", "9109909", "9146856", "9225277", "9071262", "9071263", "8980858", "8912486", "8922732", "8916568", "8873693", "8904614", "8869766", "8757005", "8839655", "8879897", "8792039", "8792028", "8792033", "8634619", "8682677", "8900548", "8733984", "8984084", "8866921", "8639069", "8838438", "8614488", "8614510", "8825693", "8720594", "8602731", "8537803", "8737753", "8539258", "8848207", "7564725", "8536304", "8536293", "8536303", "7553814", "7591736", "8527286", "7644082", "7644079", "7585925", "7783891", "7650235", "7738571", "7710149", "8744664", "7788702", "7758095", "7848120", "7823698", "8542914", "7697699", "7851052", "7843952", "7934471", "7934431", "7828190", "7987510", "8087924", "7954759", "7957591", "8014033", "7516861", "8062360", "8200027", "7835382", "8313451", "8251846", "8414324", "8262783", "7902233", "8393474", "8502385", "8389011", "8098831", "8334575", "8096565", "8388188", "1321655", "1327382", "1320974", "1379152", "1315562", "1659437", "1663596", "1676084", "1889975", "1653142", "1653135", "1653140", "2158835", "2544280", "8783473", "10168038", "10166407", "8878051", "10168041", "7553802", "10168040", "10146980", "1322512", "7768259", "1653141", "8739554", "15270595", "8720348", "10168039", "10160470", "7724476", "2045830", "7501338", "7964913", "7936279", "7875179", "8093509", "7926386", "8666030", "3048700"], "inbound_citations": ["37255866", "34532167", "34061415", "33550872", "31604019", "32038251", "31693358", "31291516", "27681528", "26242873", "25948722", "25488888", "24102636", "24189639", "23912626", "22302025", "22384463", "16706565", "22054121", "21540108", "21058956", "20528453", "20352590"], "label": "1"}

Background: CH frequently occurs during sleep. The authors previously found that symptoms of SDB predicted reported occurrence of CH in the first half of the night, which suggested that CH could be triggered in some cases by unrecognized SDB. Methods: The authors performed polysomnography in 25 adults (22 men) with CH. Subjects were not selected for any sleep-related complaint. In addition to standard measures, studies included monitoring of end-tidal carbon dioxide (n = 22), and esophageal pressure (n = 20). Results: The rate of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep was >5 in 20 subjects (80%; 95% CI, 64% to 96%), minimum oxygen saturation was <90% in 10 subjects, maximum negative esophageal pressure ranged from \u221213 to \u221265 cm H2O, and maximum end-tidal carbon dioxide was \u226550 mm Hg in eight subjects. The eight subjects with active (versus inactive) CH at the time of study had higher maximum end-tidal carbon dioxide levels (50 \u00b1 3 versus 44 \u00b1 5 mm Hg; p = 0.0007). More severe oxygen desaturation was associated with reports that CH typically occurred in the first half of the nocturnal sleep period (p = 0.008). Conclusions: SDB occurred in the majority of patients with CH.

In step care, treatment is escalated after first-line medications fail. In stratified care, initial treatment is based on measurement of the severity of illness or other factors. These strategies for migraine have not been rigorously evaluated.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the clinical benefits of 3 strategies: stratified care, step care within attacks, and step care across attacks, among patients with migraine.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nRandomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial conducted by the Disability in Strategies Study group from December 1997 to March 1999 in 88 clinical centers in 13 countries.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nA total of 835 adult migraine patients with a Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) grade of II, III, or IV were analyzed as the efficacy population; the safety analysis included 930 patients.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive (1) stratified care (n = 279), in which patients with MIDAS grade II treated up to 6 attacks with aspirin, 800 to 1000 mg, plus metoclopramide, 10 mg, and patients with MIDAS grade III and IV treated up to 6 attacks with zolmitriptan, 2.5 mg; (2) step care across attacks (n = 271), in which initial treatment was with aspirin, 800 to 1000 mg, plus metoclopramide, 10 mg. Patients not responding in at least 2 of the first 3 attacks switched to zolmitriptan, 2.5 mg, to treat the remaining 3 attacks; and (3) step care within attacks (n = 285), in which initial treatment for all attacks was with aspirin, 800 to 1000 mg, plus metoclopramide, 20 mg. Patients not responding to treatment after 2 hours in each attack escalated treatment to zolmitriptan, 2.5 mg.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nHeadache response, achieved if pain intensity was reduced from severe or moderate at baseline to mild or no pain at 2 hours; and disability time per treated attack at 4 hours for all 6 attacks, compared among the 3 groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHeadache response at 2 hours was significantly greater across 6 attacks in the stratified care treatment group (52.7%) than in either the step care across attacks group (40.6%; P<.001) or the step care within attacks group (36.4%; P<.001). Disability time (6 attacks) was significantly lower in the stratified care group (mean area under the curve [AUC], 185.0 mm. h) than in the step care across attacks group (mean AUC, 209.4 mm. h; P<.001) or the step care within attacks group (mean AUC, 199.7 mm. h; P<.001). The incidence of adverse events was higher in the stratified care group (321 events) vs both step care groups (159 events in across-attack group; 217 in within-attack group), although most events were of mild-to-moderate intensity.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results indicate that as a treatment strategy, stratified care provides significantly better clinical outcomes than step care strategies within or across attacks as measured by headache response and disability time.

The drug differs from presently available members of this drug class in that it combines 5HT1B/1D receptor partial agonist activity with robust oral pharmacokinetics and an ability to inhibit trigeminovascular activation centrally as well as peripherally in preclinical studies. Consistent with its selectivity for 5HT1B/1D receptors, zolmitriptan produces constriction of various isolated blood vessels, most notably cranial arteries. In anaesthetized animals, these vascular effects manifest as a selective constriction of cranial arterio-venous anastomoses resulting in a redistribution of carotid arterial blood flow. This effect is produced without significant effects on heart rate, blood pressure or blood flow to the brain, heart or lungs. Zolmitriptan also inhibits trigeminal-evoked increases in cerebral blood flow in anaesthetized cats and blocks trigeminal-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the dura of guinea-pigs. These actions are consistent with a pre-junctional inhibition of neuropeptide release from perivascular afferents of the trigeminal nerve, as confirmed by independent studies showing that zolmitriptan blocks elevations of calcitonin-gene-related peptide in jugular venous blood during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. In all of these effects, zolmitriptan is three to four times more potent than sumatriptan, but produces the same maximum response. Zolmitriptan crosses the intact blood-brain barrier to inhibit trigeminovascular activation in the brainstem. This was shown initially by the ability of the drug to block a brainstem reflex provoking vasoactive intestinal peptide release from the VIIth cranial (facial) nerve during trigeminal stimulation. Subsequent ex vivo autoradiography confirmed that intravenously injected [3H]zolmitriptan labels a discrete population of cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and nucleus tractus solitarius. Direct evidence for a central neuromodulatory effect of zolmitriptan was provided by electrophysiological experiments which clearly demonstrated that the drug inhibits the excitability of cells in the TNC after systemic administration. This novel preclinical profile not only distinguishes zolmitriptan from sumatriptan, but raises intriguing questions about the clinical relevance of a dual action. Studies to date show that zolmitriptan indeed modulates cranial sensory processing in humans, yet central side-effects are no different from sumatriptan. This property may account for the remarkable consistency in clinical efficacy observed in clinical trials.", "outbound_citations": ["9399016", "9399013", "9154322", "9170337", "9225265", "9071267", "9117091", "8967979", "8912486", "8951929", "8936345", "8791030", "8791027", "8550362", "8536293", "8528548", "7658443", "7589183", "24283575", "7697699", "7704102", "7938165", "7984266", "7972337", "7936279", "8395298", "8381056", "8388188", "1589909", "1329294", "1653134", "2043937", "1996883", "1653135", "1992824", "2252337", "1699472", "2544283", "2538191", "2664974", "3261196", "2454066", "2875415", "90971"], "inbound_citations": ["30393230", "28858962", "27760769", "26747634", "26228801", "25676136", "23221401", "23221402", "23430984", "22762358", "9829155", "22013519", "19825906"], "label": "0"}

Secondary objectives were to determine whether the factor structure changed in post-treatment visits compared with screening visits, to make recommendations for coding the MSQ when the patient did not have a migraine in the previous 4 weeks, and to modify the MSQ if so indicated by this research. Results supported the existence of 3 distinct factors which agreed strongly with the hypothesised dimensions. The analysis of post-treatment data suggested that the underlying factor structure of the MSQ varies as a result of treatment.

An understanding of the effect of particular medications on neurotransmitters is required and can guide the clinician in selecting therapeutic agents that have a low incidence of side effects and toxicity.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29867596", "20529274"], "label": "0"}

The objective of this study was to evaluate in two clinical studies the efficacy and tolerability of the intranasal form of sumatriptan in the acute treatment of a single migraine attack. International Headache Society-diagnosed adult migraineurs in two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter studies (n = 409 and 436) used sumatriptan nasal spray 20 mg, 10 mg, or placebo (2:1:1) for the acute treatment of a single migraine attack at home. Predose and at predetermined postdose intervals, patients recorded headache severity (none, mild, moderate, severe); time to meaningful relief; clinical disability (none, mildly impaired, severely impaired, bed rest required); presence/absence of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia; and the occurrence of adverse events. Two hours postdose in the two studies, moderate or severe baseline pain was reduced to mild or none in 62 to 63% of patients treated with sumatriptan 20 mg, 43 to 54% of patients treated with sumatriptan 10 mg, and 29 to 35% of placebo-treated patients (p < 0.05 20 mg versus placebo for both studies and 10 mg versus placebo for study 1). Onset of relief relative to placebo began as early as 15 minutes postdose(sumatriptan 20 mg, study 2). Clinical disability at 2 hours postdose was reported as mildly impaired or normal in 72 to 74% of patients treated with sumatriptan 20 mg, 56 to 68% of patients treated with sumatriptan 10 mg, and 47 to 58% of placebo-treated patients (p < 0.05 20 mg versus placebo for both studies). Similar efficacy rates were observed for nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. The most common adverse event in the active treatment groups was disturbance of taste (bad, bitter, or unpleasant taste). Aside from this event, the pattern and incidence of adverse events did not differ among treatment groups. From these results we determined that sumatriptan nasal spray is a rapidly effective, well-tolerated migraine treatment. The 20-mg dose was effective in treating the entire migraine symptom complex, and the 10-mg dose was less consistently effective.", "outbound_citations": ["7644079", "7644080", "7644082", "7987510", "8200027", "8200026", "8258424", "1563447", "1851894", "1653140", "1653137"], "inbound_citations": ["35896930", "32739524", "32579251", "30877622", "30215543", "29878341", "28605258", "28251391", "28942578", "27078039", "25597782", "26840902"], "label": "1"}

Data from a randomized, open-label extension study were collected over 3 months. Migraineurs were randomized to either rizatriptan (5HT1B/1D receptor agonist) or their usual migraine therapy. Data were analyzed from 164 patients who experienced at least one work-related migraine. Internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1) for the work difficulty domains ranged from 0.80 to 0.95.

Patients: Fifty-one (51) patients who responded to a media campaign, had previously been diagnosed by their family physicians, and who met International Headache Society (IHS) criteria for episodic cluster headache, formed the population for this study. Methods: The media campaign consisted of newspaper advertisements and radio publicity including physician interviews and talk shows. Patients were required to complete a 200-item questionnaire detailing clinical features and treatment of their cluster headache syndrome. Each patient was also interviewed by our research nurse for clarification and proper completion of questionnaire. Results: Fifty-one percent (51%) of our patients had short headache attacks lasting one hour or less. Almost one-half (45%) had three or four attacks per 24 hour period. Eighty-six percent (86%) had been referred to a neurologist. Sixty-nine percent (69%) had never used oxygen, but of those who had, onehalf were still using it. Sumatriptan by injection had been tried by 26% of patients and of these, 93% considered it effective. Subcutaneous dihydroergotamine had been tried by 8%. For prophylaxis, 41% had tried methysergide, 31% prednisone, and 4% verapamil. Many patients had been prescribed migraine prophylactic drugs which are ineffective for cluster headache, and some had also undergone dental procedures or nasal and sinus surgeries. Conclusion: Many cluster headache patients had not, to their knowledge, been prescribed or used the best symptomatic and prophylactic treatments for cluster headache. This should be addressed through educational programs and through making up-to-date information on the treatment of cluster headache readily available to physicians and patients.", "outbound_citations": ["8990601", "7676527", "7928324", "8145911", "8103827", "8396833", "8455970", "8382200", "8496062", "1620353", "1518633", "1582837", "1960057", "2020214", "1901762", "2259317", "2234557", "2342665", "2370132", "3180201", "3048700", "3532683", "3885921", "3921490", "6406993"], "inbound_citations": ["32310255", "30632614", "28842974", "25227490", "24723673", "22077836", "22286556", "21083557"], "label": "0"}

Our open, prospective clinical study was performed at the outpatient department of a Swedish university clinic. There were 19 male and one female subjects, 34 to 68 years old, suffering from cluster headache. We measured the subcutaneous tissue depth by ultrasound. Subjects performed four self-injections of sumatriptan, two in the thigh and two in the gluteal area. We evaluated the subcutaneous tissue depth from the skin surface to the muscle fascia, the effect on headache, side effects, and patient preference regarding the injection site. Subcutaneous tissue depth laterally in the thigh was 2 to 12 mm (median, 4 mm) and in the gluteal area was 34 to 68 mm (median, 45 mm). The needle of the self-injector protrudes 5 to 6 mm. Forty thigh and 39 gluteal injections were recorded. The effect on headache was equal. Following injection in thigh the patients experienced more bleeding (p < 0.001, \u03c72); local pain(p < 0.05, \u03c72); and a feeling of oppression in the head, neck, and chest area (p < 0.05, \u03c72) compared with injections in the gluteal area. Fifteen patients preferred the gluteal area as the injection site after the study, two patients had no preference, and three preferred the thigh. When using the self-injector in the lateral aspect of the thigh, intramuscular injection is liable to occur frequently in male patients. This may explain the differences in local and general side effects observed in this study. The upper lateral quadrant of the gluteal area is a more suitable injection site for male, and some female, patients when using the sumatriptan self-injector.", "outbound_citations": ["7986182", "7851052", "7843948", "7835381", "8093323", "2200543", "3276476", "3087555", "3080045", "7088101"], "inbound_citations": ["25255732", "21999176", "21107827"], "label": "0"}

Patients were aged 18-65 years and had at least a 6 months history of atypical facial pain. A total of 19 patients were recruited and assessed for pain scores (total, sensory and affective) by using a short form McGill pain questionnaire preinjection and and at 60 and 120 minutes after subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan (6 mg) or placebo. Safety and tolerability was assessed by recording adverse events during and after the injection. One patient received only one treatment since her pain symptoms resolved after the first treatment. Rest of the patients returned to the clinic 3-6 weeks later and received alternate treatment for atypical facial pain in the same fashion as on the first occasion. Treatment of patients with sumatriptan produced significant relief in sensory, affective and total pain at 120 minutes postinjection (P < .05). Sumatriptan failed to produce a significant reduction in sensory and total pain scores at 60 minutes following treatment, however the result was statistically significant for the affective pain score (P < .05). No death or other serious adverse events were reported. No patient was withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event. However, all the patients treated with sumatriptan experienced one or more adverse events. The most common reported adverse symptoms during the sumatriptan treatment period were injection site reactions, headache, feeling of heaviness, warm or hot sensation and disorders of mouth or tongue. However, most of these side effects were mild and transient. In conclusion, this study points towards some beneficial effect of a single subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan in the treatment of atypical facial pain.

After treating another three attacks, they were again allowed to adjust the dose by one level.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter migraine attack 3, 37% of patients chose to continue with the 50 mg dose, 50% increased the dose to 100 mg, and 12% decreased it to 25 mg. After attack 6, 8%, 33%, and 58% of patients chose the 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg doses, respectively; only 3% of those taking the 100 mg dose chose to reduce it. Overall, the mean percentages of attacks per patient in which headache relief had been obtained 4 h after dosing were 71%, 71%, and 80% for the 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg doses, respectively. Patients who decreased the dose to 25 mg after attack 3 experienced decreases both in adverse events and percentage of attacks with headache relief, whereas in those who increased the dose to 100 mg, likelihood of headache relief increased but the incidence of adverse events did not.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMore patients chose the 50 mg or 100 mg dose than the 25 mg dose.

This is one of several explanations for there being so few well-designed, randomized, double-blind clinical trials in cluster headache. The standard treatment of acute attacks of cluster headache is inhalation of 100% oxygen. In the prophylaxis of episodic cluster headache, ergotamine, verapamil, lithium, serotonin inhibitors and steroids are used. In chronic cluster, lithium is the drug of choice, but verapamil may also be tried. Recently, hyperbaric oxygen has been shown to immediately abort acute attacks, and it seems that it may also be useful in the prophylactic treatment. The introduction of the novel 5HT1 agonist sumatriptan as a symptomatic relief of cluster attacks represents further significant progress. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trials have shown sumatriptan 6 mg sc to be a rapid, effective and well-tolerated acute treatment for cluster headache attacks. Within 15 min of treatment, 74% of attacks on sumatriptan responded compared to 26% of placebo-treated attacks. Functional disability was also significantly improved. Increasing the dose to 12 mg did not offer significantly greater relief compared to sumatriptan 6 mg, but was associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Interim analysis of 3 months of data from a recent multinational open trial comprising 138 patients having treated 6353 attacks with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg revealed a headache relief in 96% of attacks treated. There was no evidence of an increased incidence of adverse events with frequent use of sumatriptan. No tachyphylaxis was seen over the 3 months, suggesting that sumatriptan is effective and well tolerated also in long-term acute treatment for cluster headache.", "outbound_citations": ["27731711", "7515383", "8374940", "8396833", "8096565", "1326405", "2020214", "2205598", "2507161", "2520386", "2708046", "3908400", "3885921", "6409415", "7021473", "721451", "845021", "1097222", "4391566", "14145382", "13707730", "14446408", "20891133"], "inbound_citations": ["30336190", "30221765", "26635477", "22670710", "21453326"], "label": "1"}

Although the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan nasal spray are documented, the consistency of response to sumatriptan nasal spray across patient subgroups and migraine subtypes of importance to the prescribing clinician have not been described. To provide this information, data from four randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies (Glaxo Wellcome protocol numbers S2B-340, S2B-341, S2B-342, and S2B-T50), conducted between January 1993 and December 1994, were pooled and retrospectively analyzed to determine whether the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan nasal spray vary with gender, ethnic origin, age, weight, migraine type, concomitant or prior medication use, or pretreatment headache duration. Two-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninety-five (2395) patients treated a moderate or severe migraine with study medication in the four studies. The results demonstrate that sumatriptan nasal spray 20 mg and 10 mg were effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment of migraine consistently across a variety of patient and migraine subgroups. No clinically significant differences in headache relief or adverse event rates were observed for any of the subgroups examined. Approximately two-thirds of patients treated with sumatriptan nasal spray 20 mg compared with approximately one-third of placebo-treated patients reported headache relief 2 h postdose regardless of patient or migraine subgroup.

For each migraine, patients recorded migraine pain severity (none, mild, moderate, or severe) before treatment and 2 hours posttreatment and the time until onset of patient-defined meaningful relief. Patients also completed both the Short Form-36 Health Survey and Migraine-specific Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire at screening (to cover the period prior to initiation of treatment) and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Patients' medical records were reviewed to obtain information on the frequency of migraine-related pharmacy use, general outpatient services, and urgent care services during the treatment period and the 12 months prior to initiation of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBy 2 hours after the dose, 71% of patients had moderate or severe pain reduced to mild or none, and 86% of patients achieved meaningful relief. At 3 months and 6 months, sumatriptan was associated with improvements relative to pre-sumatriptan baselines in Short Form-36 Health Survey and Migraine-specific QOL Questionnaire scores (P < .002). Sumatriptan was also associated with significant reductions in the average number of migraine-related general outpatient and urgent care services (P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of sumatriptan for 6 months was associated with improvements in health-related quality of life, reductions in health care resource use, and a high percentage of treatment successes.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["30106172"], "label": "1"}

Zolmitriptan acts both centrally and peripherally, therefore it is important to assess central nervous system effects. At single doses of 25-50 mg (up to 8 times the likely therapeutic dose), zolmitriptan can cause sedation; therefore, a study was designed to examine the dose-response. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, six-limb crossover study in 13 healthy volunteers compared the effects of single oral doses of zolmitriptan (5, 10, 15 or 20 mg) and lorazepam (2 mg) on various psychometric tests. Zolmitriptan doses less than 20 mg had no statistically significant effects on choice reaction time, the Stroop test, visual analog scale (VAS) assessments of physical sedation, tranquilization and other types of feelings, the logical reasoning test or the adaptive tracking test. There was a mild transient increase in the subjective assessment on VAS of mental sedation which was dose related and occurred mainly with the highest zolmitriptan dose and were not reflected in objective measures of drug effects. In contrast, lorazepam (used as a positive control) was associated with statistically significant impairment in all tests (except tranquilization) for up to 10 h after dosing.

Recently launched (naratriptan and zolmitriptan) triptans with enhanced lipophilicity (TEL) may theoretically reduce central 5-HT levels, potentially exacerbating depressive illness. The aim of this study was to compare depressive illness patient consulting rates (PCR) between the newer triptans and sumatriptan treated patients. Migraine-diagnosed patients were identified from the West Midlands General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between age, sex, migraine duration, prior depression, prior and current triptan medication and the current PCR for depression. Of a total patient database of 642 000 patients 21 331 (3.3%) had a diagnosis of migraine. From 1993 to 1997, sumatriptan-treated migraineurs had significantly higher depression PCRs (22.3%) compared with non-triptan users (19.3%), a difference of 6.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6\u20138.4%, P < 0.001). In the year (April 1997 to March 1998) following the launch of the TELs, depression PCRs were significantly higher among patients using these compounds compared with sumatriptan-treated patients (5.1%, CI 1.8\u201312.0%, P < 0.05). However, after taking account of prior depression (odds ratio (OR) 6.45, 95% CI 3.63\u201311.43), TELs were not significantly associated with depression (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03\u20132.13). Furthermore, rates of newly diagnosed depression after treatment were similar in the two triptan groups (sumatriptan 4.2%; TELs 3.9%). Although, the TELs are being prescribed to patients with higher pre-existing rates of depression, they are not associated with subsequently increased consulting for depressive illness compared with patients taking sumatriptan. This study highlights the potential to use GPRD to test targeted hypotheses exploring pharmacovigilance issues for patients using new medicines.", "outbound_citations": ["9793713", "9572087", "9489518", "9453273", "10213569", "9218880", "9169967", "7591744", "7566468", "7782482", "7714232", "7928322", "7984277", "8343670", "8395298"], "inbound_citations": ["34962845"], "label": "0"}

The present study, carried out according to a double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled design, included 15 CH patients, six with episodic CH (mean \u00b1\u200asd age of 36.8 \u00b1 5.6 years), and nine with chronic CH (37.8 \u00b1 10.4 years). Patients had undergone a standard NTG test (0.9 mg sublingually), during which the intensity of pain was scored using a visuo\u2010analogic scale (VAS, range 0\u201310). Nine patients (two with the episodic form, seven with the chronic form) experienced a typical, spontaneous\u2010like attack on the usual side, occurring in all cases within 45 min. In these patients, the test was repeated with an interval of 2 days, and once pain intensity reached 5 on the VAS, a 10% solution of cocaine hydrochloride (1 ml, mean amount per application 40\u201350 mg), or 10% lidocaine (1 ml), or saline was applied using a cotton swab in the area corresponding to the sphenopalatine fossa, under anterior rhinoscopy.

Eleven adult patients with autism or Asperger's disorder were randomized to single dose sumatriptan (6 mg SQ) and placebo challenges, separated by a one-week interval. In adult autistic disorders, severity of repetitive behaviors at baseline, as measured by YBOCS-compulsion score, significantly positively correlated with both peak delta growth hormone response and area under the curve growth hormone response to sumatriptan.

The males had more migraine alone while the females had migraine often with a coexistent tension-type headache. Eighty percent of all the patients had some adverse event which was usually mild and transient; however, one patient developed a transitory confusional state which resolved in 2 hours.

Some case reports suggest that even the new serotonergic antimigraine drugs such as sumatriptan can lead to overuse and subsequent drug-induced headache. We performed a controlled study to identify the rate of sumatriptan overuse and sumatriptan-induced headache and compared it to the rate of ergotamine overuse and ergotamine-induced headache. Two thousand sixty-five consecutive heachache patients, all experienced in intake of sumatriptan (n = 631) or ergotamine (n = 620), were enrolled over a three-year study period. The rates of overuse and drug-induced headache and the clinical features of the subgroups were compared. Risk factors for sumatriptan overuse were identified. The rates of ergotamine and sumatriptan overuse were 14.2% and 3.5%, respectively (p < 0.001). Drug-induced headache could be found more frequently in cases of ergotamine overuse than in cases of sumatriptan overuse (68% versus 32%; p < 0.01). Development of sumatriptan overuse was most common in patients with previous drug-induced headache (68%), combined headache as the primary headache type (45%), and subcutaneous application of sumatriptan (45%). We conclude that sumatriptan intake can lead to overuse and subsequent drug-induced headache. The risk for overuse and drug-induced headache is significantly lower than in patients with ergotamine intake. This might be caused in part by the relatively short period of sumatriptan availability on the market. The new generation of serotonin-1B/D-receptor agonists in the treatment of headache should have a potential for overuse similar to that of traditional headache drugs.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34852073", "33290608", "24662044", "23968886", "28360580", "23444078", "24654726", "20298963"], "label": "1"}

Besides a small difference in age, there were no differences in basic characteristics between cases and controls. Three cases had ST-depression on ECG during exercise. However, none of the variables measured during exercise testing differed significantly between cases and controls.

These conditions involve central and peripheral physiological changes, together with psychological factors. Methodological problems have included a poor appreciation of the physiological and psychological correlates of patients' symptoms, a lack of animal models of proven relevance, and safety issues. Government, patient pressure groups and the Internet can also influence a drug's success. Most recent interest has focused on the serotonin (5\u2010HT) modifying drugs. Cisapride has been withdrawn in some countries because of concerns related to QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. The 5\u2010HT3 antagonists, developed to modify visceral sensation, have caused constipation; alosetron, also withdrawn, caused ischaemic colitis. The 5\u2010HT4 agonists induce peristalsis; tegaserod and prucalopride, both delayed in their development due to issues of safety and efficacy, benefit patients with `constipation\u2010predominant' irritable bowel syndrome or idiopathic constipation. 5\u2010HT1 agonists improve impaired gastric accommodation and symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia. Antidepressants also affect serotonin metabolism. Previous examples of success in this area involved drugs targeted at peripheral receptors mediating motor function or secretion. Modification of sensory function is a much more challenging objective. The experience with serotonin modifying drugs has been mixed, and some important lessons are there to be learnt.", "outbound_citations": ["9952218", "11207504", "11122591", "10915117", "10744088", "10588173", "10555586", "10429737", "10429740", "10209681", "9782031", "9768527", "9641384", "9616313", "10027671", "8913711", "16844018", "7986965", "7986966", "6319244"], "inbound_citations": ["33845366", "32978480", "31299593", "30590198", "35520180", "26548544", "24590579", "12678573", "20353496"], "label": "0"}

Despite the use of prophylactic medication, such as propranolol, breakthrough attacks often occur in patients. Consequently we investigated the effects of propranolol on the pharmacokinetics of, and cardiovascular responses to, zolmitriptan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA double-blind, randomized, crossover study of the effects of pre-treatment with propranolol 160 mg daily for 7 days or placebo on the pharmacokinetics and effects on blood pressure of a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan in 12 healthy volunteers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPropranolol increased mean zolmitriptan Cmax and AUC by 56% and 37% respectively; mean t1/2 was prolonged from 3.1 to 4.0 h. Mean Cmax and AUC of the pharmacologically active N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 24% and 11% respectively and the metabolite:parent AUC ratio (AUCm/AUCp) fell from 0.46 to 0.26. Mean Cmax and AUC for the inactive indole acetic acid metabolite were both reduced by 13% and AUCm/AUCp from 1.04 to 0.59. A small pressor effect of short duration was observed following zolmitriptan with mean peak rises of 13 and 11 mmHg in systolic and diastolic pressures respectively; propranolol had no effect on the pressor response.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results suggest that propranolol inhibits biotransformation of zolmitriptan but with no change in the small pressor response to zolmitriptan. It is therefore unlikely that the pharmacokinetic changes will lead to clinically important changes in pharmacological effects and dosage adjustment of zolmitriptan is not required in patients taking propranolol for migraine prophylaxis.", "outbound_citations": ["2776391", "2860914", "237749"], "inbound_citations": ["33730376", "33003955", "32286940", "31950732", "26865407", "25676133", "23341903"], "label": "0"}

This was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, 1-year, multiple-attack study. Adolescents (aged 12-17 years) with a > or =6-month history of migraine with or without aura, 2 to 8 moderate or severe migraines per month, and a typical migraine duration of > or =4 hours were eligible for participation. After initial treatment with sumatriptan 10 mg, the dose could be adjusted down to 5 mg or up to 20 mg at the investigator's discretion to optimize tolerability or efficacy. Patients could treat an unlimited number of moderate or severe migraine attacks, provided there was a 24-hour headache-free period between treated attacks and a 2-hour period between doses of sumatriptan NS. A second dose of sumatriptan NS was available for headache recurrence 2 to 24 hours after initial treatment; no more than 2 doses could be used within a 24-hour period. Adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiographic and physical findings, and laboratory variables were assessed. Headache response (reduction of moderate/severe predose pain to mild/no pain) and pain-free response (reduction of moderate/severe predose pain to no pain) were reported by patients 2 hours after dosing. A total of 437 patients treated > or =1 migraine; 3272 total attacks were treated, with 3675 drug exposures (mean, 1.1 dose/attack). Patients had a mean age of 14.1 years, 91% were white, and 53% were female. Seven patients used the 5-mg dose; meaningful conclusions concerning this dose could not be made. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 33% of attacks with the 10-mg dose and 31% with the 20-mg dose; most were related to taste disturbance. Adverse events did not increase with a second dose or over time. Four percent (16/437) of patients withdrew due to drug-related adverse events. One serious adverse event, a facial-nerve ischemic event (10-mg dose), was considered drug related. No drug-related changes in vital signs or electrocardiographic findings were observed. Headache response 2 hours after dosing was reported by 76% of patients taking the 10-mg dose and 72% of those taking the 20-mg dose. Pain-free response 2 hours after dosing was reported by 43% and 40% of patients in the 10- and 20-mg groups, respectively. Based on these results, sumatriptan NS at doses of 10 and 20 mg was well tolerated and effective in the 1-year treatment of multiple migraine attacks in adolescents.", "outbound_citations": ["11061765", "10099852", "10209349", "9596457", "9371898", "7672958", "1525799", "3282670", "3334199", "5850461"], "inbound_citations": ["31563234", "30526161", "30074552", "27858938", "26968976", "26788131", "25881677", "25754176", "25617222", "23359002", "23255042", "23013035", "22500646", "21797863", "21375444", "21028917", "20420446", "20842580"], "label": "1"}

A multidisciplinary panel of six judges produced an initial version of the instrument. Fourteen raters from three different backgrounds assessed the quality of 36 research reports in pain research, selected from three different samples. Seven were allocated randomly to perform the assessments under blind conditions. The final version of the instrument included three items. These items were scored consistently by all the raters regardless of background and could discriminate between reports from the different samples. Blind assessments produced significantly lower and more consistent scores than open assessments.

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study. Patients received either naratriptan tablets (1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10 mg), sumatriptan tablets (100 mg), or placebo. A total of 643 patients took part in the study. Two hours after dosing, headache relief was reported by significantly more patients treated with any dose of naratriptan (52%-69%) or sumatriptan (60%) than with placebo (31%) (P < 0.05). Four hours after dosing, headache relief was reported by significantly more patients treated with any dose of naratriptan (63%-80%) or sumatriptan (80%) than with placebo (39%) and by significantly more patients treated with sumatriptan 100 mg (80%) than with naratriptan 1 mg (64%), 2.5 mg (63%), or 5 mg (65%) (P < 0.05). Twenty-four-hour overall efficacy (headache relief maintained through 24 hours postdose with no worsening, no use of rescue medication, and no recurrence) was reported by more patients treated with any dose of naratriptan (39%-58%) or sumatriptan (44%) than with placebo (22%). Headache recurrence was reported in 17% to 32% of naratriptan-treated patients, 44% of sumatriptan-treated patients, and 36% of placebo recipients. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in patients treated with naratriptan 1 mg (20%), naratriptan 2.5 mg (21%), and placebo (23%). For naratriptan 5, 7.5, and 10 mg, the incidence of adverse events was 32%, 37%, and 35%, respectively, and for sumatriptan 100 mg it was 26%. Our results suggest that the 2.5-mg dose of naratriptan tablets offers the optimal efficacy-to-tolerability ratio at the dose range between 1 and 10 mg.

The results were compared to results obtained from studies of nitrate tolerance in healthy subjects. Materials and methods:\u20035\u2010isosorbide\u2010mononitrate (5\u2010ISMN) 30 mg was administered orally three times daily for 4 weeks in nine sufferers of chronic cluster headache in a double\u2010blind, randomized placebo\u2010controlled cross\u2010over design. Blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery was measured with transcranial Doppler and the diameters of the temporal and radial arteries were measured with high frequency ultrasound. The haemodynamic data were compared to changes in the frequency of cluster headache attacks and interval headaches over time. Results: Tolerance was complete within 24 h in the middle cerebral arteries and after 7 days in the symptomatic temporal artery, while tolerance of the radial artery was not observed within this period. The time profiles of tolerance were almost identical to the time profiles observed in healthy subjects. A close temporal association between the disappearance of nitrate\u2010induced headache and tolerance of the temporal artery was observed but tolerance had no effect on cluster headache attack frequency. Conclusions: Induction of tolerance to nitrates cannot be used to treat cluster headache. If pain is related to arterial dilatation the results point to extracerebral rather than cerebral arteries as the site of nociception.

Number of patients taking the study drug, length of the trial, and type of control.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe number of trials varied substantially.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way, cross-over study was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers. According to a randomly assigned allocation schedule, subjects were administered sumatriptan 3 mg, sumatriptan 6 mg or placebo subcutaneously. Measurements were performed at baseline, every 5 min for 30 min and at 40 min and 60 min after drug administration. SBP and DBP were recorded using a semi-automated oscillometric device. DHV diameter was measured using a linear variable differential transformer. DeltaSBP(toe-arm) was calculated after measuring toe and arm SBP with a strain-gauge technique. Sensitivity was evaluated with responsiveness statistics. Based on weighted mean and compared with placebo, sumatriptan 3 mg and 6 mg increased SBP by 3.3 mmHg ( P=0.023) and 6.4 mmHg ( P<0.001) and DBP by 5.0 mmHg ( P=0.006) and 7.5 mmHg ( P<0.001), respectively. Sumatriptan 3 mg and 6 mg decreased DHV diameter by 36% ( P=0.015) and 40% ( P=0.005), respectively. DeltaSBP(toe-arm) did not change. Peak changes were observed within 10-15 min after drug administration. The rank order of responsiveness was: BP > DHV diameter > DeltaSBP(toe-arm.) Clinically relevant doses of subcutaneous sumatriptan increased blood pressure and decreased DHV diameter without affecting DeltaSBP(toe-arm).

AIMS To investigate the effect of sumatriptan, an agonist at enteric neuronal 5-HT1receptors, on fasting fundus tone and sensitivity to gastric distension in man. METHODS A gastric barostat was used to study the effect of placebo and sumatriptan, 6 mg subcutaneously, on basal fundic tone in healthy subjects. In addition, stepwise isobaric and isovolumetric gastric distensions were performed and perception was measured before and after the administration of placebo and sumatriptan. RESULTS Placebo had no significant effects on gastric tone and on perception. Sumatriptan induced an immediate relaxation of the gastric fundus, reflected by an intragastric volume increase of 209 (39) ml (p<0.0005). After sumatriptan, intragastric pressures at the thresholds for perception or discomfort were not significantly altered. However, the intragastric volumes and the corresponding calculated wall tensions at perception and discomfort thresholds were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS Administration of the 5-HT1 receptor agonist sumatriptan induces a relaxation of the gastric fundus in man, allowing larger intragastric volumes before thresholds for perception or discomfort are reached. The effects of sumatriptan on the gastric fundus may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of patients with functional dyspepsia.", "outbound_citations": ["10220495", "29597701", "9834261", "29590771", "9315919", "8959733", "8566616", "7797033", "7672673", "7835573", "7926499", "7986965", "8020671", "7938165", "1476191", "1379152", "1889724", "1675430", "2166920", "2782410", "2888879", "3789139", "3979436", "4383454", "9486164", "9950810", "1985006", "7506394"], "inbound_citations": ["36555276", "35156893", "34337824", "34362210", "33615630", "33284255", "32515018", "31203636", "30298964", "30139887", "29119636", "28970332", "28695632", "27927062", "27535977", "27588061", "26399958", "26603880", "26507073", "26303048", "26342014", "25677141", "25097003", "25403777", "24891930", "24627564", "24341686", "24574708", "24143125", "23702005", "23458851", "23489975", "22989081", "22813445", "22807611", "22050410", "22783191", "21916991", "22438071", "23155802", "21575632", "12678573", "22189089", "21902766", "21659472", "21517922", "21992252", "23251744", "20979591", "21350319", "20884888", "21118281", "21180597"], "label": "0"}

In order to evaluate the potential role of statins as immunomodulators in MS, the authors studied their immunologic effects in vitro and compared them to interferon (IFN)&bgr;-1b. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from untreated or IFN&bgr;-1\u2013treated patients with relapsing-remitting MS or from healthy donors (HD) and T cells were stimulated with concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, or antibody to CD3 in the presence of lovastatin, simvastatin, mevastatin, IFN&bgr;-1b, or statins plus IFN&bgr;-1b. The authors analyzed proliferative activity of T cells and B cells, cytokine production and release, activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and surface expression of activation markers, adhesion molecules, and chemokine receptors on both T and B cells. Results All three statins inhibited proliferation of stimulated PBMC in a dose-dependent manner, with simvastatin being the most potent, followed by lovastatin and mevastatin. IFN&bgr;-1b showed a similar effect; statins and IFN&bgr;-1b together added their inhibitory potentials. Furthermore, statins reduced the expression of activation-induced adhesion molecules on T cells, modified the T helper 1/T helper 2 cytokine balance, reduced MMP-9, and downregulated chemokine receptors on both B and T cells. Besides strong anti-inflammatory properties, statins also exhibited some proinflammatory effects.

Almost twice as many patients preferred rizatriptan 10-mg rapidly disintegrating tablet to sumatriptan 50-mg tablet (64.3 vs. 35.7%, p \u2264 0.001). Faster relief of headache pain was the most important reason for the preference, cited by 46.9% of patients preferring rizatriptan and 43.4% of patients who preferred sumatriptan. Headache relief at 2 h was 75.9% with rizatriptan and 66.6% with sumatriptan (p \u2264 0.001), with rizatriptan being superior to sumatriptan within 30 min of dosing. Fifty-five percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan, compared with 42.1% treated with sumatriptan (p \u2264 0.001), rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment. Forty-one percent of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication, compared to 32.3% of patients on sumatriptan. Rizatriptan was also superior to sumatriptan in terms of the proportions of patients with no nausea, phonophobia or photophobia, and patients with normal function 2 h after treatment intake (p < 0.05).

The first of the class, sumatriptan, and the newer triptans (zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, almotriptan and frovatriptan) display high agonist activity at mainly the serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor subtypes. As expected for a class of compounds developed for affinity at a specific receptor, there are minor pharmacodynamic differences between the triptans. Sumatriptan has a low oral bioavailability (14%) and all the newer triptans have an improved oral bioavailability and for one, risatriptan, the rate of absorption is faster. The half-lives of naratriptan, eletriptan and, in particular, frovatriptan (26 to 30h) are longer than that of sumatriptan (2h). These pharmacokinetic improvements of the newer triptans so far seem to have only resulted in minor differences in their efficacy in migraine. Double-blind, randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the different triptans and triptans with other medication should ideally be the basis for judging their place in migraine therapy. In only 15 of the 83 reported RCTs were 2 triptans compared, and in 11 trials triptans were compared with other drugs. Therefore, in all placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials, the relative efficacy of the triptans was also judged by calculating the therapeutic gain (i.e. percentage response for active minus percentage response for placebo). The mean therapeutic gain with subcutaneous sumatriptan 6mg (51%) was more than that for all other dosage forms of triptans (oral sumatriptan 100mg 32%; oral sumatriptan 50mg 29%: intranasal sumatriptan 20mg 30%; rectal sumatriptan 25mg 31%; oral zolmitriptan 2.5mg 32%; oral rizatriptan 10mg 37%; oral eletriptan 40mg 37%; oral almotriptan 12.5mg 26%). Compared with oral sumatriptan 100mg (32%), the mean therapeutic gain was higher with oral eletriptan 80mg (42%) but lower with oral naratriptan 2.5mg (22%) or oral frovatriptan 2.5mg (16%). The few direct comparative randomised clinical trials with oral triptans reveal the same picture. Recurrence of headache within 24 hours after an initial successful response occurs in 30 to 40% of sumatriptan-treated patients. Apart from naratriptan, which has a tendency towards less recurrence, there appears to be no consistent difference in recurrence rates between the newer triptans and sumatriptan. Rizatriptan with its shorter time to maximum concentration (tmax) tended to produce a quicker onset of headache relief than sumatriptan and zolmitriptan. The place of triptans compared with non-triptan drugs in migraine therapy remains to be established and further RCTs are required.", "outbound_citations": ["9439085", "1653139", "7954759", "9748025", "9384509", "8622623", "10972633", "10385240", "8757005", "8879897", "9350383", "8791240", "1317294", "10210876", "9563208", "9542478", "8710123", "8397070", "9149537", "8991488", "9144644", "8536304", "9071266", "9243618", "9371898", "9170336", "7843948", "8536293", "10376168", "9203569", "7710149", "9088582", "9601622", "9700983", "9865528", "9596457", "9058395", "1653135", "8550361", "9203565", "9056052", "9563207", "9588435", "7644080", "1379152", "10817444", "7644049", "1333181", "9205951", "10210888", "9827244", "1653138", "8381056", "11284463", "8394239", "1322512", "9350384", "7928323", "8912486", "9154322", "9718276", "7768259", "2142096", "8791027", "10631625", "9795022", "9409334", "2542039", "12722735", "10099848", "3758146", "1851894", "9489607", "9563211", "8951929", "7585925", "9673807", "1653136", "9750007", "9150621", "8935482", "8639069", "8164015", "9617601", "1647495", "7693489", "9371897", "7501338", "7644079", "7964913", "9595867", "9745358", "9399015", "11284462", "9395253", "1681162", "8904614", "2544280", "9225277", "10209349", "15992122", "9665056", "1665260", "11563413", "7936279", "7564725", "8916559", "1889975", "10972634", "8614525", "1329294", "9117091", "7828190", "10692717", "8967979", "10692718", "9209775", "9371896", "10448545", "7435199", "9865508", "7644082", "15992000", "8393474", "10193663", "8933995", "1653137", "9268233", "8262783", "9679775", "8390743", "11284464", "1653140", "9153607", "8733580", "9833595", "1676084", "10954953", "9209776", "7630480", "7516861", "9051334", "7697699", "9536565", "8388188", "8392150"], "inbound_citations": ["36918752", "36414952", "36224519", "36000114", "34535065", "34275352", "34447267", "33105176", "30596919", "30596960", "30596955", "30596937", "30596928", "28920449", "29563831", "28880380", "29019093", "27919795", "28101470", "27777567", "27613076", "27503180", "27075428", "27091045", "26848128", "26865407", "26788131"], "label": "0"}

If the patients satisfied the criteria for migraine, they were given subcutaneous sumatriptan for treating three migraine attacks. The patients were able to use the study medication under outpatient conditions. The therapeutic efficacy of the medicine was recorded in a headache diary. A total of 91 patients were included in the study at 22 practices in Germany. An average of four patients per practice were recruited. In the first migraine attack treated, headache improvement was experienced by 77.7% of the patients treated. In the second and third attacks an improvement was experienced by 93.5% and 89.8%, respectively. The results show that by optimizing diagnostic reliability with the aid of the computer program a high response rate can be achieved under practice conditions using the selective serotonin agonist sumatriptan. Since the computer program described permits a specific diagnosis, it improves the prospects of effective headache therapy in the individual patient.

It was seen that both drugs relieved the migrainous pain. However, sumatriptan did so in a greater percentage of patients.\n\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\nThere was earlier, and also more complete, relief of pain in those patients receiving sumatriptan. With regard to side-effects of sumatriptan were pain at the back of the site of injection, sensation of pressure at the back of the neck, facial flushing and asthenia.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["24452560", "23588793", "22336869"], "label": "0"}

However, the SSRIs have been implicated in the development of the serotonin syndrome--a potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with psychotropic drugs. The syndrome is produced most often by the concurrent use of two or more drugs that enhance central nervous system serotonin activity and often goes unrecognized because of the varied and nonspecific nature of its clinical features. The serotonin syndrome is characterized by alterations in cognition (disorientation, confusion), behavior (agitation, restlessness), autonomic nervous system function (fever, shivering, diaphoresis, diarrhea), and neuromuscular (ataxia, hyperreflexia, myoclonus) activity. The difference between this syndrome and the occurrence of adverse effects caused by serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone is the clustering of the signs and symptoms, their severity, and their duration. There are important pharmacokinetic interactions between SSRIs and other serotonergic drugs due principally to their effects on the cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes, the potential for which varies widely amongst the SSRI group, which may increase the likelihood of a pharmacodynamic interaction. The exceptionally long washout period required after fluoxetine discontinuation may cause additional problems and/or inconvenience. Patients with serotonin syndrome usually respond to discontinuation of drug therapy and supportive care alone, but they may also require treatment with antiserotonergic agent such as cyproheptadine, methysergide, and/or propranolol. To reduce the occurrence, morbidity, and mortality of the serotonin syndrome, it must be both prevented by prudent pharmacotherapy and given prompt recognition when it is present.", "outbound_citations": ["8666564", "8681579", "8690828", "8704073", "7491028", "7476638", "8748050", "7475559", "7591744", "8548727", "7662067", "7482685", "7782482", "7713852", "7724720", "7788138", "7836337", "7978579", "7945606", "8084345", "7801990", "8010365", "8010552", "8198316", "7919561", "8195456", "8195463", "8193438", "7905964", "8273987", "8195580", "8294388", "7901695", "8127934", "7902026", "8379573", "8256650", "8227489", "8101947", "8415895", "8094789", "8426445", "8451775", "8443525", "8257462", "8468439", "8356462", "8277153", "8277157", "1306668", "1421659", "1530086", "1327396", "1355567", "1353554", "1356787", "1557493", "1388041", "28421559", "1347361", "1346952", "1659918", "1741813", "1676424", "2035713", "1903237", "2223920", "2119876", "2356884", "2347858", "1971220", "2107954", "2511771", "2492167", "3200286", "2902292", "2451963", "3680605", "2886672", "3631476", "2881002", "2884326", "3488767", "3711372", "3700697", "3874888", "6665091", "6865966", "7037873", "7334144", "20311659", "4917709", "14209383", "14100156", "13730138", "14445706", "14350468"], "inbound_citations": ["36188551", "35279634", "33478760", "33308914", "32308591", "32077266", "32057547", "31419307", "31030620", "31404205", "30141099", "29691274", "28859407", "28594246", "28148614", "27518478", "26425930", "26110802", "24713617", "24175721", "24004848", "24006318", "23785165", "23485557", "23085335", "23533900", "23796482", "23343808", "24358002", "23110654", "22778401", "22752315", "22699544", "22311403", "22447095", "23461451", "22041229", "21776003", "21052868", "20579741", "21565710", "21172578", "21121777", "20522613", "20473072", "20473084", "20172668", "20238197"], "label": "0"}

In vitro studies have suggested that sumatriptan is metabolized primarily by the monoamine oxidase-A isozyme and not by CYP3A4. This study sought to determine the effect of coadministration of clarithromycin dosed to steady state on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of sumatriptan. A secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of combining these agents. This was an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study in healthy volunteers. During treatment period 1, subjects received either a single oral dose of sumatriptan 50 mg (sumatriptan alone) or clarithromycin 500 mg orally every 12 hours on days 1 to 3 and a single oral dose of sumatriptan 50 mg plus a single oral dose of clarithromycin 500 mg on the morning of day 4 (combination treatment). During treatment period 2, they received the alternative regimen. Equivalence between sumatriptan alone and combination treatment was concluded if the 90% CI for the ratio of reference to test means of loge-transformed data for area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(infinity)) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) fell within the interval from 0.8 to 1.25. In the 24 evaluable subjects (12 men, 12 women) included in the pharmacokinetic analysis, mean sumatriptan AUC(infinity) and Cmax values after administration of combination treatment were 9% and 14% higher, respectively, than the corresponding values after administration of sumatriptan alone. The 90% CI for the ratio of reference to test means for AUC(infinity) was 1.03 to 1.15. The 90% CI for the ratio of reference to test means for Cmax was 1.03 to 1.26, above the traditional bioequivalence criterion. All other pharmacokinetic parameters tested, including nonparametric analysis of the time to Cmax, met the criterion for equivalence between treatments. Both treatments were well tolerated in the 27 subjects (13 men, 14 women) included in the safety analysis. The extent of absorption of sumatriptan was similar after oral administration alone and in combination with clarithromycin dosed to steady state. These data are consistent with previous reports that sumatriptan is unaffected by coadministration with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin, supporting concomitant administration of these agents without the need for dose adjustment of sumatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["7768259", "11723269", "10972633", "9617601", "9795022", "9531525", "9455717", "9371896", "9350384", "9066944", "8547740", "7619215", "7851052", "8161354", "8222460", "8408732", "1653135", "4556704"], "inbound_citations": ["36655303", "32133327", "28101470", "26865407", "23018546", "22435741", "21540108"], "label": "0"}

Aims\u2014To study the involvement of a cholinergic pathway in the motor effects of erythromycin using the muscarinic antagonist atropine and the neural 5-HT1receptor agonist sumatriptan. Methods\u2014In 30 healthy volunteers, fasted antroduodenojejunal motor activity was studied by stationary manometry. Placebo (n=10), atropine (15 \u03bcg/kg intravenous bolus plus 15 \u03bcg/kg/h over 30 minutes; n=10), or sumatriptan (6 mg subcutaneously; n=10) was administered, followed by infusion of erythromycin 40 mg or 200 mg. Results\u2014After placebo, erythromycin 40 mg induced a premature activity front with gastric onset after 19.1 (1.7) minutes in all volunteers. After atropine, erythromycin 40 mg failed to induce a premature activity front during a 60 minute period in all volunteers (p<0.001), while sumatriptan prevented the induction of a premature activity front during a 60 minute period in all but one volunteer (p<0.005). The number of antral contractions and their mean amplitude in the 60 minutes after erythromycin 200 mg did not differ significantly after atropine or sumatriptan versus placebo. Conclusions\u2014The antral motor effects of erythromycin in humans are mediated via different pathways. The induction of a premature activity front is mediated through activation of an intrinsic cholinergic pathway, while the induction of enhanced antral contractile activity may be mediated via a pathway potentially involving activation of a muscular receptor.", "outbound_citations": ["9142924", "9038878", "8804083", "7573453", "7797033", "7965757", "8253365", "1302371", "1612359", "1379152", "2395017", "2320062", "2782410", "3231745", "3419153", "3672037", "3817389", "3786836", "6142392", "864008", "2780220", "2782416", "8313822"], "inbound_citations": ["36436612", "35331740", "34504426", "34167901", "33367978", "33044576", "33025716", "30675023", "30789939", "30139887", "29635488", "29720852", "29545633", "28782145", "30385748", "28035532", "29030700", "27179882", "27283792", "26924243", "27062028", "26840446", "26817505", "26770271", "26392067", "26387781", "25986945", "25971881", "25393165", "24627564", "24396182", "23189978", "23962482", "23190027", "23201066", "22946540", "24380989", "22858405", "22616752", "22537158", "22790474", "22450306", "22267599", "22050097", "12678573", "14969571", "22029733", "21701222", "21295944", "21178622", "21927604", "20731779"], "label": "0"}

The current mainstay of surgical intervention for these patients is percutaneous radiofrequency retrogasserian rhizotomy (PRFR). However, when performed for V1 distribution pathology, PRFR can lead to corneal anesthesia, which places the patient at risk for future visual loss. It also increases the risk of facial dysesthesia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a prospective, consecutive series, 18 patients with intractable CH were followed for a mean of 5.2 years (range, 40-78 mo) after they had undergone PRGR, performed using a standard technique. The significance of this technique as an alternative to PRFR is that it should result in a lower rate of both corneal and facial anesthesia and provide an acceptable degree of pain relief.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifteen patients (83%) obtained immediate pain relief after one or two injections; the majority of them experienced relief after the first injection. CH recurred in seven patients (39%) over the course of the study. Two of these patients received a second injection, and both met with equal success. Two other patients underwent PRFR. Excluding those who underwent PRFR, the overall daily headache frequency decreased from 3.5 +/- 0.3 attacks per day preoperatively to 0.6 +/- 0.2 attacks per day at last follow-up. The severity of these headaches, as assessed by verbal pain scales, also decreased from 10 preoperatively to 4.4 +/- 1.4 at follow-up. None of the patients, including those who required a second procedure, experienced corneal anesthesia or facial dysesthesia.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study provides the first long-term evaluation of PRGR for the treatment of medically refractive chronic CH and lends support to both the safety and long-term efficacy of this procedure. Further investigations are needed to compare directly the relative efficacy and safety of PRGR and PRFR.", "outbound_citations": ["7775174", "7505590", "1944829", "2338568", "2338571", "2294185", "3230000", "3261287", "3578462", "3495342", "2423815", "3964115", "4077492", "2858455", "6643037", "6180152", "7322329", "7363058", "5413025", "4988867", "5353635", "5639740", "14274088", "13099458", "20293608"], "inbound_citations": ["35112222", "30535031", "30303584", "27451048"], "label": "0"}

We investigated patients' overall satisfaction with treatment in studies in which direct comparisons with other triptans were made.

There were suggestions that fluoxetine caused more agitation, weight loss and dermatological reactions than the other SSRIs. More patients discontinued fluvoxamine and fewer patients stopped sertraline because of adverse effects than their comparator SSRIs. The most common adverse reactions to the SSRIs were gastrointestinal (especially nausea) and neuropsychiatric (particularly headache and tremor). Data from the Committee on Safety of Medicines showed more reports of suspected reactions (including discontinuation reactions) to paroxetine, and of gastrointestinal reactions to fluvoxamine and paroxetine, than the other SSRIs during their first 2 years of marketing. Prescription-event monitoring revealed a higher incidence of adverse events related to fluvoxamine than its comparators. There were higher incidences of gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, sedation and tremor during treatment with fluvoxamine and of sedation, tremor, sweating, sexual dysfunction and discontinuation reactions with paroxetine. Fluoxetine was not associated with a higher incidence of suicidal, aggressive and related events than the other SSRIs. Patients have survived large overdoses of each of the compounds, but concern has been expressed over 6 fatalities following overdoses of citalopram. Drug interactions mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes are theoretically less likely to occur during treatment with citalopram and sertraline, but there is a sparsity of clinical data to support this. Methodological difficulties and price changes do not allow choice for recommendations on the choice of SSRI based on pharmacoeconomic data. Taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of the methods used to compare drugs, guidelines to the selection of individual SSRIs in clinical practice are proposed. Citalopram should be avoided in patients likely to take overdoses. Fluoxetine may not be the drug of first choice for patients in whom a rapid antidepressant effect is important or for those who are agitated, but it may have advantages over other SSRIs in patients who are poorly compliant with treatment and those who have previously had troublesome discontinuation symptoms. Fluvoxamine, and possibly paroxetine, should not be used as first choice in patients especially prone to SSRI-related adverse reactions, while paroxetine should be avoided if previous discontinuation of treatment was troublesome. When in doubt about the risks of drug interactions, citalopram or sertraline should be considered given the lower theoretical risk of interactions.", "outbound_citations": ["1378369", "7995314", "2523548", "10572324", "9552943", "9537821", "15073748", "9315987", "15073774", "9174567", "9164424", "9098663", "9229033", "9093499", "9055832", "9068931", "9394870", "24926981", "8971432", "8942464", "8918289", "8889909", "8889906", "8709713", "8803650", "8783437", "8861157", "8610817", "7613276", "7603384", "7775364", "7620692", "7622816", "22297235", "7866123", "7622822", "7696728", "7967761", "7993416", "7982260", "8195583", "8195578", "7868844", "8062324", "8106650", "8106654", "7902513", "8103150", "7906658", "8447241", "8263318", "1487205", "1531828", "1464219", "1806630", "1747018", "1890110", "1878265", "2036539", "2016219", "1987466", "1709852", "1998766", "2135165", "2301661", "2324790", "2258381", "2178909", "2530786", "3263876", "3074869", "3203052", "3203063", "3802833", "3749447", "2868361", "3156214", "3156126", "3871766", "6407505", "444788", "747705", "14399272", "9298037", "8835702", "8923094", "3772583", "9274602", "22291290", "7921718"], "inbound_citations": ["37085865", "36575636", "36444151", "35682432", "35370402", "34877286", "34877271", "34449705", "33889537", "32871538", "32843862", "32211986", "31257837", "31078835", "29274375", "28671235", "29204312", "28859218", "28555336", "28064110", "27761973", "27453206"], "label": "0"}

We compared a combination of lysine acetylsalicylate (equivalent to 900 mg aspirin) and 10 mg metoclopramide (LAS+MTC) with oral sumatriptan (100 mg) and placebo in 421 patients with migraine. LAS+MTC was as effective as sumatriptan with a decrease of headache from severe or moderate to mild or none of 57% and 53%, respectively, for the first migraine attack treated. Both treatments were better than placebo (success rate 24%, p < 0.0001). LAS+MTC was significantly more effective in the treatment of nausea than sumatriptan (p < 0.0001) and was better tolerated (adverse events in 18% and 28%, respectively, p < 0.05). LAS+MTC is as effective as sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine attacks.

The Migraine Background Questionnaire (MBQ) was translated and pilot-tested for use in 25 countries. The questionnaire was then self-administered by patients at a screening visit for 3 phase III clinical trials of rizatriptan [a selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist] in 23 US and 78 non-US sites. Persons 18 to 65 years of age with at least a 6-month history of moderate to severe migraines prior to the screening visit were surveyed. A total of 2670 persons (54.7% Europe, 16.5% Latin America, 23.1% North America, 5.5% other countries) completed the MBQ and had responses which could be analysed. On average, each patient reported 2.78 doctor visits, 0.53 emergency room visits and 0.06 hospitalisations related to migraine per year. Patients self-reported being only 46% effective while on the job with migraine symptoms. Extrapolation of patient self-reported work and productivity loss for the last 4 weeks to an annual basis suggested that clinic-based patients with migraine lose 19.5 workday equivalents (8.3 days due to absenteeism, 11.2 days due to reduced workday equivalents) due to migraine per year. In the US, the annual employer cost of this total migraine-related work loss is estimated to be $US3309 (2000 values) per patient with migraine. The levels of self-reported healthcare resources utilised for migraine and work loss were generally consistent across geographic regions. The impact of migraine symptoms on healthcare resource utilisation and work loss was similar across most measures in Europe, Latin America, North America and other countries. Total migraine-related work loss due to absenteeism and reduced workday equivalents accounts for most of the economic burden of migraine, regardless of country, in a clinic-based migraine population.", "outbound_citations": ["10146874", "10146980", "10855344", "10403065", "10219926", "9113602", "8008226", "8008222", "8502385", "1393842"], "inbound_citations": ["36834292", "35774055", "34788304", "32416409", "31511992", "31023226", "29237283", "30198804", "28984356", "28245765", "26553747", "27091495", "26350071", "26752482", "24867830", "23558099", "24367628", "23813744", "23735365", "23565579", "22691905", "22077159", "16277547", "15612831", "22013140", "21187794", "21161301"], "label": "0"}

Nineteen studies were identified, including 10 on the treatment of headache, 3 on diabetic neuropathy, 3 on fibromyalgia, and 3 on mixed-chronic pain.

Its efficacy and tolerability have been assessed in a number of randomised, controlled trials in over 4800 adults with moderate or severe attacks of migraine. Oral almotriptan has a rapid onset of action (significant headache relief is observed 0.5 hours after administration of a 12.5mg dose) and efficacy is sustained in most patients who respond by 2 hours. The drug is significantly more effective than placebo as measured by a number of parameters including 2-hour headache response and pain-free response rates. Other symptoms of migraine, including nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, are also alleviated by almotriptan. The efficacy of oral almotriptan appears to be maintained over repeated doses for multiple attacks of migraine treated over a long period (up to 1 year). High headache response rates were reported over all attacks without tachyphylaxis. For the relief of single attacks of migraine, oral almotriptan 12.5mg had similar efficacy to oral sumatriptan 50mg. Patients given almotriptan report less concern with adverse effects than patients given sumatriptan. The lower incidence of chest pain following treatment with almotriptan than with sumatriptan may lead to a reduction in direct costs, with fewer patients requiring management of chest pain. Almotriptan is well tolerated. Most adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, transient, and generally resolved without intervention or the need for treatment withdrawal. The most common adverse events associated with oral almotriptan 12.5mg treatment were dizziness, paraesthesia, nausea, fatigue, headache, somnolence, skeletal pain, vomiting and chest symptoms. The incidence of adverse events did not differ from placebo and decreased in the longer term. Almotriptan can be coadministered with drugs that share a common hepatic metabolic path; in addition, dosage reduction is required only in the presence of severe renal or hepatic impairment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlmotriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe attacks of migraine in adults. An oral dose of almotriptan 12.5mg has shown greater efficacy than placebo; current data indicate that efficacy is similar to that of oral sumatriptan 50mg, and is maintained in the long term (<or=1 year). Almotriptan has a good adverse event profile and a generally similar overall tolerability profile to sumatriptan; of note, almotriptan is associated with a significantly lower incidence of chest pain than sumatriptan. However, further clinical experience is required to clearly define the place of almotriptan among the other currently available triptans.

The authors have demonstrated previously that ergotamine can lead to a significant reduction of hyperemic myocardial blood flow, but little is known about the effect of the newer serotonin analogues. Coronary artery constriction caused by serotonin or its analogues is mediated mainly by 5HT2 receptors. The selective 5HT1B/1D agonist naratriptan has no significant activity at 5HT2 receptors; however, like all 5HT1B/1D agonists developed for the acute treatment of migraine, naratriptan could potentially constrict coronary arteries by activation of 5HT1B receptors. Methods: The effects on myocardial blood flow of subcutaneous naratriptan 1.5 mg compared with placebo were assessed under resting and hyperemic conditions with PET using oxygen-15 labeled water during two separate visits. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 34 migraine subjects with no evidence of ischemic heart disease, studied outside a migraine attack. Results: Naratriptan did not differ significantly from placebo in its effects on resting myocardial blood flow, but did evoke a small, significant fall in hyperemic myocardial blood flow (\u221213% versus placebo) and an increase in hyperemic coronary resistance (+19% versus placebo) without any signs or symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Naratriptan did not significantly affect the coronary vasodilator reserve (hyperemic/resting blood flow) compared with placebo. Conclusions: These results show that at therapeutic doses, naratriptan exerts only a minor effect on myocardial blood flow, coronary vasodilator reserve, or coronary resistance among subjects with no evidence of ischemic heart disease. These results should not be extrapolated to patients with coronary artery disease, in whom all 5HT1 agonists for migraine are contraindicated.", "outbound_citations": ["9776271", "9665056", "9605061", "9170336", "8190154", "12722735", "2542039", "6786144", "463911"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Eletriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan and zolmitriptan display both increased stability to first pass metabolic inactivation by monoamine oxidase (MAO-A) and enhanced lipophilicity (4- to >> 120-fold more than sumatriptan), leading to increased oral bioavailability (2- to 5-fold more than the 14% reported for oral sumatriptan). Central penetration and increased receptor affinity and selectivity for the neuronal (5-HT1D) receptor also combine to allow for lower total oral dosing (i.e., unit doses of 15 mg or less compared with 50 - 300 mg doses of sumatriptan) and reduced peripheral exposure to the coronary vasoconstrictor (5-HT1B) receptor. The notable exception being eletriptan, where an active P-glycoprotein blood-brain barrier efflux system effectively negates these benefits and requires an 80 mg oral dose. Differences in the metabolic balance between hepatic P450 (especially CYP 1A2) and MAO-A inactivation lead to potential drug interactions for all TELs with the oral contraceptive pill (OCP), fluvoxamine and the quinilone antibiotics (with increased triptan levels). An important but complex MAO-A interaction between a metabolite of propranolol and rizatriptan mandates dosage reduction (to 5 mg) for rizatriptan in the presence of propranolol treatment. There is also an absolute contraindication for the concurrent administration of the MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide and rizatriptan. All the new-marketed TELs have potential clinical benefits and were well-tolerated relative to sumatriptan. Both rizatriptan (10 mg) and zolmitriptan (2.5 mg and 5 mg) demonstrate at least equivalent efficacy to sumatriptan 25, 50 and 100 mg, respectively, making them suitable first line agents for moderate or severe migraine headaches. Rizatriptan has the fastest onset of effect of the TELs. Naratriptan would appear to have lower recurrent headache rate than sumatriptan, rizatriptan or zolmitriptan. Therefore, for headaches of long duration and with a tendency to recur naratriptan may be the most appropriate treatment. Thus, knowledge of the metabolic, pharmacokinetic and clinical profiles of the TELs facilitates the selection of a triptan which allows optimisation of the clinical benefits for individual patients, minimising the risk of drug interactions and a minimally effective dose to reduce potential adverse events (AEs).", "outbound_citations": ["10529545", "10417495", "10362912", "10209344", "11284462", "11284463", "10210876", "9748025", "9700983", "9630786", "9595867", "9563208", "9489518", "9409334", "9371896", "9439085", "9399016", "9350384", "9399014", "9205817", "8951929", "8161354"], "inbound_citations": ["11772292", "34218836", "34056014", "33478538", "22608632"], "label": "0"}

The pharmacology of the head pain systems, as they are known and as they might evolve, are explored in the context of both, the anatomy and physiology of trigeminovascular nociception and in the context of clinical questions, such as those of efficacy, headache recurrence and adverse events.", "outbound_citations": ["11422091", "10636142", "11041768", "11089513", "10611116", "10595285", "10578124", "10570722", "10529545", "10454462", "10422655", "10383528", "10359652", "10338304", "10401552", "10374714", "10445825", "10385247", "10402569", "10214771", "10323584", "10225363", "10217543", "10088651", "10073743", "9879718", "9883001", "9950621", "9865528", "11284463", "10210888", "11284462", "9827244", "10210876", "9665056", "9718276", "9679775", "9632173", "9629840", "9692766", "9696479", "9595868", "9595867", "9489518", "9463456", "9533166", "9484854", "9453271", "9453273", "9409334", "9448572", "9403280", "9399010", "9371896", "9439085", "9362987", "9406883", "9395253", "9350384", "9203569", "9203565", "9243618", "9268233", "9149537", "9220372", "9209774", "9209773", "9154322", "9170336", "9170337", "9109356", "9109924", "9147223", "9225275", "9225278", "9058395", "9371897", "9127118", "9055807", "8955268", "8980858", "8967979", "8933995", "8912486", "8951929", "8951932", "8902256", "8931567", "8824001", "8700126", "8757005", "8710123", "8792039", "8634619", "8628490", "8622623", "8936345", "8614525", "8740609", "8639069", "8624686", "8720594", "8825349", "8581273", "7564725", "8536297", "8564234", "7589183", "7585147", "7630480", "7540279", "7737864", "7697699", "7934431", "8057272", "7921621", "7518321", "7938165", "7910522", "7928323", "8107508", "8287282", "8281439", "7694406", "8395298", "8380639", "8388188", "8102805", "8133429", "8102521", "1324445", "1623506", "1314843", "1374861", "1635891", "1559259", "1647495", "1663596", "1676084", "1653134", "1889975", "2043937", "2036663", "1996883", "1675143", "1653135", "2252337", "1699472", "2250767", "2158835", "2686127", "2776831", "2538184", "2563168", "2454066", "3351579", "3694267", "3497587", "3022150", "3748590", "6604132", "6288930", "6287330", "7281327", "414152", "975705", "4587949", "1113146", "6074748", "5297855", "5325360", "20281940"], "inbound_citations": ["36155770", "36636337", "33840777", "33782592", "32955929", "32662118", "32552657", "32511056", "32447676", "32419007", "31556018", "31291016", "29616830", "29396834", "29202540"], "label": "0"}

Thirty patients were randomly assigned to receive one 16-mg candesartan cilexetil tablet daily in the first treatment period followed by 1 placebo tablet daily in the second period. The remaining 30 received placebo followed by candesartan.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary end point was number of days with headache; secondary end points included hours with headache, days with migraine, hours with migraine, headache severity index, level of disability, doses of triptans, doses of analgesics, acceptability of treatment, days of sick leave, and quality-of-life variables on the Short Form 36 questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn a period of 12 weeks, the mean number of days with headache was 18.5 with placebo vs 13.6 with candesartan (P =.001) in the intention-to-treat analysis (n = 57). Some secondary end points also favored candesartan, including hours with headache (139 vs 95; P<.001), days with migraine (12.6 vs 9.0; P<.001), hours with migraine (92.2 vs 59.4; P<.001), headache severity index (293 vs 191; P<.001), level of disability (20.6 vs 14.1; P<.001) and days of sick leave (3.9 vs 1.4; P =.01), although there were no significant differences in health-related quality of life. The number of candesartan responders (reduction of > or =50% compared with placebo) was 18 (31.6%) of 57 for days with headache and 23 (40.4%) of 57 for days with migraine.

This review covers the past 3 years, which have seen remarkable progress in understanding the pathophysiology of circadian headache syndromes and have brought exciting news.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nAs more cluster headache patients are seen by headache specialists, new forms of this well-defined primary headache syndrome are being identified. In addition, we discuss recent findings with regard to abnormalities in the secretion of hormones, genetic influences, neuroimaging of cluster headache attacks, and the use of newer substances as preventive therapy in cluster headache.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nWe have entered a new diagnostic and therapeutic era in primary headache disorders. In recent reports, the use of deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus has enabled intractable chronic cluster headache patients to be successfully operated upon. Further research in this field is urgently needed and the recent possibility of combining deep brain stimulation with positron emission tomography will certainly help to unravel the brain circuitry implicated in stimulation-produced analgesia. The time has come to use the evidence for a disorder of circadian rhythm in cluster headache to further the development of chronobiotics in the treatment of this disorder.", "outbound_citations": ["1624279", "8965101", "12534580", "12534584", "12534993", "12409185", "12485208", "12485209", "12421159", "12421158", "12453028", "12421162", "12421155", "12390642", "12390632", "12390644", "12230593", "12213616", "12482215", "12056936", "12100085", "11960888", "12100086", "12010390", "12047455", "12047460", "11972589", "11839832", "12005287", "11749882", "11858532", "12005286", "11866398", "11993607", "11993611", "12005276", "23939651", "12195263", "11954875", "11843866", "11843873", "11723209", "11794190", "11903290", "11598494", "11595003", "11342697", "11293599", "11252139", "11252143", "11379270", "11087776", "10971670", "10802793", "10759934", "10998713", "10636152", "10408573", "10395332", "10576887", "10336407", "10329285", "10662931", "10027765", "9793702", "9690407", "9595871", "9514561", "9046719", "9055807", "8933994", "8817538", "8825923", "8536293", "7585147", "7520520", "7518321", "8242722", "8396833", "8395298", "8358775", "8496062", "2027500", "2272093", "2507161", "3074069", "3282670", "3442810", "3652205", "3652203", "3572435", "3768949", "6518501", "6616610", "6850818", "7363058", "721458", "649381", "4204095", "5431456", "4971733"], "inbound_citations": ["28977141", "24512622", "24477598", "22416270", "21054363", "20569084", "19501166"], "label": "0"}

In our view there are fundamental problems, not in the design of the trial, but in the data presentation and the discussion in relation to the other 5HT1B/1D agonists. Headache severity was rated 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after the initial dose of study medication. However, headache relief, a decrease in headache from severe or moderate to none or mild, is only reported at 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours. Readers are told that from 60 minutes both the 1-mg and 2.5-mg dose of naratriptan are significantly better than placebo ( p < 0.001) but no substantiating data are presented. Given what seems to be a trial of very high power, with 586 to 602 patients per group receiving three doses of naratriptan and placebo in a crossover design,10 why are data for the very important early time points not presented when we know that patients value speed of onset?11 Some early time points were presented at the American Academy of Neurology meeting (Boston, 1997), and we ask that the authors provide \u2026", "outbound_citations": ["9489518", "9409334", "9371896", "9071266", "1653138"], "inbound_citations": ["28883259", "27521843", "28616956", "23330402", "22384463", "16097844", "21181425"], "label": "0"}

In a randomized, parallel-group clinical trial, 1246 patients treated one to three migraine attacks (with or without aura) with 100 mg oral sumatriptan.

Methods: This was a placebo controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-finding study. Patients satisfying International Headache Society criteria for acute migraine were randomized to a single dose of placebo or oral almotriptan 2, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg at the onset of moderate or severe pain. Patients graded pain intensity on a 4-point verbal scale from 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain) and recorded adverse events. The primary efficacy variable was headache response at 2 hours. Data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Results: Nine hundred and three patients were randomized, and 742 were included in the evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability. Headache response at 2 hours was 32.5% with placebo, and 30%, 56.3%, 58.5%, and 66.5% with almotriptan 2, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg doses (p < 0.05 for 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg vs placebo). A dose-dependent decrease in the incidence of migraine-associated symptoms and the need for escape medication was observed. The incidence of adverse events with the almotriptan 2-mg, 6.25-mg, and 12.5-mg groups was comparable to that with the placebo group. Conclusion: Almotriptan 12.5 mg demonstrated the most favorable ratio between efficacy and tolerability, offering equivalent efficacy and better tolerability compared with the 25 mg dose.

Although therapeutic advances in paediatric and adolescent migraine have lagged behind those in adult migraine, the first systematic studies of migraine medications in young patients have brought about progress in the past five years. These studies show that therapeutic approaches suitable for adult patients are not always applicable to paediatric and adolescent patients. Because of the unique characteristics of paediatric and adolescent migraine, it has been difficult to demonstrate in young patients the efficacy of oral sumatriptan and other triptan tablets, which are the medications of choice for adult migraine. With sumatriptan, this finding has proven to be a consequence of the form in which the drug was administered rather than the inherent properties of the drug. The availability of sumatriptan nasal spray allows the benefits of migraine\u2010specific therapy to be extended to children and adolescents. In both well\u2010controlled, single\u2010episode studies and long\u2010term, multiple\u2010episode studies, sumatriptan nasal spray has been effective and well tolerated for the acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents. Except for unpleasant taste, which is not significantly distressing to patients, sumatriptan nasal spray has a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo in young patients.", "outbound_citations": ["11739822", "11678817", "11554957", "11192144", "11061765", "10920150", "10835994", "10595285", "11279931", "11279934", "10499172", "10227648", "9209776", "9229131", "9008503", "8742678", "8810888", "7950559", "1746521", "30751518"], "inbound_citations": ["30038237", "27091010", "21375444"], "label": "0"}

A composite efficacy measure such as the sustained pain-free rate (no pain by 2 hours after dosing, no recurrence, no use of rescue medication from 2 to 24 hours after dosing) may be more appropriate. Clinically relevant differences between almotriptan and other triptans were reviewed in the context of the attributes of acute migraine treatment that patients consider most important. This review was based on published reports of open-label and placebo-controlled clinical trials of almotriptan, results of a survey concerning the attributes patients consider most important in a migraine medication, and a published meta-analysis of 53 placebo-controlled clinical trials of triptans involving >24,000 patients. Almotriptan was effective and well tolerated in the placebo-controlled clinical trials; results of the 6- and 12-month open-label studies supported its good tolerability profile. A respective 87% and 86% of respondents to the patient survey indicated that they considered complete freedom from pain and no recurrence among the most important attributes of migraine treatment, both of which are included in the sustained pain-free rate. In the meta-analysis, almotriptan had a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile compared with other triptans, particularly with respect to sustained pain-free rate, which was significantly higher with almotriptan 12.5 mg compared with sumatriptan 100 mg (25.9% vs 20.0%, respectively; P < 0.05). In addition, the placebo-subtracted rate of adverse events was significantly lower with almotriptan compared with sumatriptan (1.8% vs 4.4%, respectively; P < 0.05). Results of a head-to-head placebo-controlled trial of almotriptan 12.5 mg and sumatriptan 100 mg supported the balance of efficacy and tolerability observed for almotriptan in the meta-analysis. Data from clinical trials suggest that almotriptan is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acute migraine pain.

While a typology of headaches has been recognized for some time, and a number of therapies have been introduced for reduction of headache pain and duration, the causes of migraine remain a subject of debate. Those prone to attacks continue to endure them and suffer the related symptoms such as nausea and disorientation. Frovatriptan, like all the triptans, acts by inducing vasoconstriction of the meningeal arteries. It has been shown in pharmacological tests to act selectively as a potent agonist of serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptors. Frovatriptan has been well tolerated in humans and efficacious in reducing headache pain and duration in clinical trials, which have also indicated that dose adjustments for age or gender are not necessary for the drug. Patients have found the use of frovatriptan acceptable over the long-term, and overall a low-incidence of adverse effects has been reported.

The authors report a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial of a dual-release formulation of oral ketoprofen in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. Methods The authors compared the efficacy of two doses of ketoprofen (75 or 150 mg) with that of placebo (primary analysis) and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg (secondary analysis) on one to four consecutive attacks in 235 intent-to-treat patients (out of 257 randomized patients) with migraine with or without aura. The principal efficacy outcome was headache relief (reduction in headache severity from severe or moderate to mild or absent at 2 hours). Results Results are based on 838 attacks with a severe or moderate headache that were evaluable at 2 hours. Relief was reported for 62.6% of headaches treated with ketoprofen 75 mg, 61.6% with ketoprofen 150 mg, and 66.8% with zolmitriptan. The difference between the three active treatments and placebo (27.8% relief) was highly significant, both tests of ketoprofen vs placebo being globally controlled at a 5% level for the type I error (primary analysis). Headaches at 2 hours disappeared more frequently for the active treatments than for placebo. The authors also demonstrated efficacy on most other secondary outcomes. The tolerance of ketoprofen was good (similar to that of placebo).

In 1960, Simpson first proposed that MG was an autoimmune disease and hypothesized that it resulted from an antibody-dependent block in neuromuscular transmission. Investigations in the 1970s demonstrated the deficiency of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction in MG, the production of animal models by immunization with acetylcholine receptors, the passive transfer of the disease between species with immunoglobulin G, and the presence of antibodies to acetylcholine receptors in most patients with MG.3 Subsequently, the immunopathogenic and electrophysiologic mechanisms involved in the disease were elucidated.\n\nCoincident with these discoveries, effective treatments were developed, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the 1950s, and by 1970, prednisone and other immunosuppressive medications were available. In the 1970s, thymectomy\u2014first described as a treatment modality in 1936\u2014became an increasingly accepted form of therapy.

Earlier clinical trials demonstrated that rizatriptan 5 or 10mg is more effective than placebo at providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated symptoms of migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient quality of life, and showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recently, rizatriptan 10mg was shown to be more effective than zolmitriptan 2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at producing a pain-free state 2 hours postdose. Furthermore, compared with naratriptan, significantly more patients who received rizatriptan were pain free or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. The number of patients with normal functional ability at 2 hours was significantly higher after rizatriptan than after naratriptan or zolmitriptan. Rizatriptan was also generally more effective than zolmitriptan or naratriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms. Rizatriptan is generally well tolerated, and adverse events are usually mild and transient. The most common adverse events associated with rizatriptan in recent randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. There was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan compared with zolmitriptan (31.2 vs 38.8%). However, rizatriptan was associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan (39 vs 29%). The incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of rizatriptan, zolmitriptan or naratriptan (2-4%). In conclusion, rizatriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. Oral rizatriptan 5 and 10mg have shown greater efficacy than placebo in providing pain relief, an absence of pain, relief from associated symptoms, normal functional ability and an improvement in patient quality of life. Earlier results showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recent studies have shown that rizatriptan 10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage of patients with an absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than naratriptan 2.5mg or zolmitriptan 2.5mg. The efficacy of rizatriptan is retained when used in the long term, and the drug is generally well tolerated. Although well designed studies comparing rizatriptan with almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan would further define the position of rizatriptan, current data suggest that rizatriptan should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management of migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["11680669", "11728541", "11673575", "11576198", "11487512", "11453892", "11549974", "11264686", "11061582", "10908770", "11037741", "10709161", "10631625", "11089513", "10611145", "10529545", "10551439", "10417495", "10233200", "11563413", "11284462", "11284463", "9748025", "9595867", "9350384", "9203569", "9225275", "9056052", "10403069"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

In the current placebo-controlled study, we report constancy of safety and efficacy of rizatriptan for patients treating four discrete migraine attacks. Methods: Patients with moderate or severe migraine (n = 473) were randomized to one of five sequence groups, in which each patient was to treat four migraine attacks. Patients in four groups received rizatriptan 10 mg for three of four attacks and placebo for the remaining attack. Patients in the fifth group received rizatriptan 10 mg for four attacks. Headache severity, functional disability, and migraine symptoms were measured immediately before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 hours postdose. Results: After the first attack, response rates were 77% for rizatriptan and 37% for placebo (p < 0.001). Similar efficacy of rizatriptan, ranging from a 75 to 80% response, was observed in each of the subsequent attacks with no evidence of tolerance to therapeutic effects. Most patients(93%) responded to rizatriptan 10 mg during the first or second attack. Adverse experiences were generally mild and transient, the most common being dizziness and somnolence. Incidence of adverse experiences per attack decreased after the first attack. Conclusions: Rizatriptan 10 mg PO is efficacious and generally well tolerated in acute migraine. Its efficacy is maintained throughout the treatment of multiple, discrete migraine attacks.", "outbound_citations": ["9218878", "7635718", "7635717", "8008222", "8299310", "8395342", "1525797", "1525798", "1393842", "1313746", "1727198", "1646776", "1653137", "1653138", "2475821", "12722735", "3719047", "3719049"], "inbound_citations": ["36211148", "32660268", "31389059", "30806518", "27521843"], "label": "1"}

The mode of action of this drug in migraine and cluster headache is discussed. On the basis of a detailed review of all published trials and available data from post-marketing studies, the efficacy, safety, tolerability and the place of oral and subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of both conditions are assessed. A number of double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated that sumatriptan 100 mg administered orally is clearly superior to placebo in the acute treatment of migraine headache and achieves significantly greater response rates than ergotamine or aspirin. In other studies, 70 to 80% of patients receiving sumatriptan 6 mg sc experienced relief of migraine headaches by 1 or 2 h after administration, and patients consistently required less rescue medication for unresolved symptoms. Sumatriptan was also effective in relieving associated migraine symptoms like nausea and vomiting. Sumatriptan was equally effective regardless of migraine type or duration of migraine symptoms. Overall, approximately 40% of patients who initially responded to oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan experienced recurrence of their headache usually within 24 h, effectively treated by a further dose of this drug. In 75% of patients with cluster headache treated with sumatriptan 6 mg sc, relief was achieved within 15 min. Based on pooled study data, sumatriptan is generally well tolerated and most adverse events are transient. Adverse events following oral administration include nausea, vomiting, malaise, fatigue and dizziness. With the subcutaneous injection, injection site reactions occur in approximately 30%. Chest symptoms are reported in 3 to 5% but have been associated with myocardial ischaemia only in rare isolated cases. The recommended dosage of sumatriptan at the onset of migraine symptoms is 100 mg orally or 6 mg subcutaneously. The recommended dosage for cluster headache is 6 mg sumatriptan sc. Sumatriptan must not be given together with vascoconstrictive substances, e.g. ergotamines, or with migraine prophylactics with similar properties, e.g. methysergide. Sumatriptan should not be given during the migraine aura.

A total of 296 patients fulfilling the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine were enrolled. In total, one or two migraine attacks were treated in 268 and 235 patients, respectively. The primary endpoint for the first treated attack was headache relief, with intensity decreasing from moderate or severe to mild or absent 2 h after drug intake. Usual secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed. A superiority of CM over EC was observed for both treated attacks for the main endpoint: success in 54 versus 36%, p = 0.003 for the first attack and 60 versus 44%, p = 0.02 for the second attack. CM was also significantly superior to EC during the first attack for complete headache relief (20 vs. 8%, p = 0.006), nausea (42 vs. 63%, p = 0.007) and willingness to take the drug again (90 vs. 80%, p = 0.043). The global efficacy evaluation, rated by the investigators, was significantly more favorable to CM for both attacks (p = 0.001 for the first attack and p = 0.02 for the second). The patients\u2019 evaluation was significant for the first attack (p = 0.002). The global incidence of adverse events was 45% higher with EC, though not significant (32 vs. 22%, p = 0.075). They were most often unspecific and mild to moderate in intensity. Gastrointestinal side effects were significantly less frequent with CM than EC (7 vs. 21%, p = 0.001).

She develops blurred vision, goose bumps on her arms, slight nausea, clear nasal drainage, and a \u201ctight\u201d feeling in the right superior trapezius area, followed the next day by severe, incapacitating, right-sided headache with associated nausea and light sensitivity, lasting 3 days. These episodes have been occurring once monthly for the last 4 years, at varying points throughout her menstrual cycle. She is not aware of any triggers. She does not have neck pain at other times. Acute treatment with ibuprofen, acetaminophen, Excedrin, or Midrin has not helped. Neurologic examination is normal. Questions.\u2014 How common is migrainous prodrome, and what clinical features may be present? What is the pathophysiology of prodrome? Would triptan therapy during the prodrome be likely to be beneficial? EXPERT COMMENTARY This patient suffers from migraine without aura. The International Headache Society uses the term premonitory to describe symptoms that may precede headache by up to 48 hours, but some authors prefer the term prodrome. Prodrome should be distinguished from migraine aura, with the latter involving focal neurologic symptoms which typically develop gradually over 5 to 20 minutes, last less than 60 minutes, and are followed by headache within an hour. 1", "outbound_citations": ["10805332", "10961768", "9305317", "8792035", "3048700", "4084978", "6375874", "6343298", "6337976", "7437756"], "inbound_citations": ["23210467"], "label": "0"}

The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration curve (AUC) appeared linear over all dose ranges, with an apparent terminal half-life of 4 to 5 hours. Clearance and volume of distribution remained constant with dose. The time to first occurrence of Cmax (tmax) for oral eletriptan was approximately 1 hour and was unaffected by dose. Comparison of AUC values suggested an absolute bioavailability of approximately 50%. A linear PK/PD model, fitted to the data, predicted small, transient elevations in diastolic blood pressure following eletriptan doses > or = 60 mg. These effects were considered unlikely to be clinically significant. Eletriptan was well tolerated, and treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate and transient. These PK properties should result in eletriptan having a rapid onset and sustained duration of action in terms of migraine efficacy.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["30588869", "29497279", "28361200", "27582896"], "label": "1"}

Chest pain is considered to be a relatively common adverse reaction to sumatriptan.\n\n\nDESIGN\nPostmarketing study.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe study was a part of a national cohort study on adverse reactions to sumatriptan, which was performed with the assistance of drug-dispensing general practitioners in the Netherlands. After data were collected on observed adverse reactions, the patients received a second questionnaire, with specific questions regarding the adverse event, and questions regarding medical history, other health complaints, and smoking habits. Furthermore, they had a physical examination and a blood cholesterol measurement.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 137 patients with chest pain associated with intake of sumatriptan were identified and compared with 229 consumers of sumatriptan without this adverse reaction. After multivariate analysis, young age, hypertension, general complaints of abdominal pain, and a family history of myocardial infarction were associated with an increased risk of chest pain attributed to sumatriptan. Hypertension in particular was a risk factor for sumatriptan-induced chest pain in men (relative risk, 8.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-40) compared with hypertension as a risk factor in women (relative risk, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-3.1).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nYoung age, hypertension, general complaints of abdominal pain, and a family history of myocardial infarction are associated with an increased risk of chest pain attributed to sumatriptan. Sex is an effective modifier of risk factors of sumatriptan-induced chest pain. In particular, hypertension is a strong risk factor in men.", "outbound_citations": ["8904614", "8682677", "8848207", "7564725", "7648652", "7783891", "7752771", "7775177", "7788702", "7832891", "7934431", "7914265", "7516861", "8251846", "8349804", "8328499", "8096980", "8096983", "8096565", "8381056", "8419028", "1360559", "1337261", "1516154", "1327369", "1320974", "1379152", "1647495", "1985444", "1653142", "2242457", "2355955", "13974778"], "inbound_citations": ["20977405"], "label": "1"}

The published literature, periodic safety update reports, the randomised controlled trials of antiplatelet agents in stroke prevention and those including dipyridamole in cardiovascular indications, have been reviewed and analysed.

In the American Migraine Study II, involving a survey of 29 258 persons living in the United States, researchers found that 1 in 4 households contained at least 1 migraine sufferer and that over the past 10 years, the proportion of patients whose migraine had been diagnosed medically increased from 39% to 48%. 2 Despite this increase in the proportion of those medically diagnosed, the number of patients treated with prescription drugs for migraine increased only 4% (from 37% to 41%) between 1989 and 1999. One concern of patients with migraine is that their headaches will recur despite treatment. Is recurrence an accurate measure of a migraine drug\u2019s efficacy? Given currently available data, it might not be so. Although headache recurrence rates are an oftenquoted statistic from clinical trials of drugs for migraine, recurrence may be of less importance than are other clinical end points such as pain relief and relief of associated symptoms. In addition, accurately measuring recurrence rates is difficult even in a controlled clinical trial setting. ESTABLISHING CLINICAL END POINTS Clinical trial end points for migraine drugs ideally should reflect patients\u2019 desires, and rapid and complete relief of pain and associated symptoms are chief amongst those desires. End points common to migraine drug trials have included pain relief, pain resolution, time to pain relief, relief of functional impairment, and time to failure (determined by the need for rescue medication). 3 Although usually recorded/reported, headache recurrence typically has not been a primary end point. The most often used primary end point in migraine clinical trials has been pain relief, with patients considered treatment responders if their moderateto-severe head pain reduced to mild or no pain within 2 hours of drug administration. A more delayed headache response generally is considered unacceptable for migraine-specific acute therapies. 3 An even more stringent criterion for assessing the efficacy of a migraine drug has been proposed by the International Headache Society (IHS) Clinical Trials Committee: pain-free status at 2 hours. 3", "outbound_citations": ["11135021", "11037741", "10920403", "10759909", "10529545", "10563229", "10362912", "10376171", "10234467", "10099848", "10210888", "11284462", "11284463", "9595867", "9563208", "9409334", "9371896", "9439085", "9218881", "9153607", "8873693", "8935482", "8792039", "8614525", "7644049", "7601299", "8502385", "191380"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

There was no significant change of R2 threshold, latency or area in CH patients. After paired supraorbital stimuli, R2 recovered more rapidly in patients on the symptomatic side. After index stimulations, R2 recovery was more rapid on both symptomatic and non-symptomatic sides in patients compared to controls. Naloxone (0.4 mg) i.v. in two subjects partially reversed the R2 suppression induced by index finger stimuli. The unilateral decrease of R2 inhibition after a segmental supraorbital stimulus most likely reflects sensitisation in the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Whether the latter is due to irritation of the ophthalmic nerve within the cavernous sinus region, which is thought to be pivotal in CH pathogenesis, remains to be proven.

The naratriptan to placebo ratio was 95% (95% CI: 87\u2013104%; p = 0.263) for 1 mg; 94% (95% CI: 86\u2013102%; p=0.142) for 5 mg; and 94% (95% CI: 86\u2013103%; p = 0.157) for 10 mg. The percentage of patients reporting adverse events was 53% with placebo, 53% with sc naratriptan 1 mg, 89% with 5 mg and 89% with 10 mg. In conclusion, these results suggest that sc naratriptan doses similar to and above the oral therapeutic dose equivalent (single oral dose 2.5 mg) have no significant effect on peripheral blood flow as measured by FBF. Sc naratriptan doses 1 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg were well tolerated.", "outbound_citations": ["10214771", "9439085", "9170336", "9009470", "9046718", "8371215", "1359209", "1910019", "3410065", "3048700", "3899452", "13085295"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

A wide variety of agents are available for the symptomatic treatment of migraine headache, including over-the-counter analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), combination products, opiates, ergot alkaloids, corticosteroids, dopamine antagonists, and triptans. In the stepped-care approach, simple analgesics and NSAIDs are the recommended first step for the treatment of mild-to-moderate migraine headaches. Patients who do not respond to first-step treatments may be given ergots, combination products, dopamine antagonists, or triptans as the second step. Corticosteroids or opiates may be used as rescue treatment in patients who do not respond to second-step treatment. A stratified approach to care individualizes treatment based on the severity of the headache and other patient-specific factors. In a stratified approach, dihydroergotamine or triptans may be the first-step treatment for patients who present with a history of severe migraines that have responded poorly to previous treatments. Sumatriptan was the first triptan approved for the symptomatic treatment of migraine headache; newer triptans include zolmitriptan, naratriptan, and rizatriptan. Since sumatriptan is rapidly absorbed by the subcutaneous route, its time to onset of effect is shortest. Among triptan drugs that are administered orally, the relative time to onset may be shorter with rizatriptan than sumatriptan.

Diclofenac-potassium was developed as an immediate-release tablet with the aim of providing rapid onset of action after oral administration. This formulation has been investigated in the acute treatment of migraine. Data from available placebo-controlled clinical trials indicate that diclofenac-potassium 50 or 100mg as an immediate-release tablet is more effective than placebo and as effective as oral sumatriptan 100mg and ergotamine plus caffeine at reducing pain intensity in patients with migraine 2 hours after initial administration. Duration of pain relief is similar for the 3 drugs but onset appears to be faster with diclofenac-potassium than with oral sumatriptan or ergotamine plus caffeine. Diclofenac-potassium appears to have favourable effects on some accompanying symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. The frequency of these symptoms was significantly lower with diclofenac-potassium than with sumatriptan in 1 study, although only a few patients had vomiting at baseline. Effects on phonophobia or photophobia did not differ between diclofenac-potassium, sumatriptan and ergotamine plus caffeine. The need for rescue medication is consistently less with diclofenac-potassium than with placebo. Data are inconsistent or scarce regarding the effects of diclofenac-potassium versus placebo on other measures such as headache recurrence and working ability. Diclofenac-potassium was generally well tolerated in clinical trials in patients with migraine. Adverse events reported most frequently (abdominal pain, tiredness and fatigue and nausea) were typically mild to moderate.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDiclofenac-potassium provides rapid pain relief (within 60 to 90 minutes), is well tolerated and reduces the frequency of some of the accompanying symptoms in patients with migraine. Available trials indicate that diclofenac-potassium provides similar pain relief to sumatriptan and is at least as effective as ergotamine plus caffeine, but appears to have a greater effect on nausea and vomiting than sumatriptan and a faster onset of action than both drugs. Comparisons with other NSAIDs are lacking. Diclofenac-potassium is likely to find a role as a useful first-line option in the acute treatment of migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["10168038", "10166407", "1864448", "1872757", "10376168", "8917290", "8385160", "7835380", "2127562", "2111251", "8495453", "10423616", "1551795", "7911231", "8634619", "9145054", "2036663", "8902258", "1349944", "3286213", "10155264", "10179702", "9009469", "8824005", "3048700", "9071263"], "inbound_citations": ["35469478", "27731828"], "label": "0"}

It has recently been suggested that a release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from peripheral terminals of trigeminal nociceptive neurons, which supply cephalic blood vessels, underlies symptoms of cluster headache. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the provocative action of nitroglycerine in cluster headache is due, at least in part, to activation of the trigeminovascular system. Nineteen subjects suffering from episodic cluster headache participated in the study. Eleven of them were in an active period, whilst the others were in remission at the time of the study. CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) was measured in blood samples from the extracerebral circulation before and after the sublingual administration of nitroglycerine. Baseline CGRP-LI plasma levels were higher (P < 0.05) in the patients who were in an active period. Only in these patients did nitroglycerine induce an attack, which was preceded by a latent period with a mean duration of 27 +/- 3 min. When compared with the baseline, a significant (P < 0.01) increase in plasma CGRP-LI was detected at the peak of the provoked attack; no such increase was detected during the latent period, or at the onset of the attack. The results of this study suggests that the provocative action of nitroglycerine in cluster headache is due, at least in part, to activation of the trigeminovascular system. This mechanism seems to be slow and unrelated to the well-known rapidly occurring vasodilator effects of the drug. Finally, activation of the trigeminovascular system only occurs in those patients already in an active cluster headache period who also have high basal CGRP-LI plasma levels. This suggests that a hyperactivity of trigeminal nociceptive fibres could make the trigeminovascular system of these patients sensitive to the triggering action of nitroglycerine.", "outbound_citations": ["7504210", "2113834", "2106796", "4971733"], "inbound_citations": ["36976663", "35674077", "35674078", "34822741", "33782592", "33615843", "34266608", "32990832", "32962406", "32847402", "32806953", "32702245", "32753938", "32548854", "32293721", "31997136", "30771365", "30820761", "30982963", "30854880", "30655693", "29987329", "30242519", "30221765", "29082823", "29082824", "29915913", "29623198", "29516437", "29493566", "27940880", "28856479", "27475101", "26931452"], "label": "0"}

DATA SOURCE: A MEDLINE search was conducted for the period from January 1990 to June 1998. Key words used included naratriptan, triptan, serotonin agonists, migraine, and migraine therapy. In addition, pertinent references cited in articles obtained from MEDLINE and product information for triptans were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All original and review articles and abstracts pertaining to naratriptan were reviewed, as were product information extracts. Clinical trials of naratriptan were critically reviewed and compared with pertinent clinical trials of other oral triptans. DATA SYNTHESIS: The treatment of migraine has been dramatically improved with the use of sumatriptan, other triptans, and serotonin-receptor subtype 1B and 1D agonists. Drawbacks to these medications, however, have included poorly tolerated adverse effects and the recurrence of the migraine. Naratriptan has been recently approved for acute oral migraine therapy. In two Phase III trials of naratriptan compared with placebo, relief at four hours was obtained in 60% and 68% of patients using the 2.5-mg dose, with recurrence of headache in 24 hours in 27% and 28% of patients. The data on migraine recurrence were similar to those of other oral triptans; the efficacy of naratriptan at two hours was not specifically analyzed. Adverse effects of naratriptan were similar to placebo, and its tolerability seemed superior compared with studies of other oral triptans.

Migraine Headache Patients with migraine headaches often have difficulty explaining their suffering. In the physician's office, the typical patient places the heel of the hand in one orbit and the fingers up over the forehead, all in the first division of the fifth cranial nerve. Migraine pain is actually pain that is referred into the first division of the trigeminal nerve, and it is probably due to an abnormality in the way in which the central nervous system processes nociceptive information. Promotility Agent Was Effective in Treatment Tfelt-Hansen P, Henry P, Mulder LJ, et al. The effectiveness of combined oral lysine acetylsalicylate and metoclopramide compared with oral sumatriptan for migraine. Lancet. 1995; 346:923-6. Sumatriptan has become a commonly used agent for migraine headaches. It is expensive, however, and patients often delay taking a drug that costs as much as $35 a dose. The injectable form is difficult for some patients to take, and the nasal form is poorly absorbed and leaves a bitter aftertaste. The oral drug is poorly absorbed because migraine attacks also cause gastric stasis and therefore decrease absorption of all oral drugs. In this clinical trial, Tfelt-Hansen and colleagues assessed the effectiveness of salicylates (the class of drug most commonly used for migraine) plus a promotility agent. They randomly assigned 421 patients with migraine to receive metoclopramide, 10 mg, followed by lysine acetylsalicylate (equivalent to 900 mg of aspirin); oral sumatriptan (100 mg); or placebo. In 57% of patients receiving the combined regimen, 53% of those receiving sumatriptan, and 24% of those receiving placebo, the intensity of headache decreased from severe to mild or absent. This study makes a critical point about the treatment of migraine: Simple oral medication alone is relatively ineffective. A promotility agent plus aspirin performed at least as well as the most expensive drug available. Another effective drug is indomethacin, which is given by suppository and crosses the blood-brain barrier. This is an effective and commonly used agent in Europe but has not become popular in the United States [1]. Indomethacin suppositories contain 50 mg of the drug. Because many headaches recur, I instruct patients to cut a 50-mg indomethacin suppository into thirds and insert them every 10 to 15 minutes as necessary. For patients who decline to use suppositories, a basic oral analgesic following a dose of metoclopramide is a reasonable second choice that is much less expensive than most alternatives. Two new drugs, zolmitriptan and naratriptan, are now available, but they offer little advantage over previously available medications because they are available only in oral preparations. Divalproex Sodium Seemed To Be Effective Prophylaxis Silberstein SD. Divalproex sodium in headache: literature review and clinical guidelines. Headache. 1996; 36:547-55. For patients with severe or frequent migraine attacks, propranolol and amitriptyline are frequently used as prophylaxis. Many other agents have been shown to decrease the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks (Table 1). Table 1. Drugs Used for Migraine Prophylaxis In this nonsystematic review, Silberstein cited all clinical studies of divalproex sodium (sodium valproate plus valproic acid) used as prophylaxis against migraine. Valproic acid, a standard antiseizure medication, is presumed to exert its effects by facilitating the action of the neurotransmitter -aminobutyric acid (GABA). In reviewing four small, randomized clinical trials, Silberstein found that divalproex sodium greatly improved the headache indices in 75% to 87% of patients. In general, headache frequency decreased by about 50% in patients receiving divalproex sodium and by about 10% to 15% in patients receiving placebo. Divalproex sodium seemed to be slightly more effective than propranolol. Although the studies were small and larger ones are needed, valproic acid, generally prescribed as divalproex sodium, seems to be a good choice for migraine prophylaxis. It appears to be at least as effective as and better tolerated than -blockers or tricyclic antidepressants. However, valproic acid may cause weight gain and hair loss and should not be used by women who may become pregnant. This contraindication could be a serious clinical problem because many patients with migraine are young women. Stroke Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Recent advances in treatment include thrombolytic therapy given within 3 hours after onset of ischemic stroke. Early studies also indicate that blockage of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, reduces the sensitivity of central neurons to ischemia; however, no glutamate-blocking drugs are clinically available. These therapeutic advances have reinvigorated clinical investigation of stroke. Transesophageal Echocardiography Outperformed Transthoracic Echocardiography Rauh R, Fischereder M, Spengel FA. Transesophageal echocardiography in patients with focal cerebral ischemia of unknown cause. Stroke. 1996; 27:691-4. The onset of stroke due to occlusive vascular disease, or thrombosis, is stepwise or progressive (stuttering onset). This type of stroke often occurs while the patient is sleeping. Embolic strokes usually are sudden in onset and produce maximum neurologic deficits at the outset. A patient presenting with stroke usually undergoes computed tomography to rule out bleeding and undergoes carotid Doppler studies to detect severe stenoses, which can be repaired surgically. However, when patients have neither a hemorrhagic stroke nor evidence of carotid stenosis, the rest of the diagnostic evaluation is controversial. Rauh and colleagues assessed the usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography in patients with cerebral ischemia of unknown cause. Thirty consecutive patients who had completed strokes were enrolled. All patients were in sinus rhythm, had no cardiac disease known to be linked to the occurrence of cardiogenic emboli, had minimal carotid artery stenosis, and were evaluated by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. Transthoracic echocardiography yielded abnormal findings in 16 patients, but no embolic source was found. Transesophageal echocardiography identified thrombus in the left atrial appendage in 3 patients, atrial septal aneurysm in 2, and patent foramen ovale in 7. It also disclosed aortic plaques in 19 patients. The use of transesophageal echocardiography prompted a change of therapy in 3 of the 30 patients. Transesophageal echocardiography is thus the test of choice for evaluating patients suspected of having embolic strokes. Compared with dual-helical computed tomography, an expensive test that is not always available, transesophageal echocardiography has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 82%. Thus, it is 3 to 6 times more accurate than transthoracic echocardiography. It is a safe test; only 1 person died among 10 000 tests, and this patient had undiagnosed esophageal cancer. Because of its ability to detect patent foramen ovale, the technique also precludes the need for venography or other studies to look for deep venous thrombi. Many patients do not require transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography. Patients who will receive anticoagulants (such as those with atrial fibrillation or dilated cardiomyopathy) do not need this study. Similarly, if a decision has been made not to use anticoagulation, no study is necessary. As with all tests, transesophageal echocardiography should be used only in patients whose therapy may be altered as a result of the test. Evidence Linked Alzheimer Disease to Hemorrhagic Stroke Greenberg SM, Briggs ME, Hyman BT, et al. Apolipoprotein E 4 is associated with the presence and earlier onset of hemorrhage in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Stroke. 1996; 27:1333-7. Intracerebral hemorrhage has historically resulted from hypertension. In such strokes, the source of bleeding is small vessels in the putamen and other areas in the deep brain. Despite aggressive treatment of hypertension, however, cerebral hemorrhage has remained nearly as common as in the past. The reason is the increased frequency of cortical hemorrhages. This type of hemorrhage may result from extension of a hypertensive hemorrhage, trauma, hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic infarction, hemorrhage of a tumor, or cerebral vascular malformation. A growing cause of hemorrhage in the cortex or gray or white matter is amyloid angiopathy, which leads to small and sometimes multiple hemorrhages. Risk factors include old age or a personal or family history of Alzheimer disease. Because apolipoprotein E 4 is associated with a family risk for Alzheimer disease, Greenberg and colleagues sought to determine whether this allele is associated with amyloid angiopathy. They identified 27 patients who presented with cerebral lobar hemorrhage and had a high probability of amyloid angiopathy. These patients were compared with 1899 elderly patients from a population-based sample and 18 patients with deep cerebral hemorrhage that was characteristic of a hypertensive mechanism. Patients with multiple lobar hemorrhage had a twofold increase in frequency of the apolipoprotein E 4 allele compared with the general population sample. Patients who carried the 4 allele and sustained lobar hemorrhages were more than 5 years younger than those without the allele who sustained lobar hemorrhages. The clinical message from this study is not completely clear, but the results should cause clinicians to at least consider age and Alzheimer disease as risk factors for adverse effects of warfarin. However, for most patients who are at risk because of thromboembolic disease, includ", "outbound_citations": ["11070098", "9288042", "9176495", "8971313", "8668784", "8531944", "8531961", "7723155", "2230261", "2664509"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

The serotonin (5HT1) receptor agonist sumatriptan has been shown in clinical trials to alleviate headache and associated symptoms in the majority of patients treated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThree hundred forty-four (344) patients with migraine were allowed to treat an unlimited number of migraine attacks for up to 24 months with subcutaneous sumatriptan (6 mg). Open-label oral sumatriptan (100 mg) could be used between 1 hour and 24 hours after the initial injection for treatment of recurrent or persistent headache. On four occasions during the treatment period, patients completed the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Survey, a general health status instrument; the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, a disease-specific instrument; and a series of questions designed to measure the impact of migraine on productivity and disability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTreatment with sumatriptan was associated with significant (P < .05) improvements relative to baseline in three of the Short Form-36 Health Survey quality-of-life dimensions (Bodily Pain, General Health Perceptions, and Social Functioning) and three of the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire dimensions (Role Function-Restrictive, Role Function-Preventive, and Emotional Function). Significant (P < .05) improvements in patient-rated productivity and reductions in patient-rated disability also occurred during the trial.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients using sumatriptan to treat migraines for up to 24 months experienced improvements in disability and productivity as well as in health-related quality of life as measured either by a general health status instrument or a disease-specific instrument.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36106210", "31593810", "30106172"], "label": "1"}

Serum sumatriptan levels were measured by high\u2010performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection in serial samples collected over 8 hours. Physical exam, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram measurements were monitored to assess safety and tolerability. A total of 16 subjects (10 males and 6 females) had pharmacokinetic data that could be analyzed, 2 withdrew from the study 30 and 60 minutes after dosing following the loss of venous access for blood sampling, and a bioanalysis failure resulted in loss of data from 3 subjects. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters (geometric mean and 95% confidence interval) for the remaining 16 subjects were as follows: Cmax was 13.9 (11.0, 17.6) ng/mL, AUC\u221e was 57.3 (47.6, 69.0) ng/mL\u2022, and t1/2 was 2.0 (1.8, 2.3) hours. Population pharmacokinetic analysis for all subjects (n = 21) showed that clearance and volume of distribution increase slightly with age and body size, but the changes were minimal and would not warrant dose adjustment: CL/F was 316 L (coefficient of variance [CV] = 25%) and Vd/F was 1070 L (CV = 46%).

Methods: Post hoc analysis was performed on data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Four hundred seventy-three patients with migraine diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Headache Society were randomly assigned to one of five sequence groups in which each patient was scheduled to treat four separate moderate or severe migraine attacks. Patients in four groups received 10 mg of rizatriptan for three of four attacks and placebo for the remaining attack; patients in the fifth group received 10 mg of rizatriptan for all four attacks. Headache severity, functional disability, and associated migraine symptoms were measured immediately before dosing and at regular intervals up to 4 hours after the dose. The analysis was based on efficacy at 2 hours after dosing, the last time point before escape medications were allowed. The percentages of patients who responded in a specified number of attacks after treatment with rizatriptan were calculated. The analysis was descriptive, and no formal statistical testing was performed. Results: Of the evaluable patients who treated three migraine attacks with 10 mg of rizatriptan (with an additional interspersed placebo-treated attack in most patients), 216 of 252 (86%) had pain relief (reduction of pain to mild or none), 122 of 252 (48%) were pain free, 211 of 250 (84%) had no nausea, 163 of 251 (65%) had no photophobia, 182 of 252 (72%) had no phonophobia, 136 of 249 (55%) had no functional disability, and 233 of 252 (92%) had no need for escape medications at 2 hours after dosing in at least two of three attacks. Conclusion: The response to 10 mg of oral rizatriptan within individual patients was consistent over three attacks on a range of measures.\u20131516", "outbound_citations": ["10611145", "15992122", "10640259", "11284462", "11284463", "9748025", "9673807", "9595867", "9563208", "9563207", "9371896", "9399015", "8550361", "7644080", "7885585", "7970003", "8008223", "7909309", "1653135", "1653138"], "inbound_citations": ["36224519", "34667919", "32935848", "32648205", "31062349", "27813032", "26178694", "24912394", "23946318", "20855373", "20878535", "20974601", "20959428", "20170842"], "label": "1"}

Two independent double-blind, randomized clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan suppositories following ascending single dose. (four different dose levels) and multiple doses. In the four-period, crossover, single-dose study, 24 healthy male subjects were randomized to receive a suppository containing 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 mg on separate occasions 3\u201314 days apart. The suppositories were generally well tolerated; transient asthenia, drowsiness, and headache were the most frequently reported adverse events, and these were not close-related. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of sumatriptan were proportional to close from 25 to 100 mg; area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCx) values were proportional to dose except at the highest doses, when they were greater than those predicted from lower doses. For all doses, the tmax of sumatriptan occurred within 2.5h, and the t1/2 was approximately 2h. In the two-period, placebo-controlled, crossover, repeat-dose study, 12 healthy adult male subjects were randomized to receive either a 50-mg sumatriptan suppository or placebo suppository, administered rectally twice a day, for 11 doses (5 1/2 days). Adverse events were no more frequent with sumatriptan than with placebo, and stool guaiac, rectal examinations, and physical examinations remained normal. No significant differences were noted between Day 1 and Day 6 values in the AUC, Cmax, time of peak serum concentration (tmax), elimination half-life (t1/2), fraction of the dose excreted in the urine (fe), or renal clearance (Clr) of sumatriptan or its pharmacologically inactive indole acetic acid metabolite. Serum metabolite concentrations were two to threefold higher than corresponding sumatriptan concentrations. No clinically significant accumulation of sumatriptan or its metabolite occurred. Overall, these studies show that sumatriptan administration via a suppository formulation is well tolerated, allows rapid absorption of sumatriptan, results in sumatriptan Cmax values that are proportion I to dose from 25 to 100 mg, and is not associated with accumulation of sumatriptan or its nnetabolite.", "outbound_citations": ["8161354", "8381488", "1647495", "1681162", "1851894", "1653135", "1665260", "1653140", "1653138", "2544285", "6126289"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

This double-blind crossover placebo-controlled trial investigated changes in BFV in extra- and intracranial arteries in 132 migraine attacks (66 patients) before and after treatment with either 6 mg sumatriptan s.c. or placebo.

Efficacy data were used to determine the number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve pain-free status in 1 patient within 2 hours postdose and then applied the per-dose costs for each triptan to the NNT values.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRizatriptan 10 mg and almotriptan 12.5 mg were the most cost-effective of the triptans, costing $48.34 and $48.57 US dollars, respectively, to achieve pain-free status in 1 patient within 2 hours postdose. Frovatriptan 2.5 mg was the most costly, with a cost-effective ratio of $162.49 US dollars. All other triptans fell between these extremes: zolmitriptan 5 mg ($65.18 US dollars), sumatriptan 100 mg ($70.83 US dollars), sumatriptan 50 mg ($75.67 US dollars), zolmitriptan 2.5 mg ($78.74 US dollars), and naratriptan 2.5 mg ($141.43 US dollars), in decreasing order of cost-effectiveness.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nUsing an NNT analysis, the least-costly drugs to achieve migraine cure within 2 hours are rizatriptan 10 mg and almotriptan 12.5 mg. From a population health perspective, the lower acquisition cost of almotriptan 12.5 mg allows for effective treatment of more patients than rizatriptan 10 mg for no additional medication cost.", "outbound_citations": ["8164015", "12167138", "12028324", "12028323", "11914403", "12005271", "11723269", "11728541", "11445657", "11094108", "11061765", "11048903", "11075844", "11037741", "10817444", "10636142", "11041768", "10565699", "10529545", "10692717", "10563229", "10430113", "10219926", "10193663", "10403069", "9886479", "10537960", "10210888", "11284463", "9748025", "9700983", "10179912", "9595867", "9563208", "9563211", "9371896", "9350384", "9009469", "9371897", "9046715", "8912486", "7564725", "7644082", "7672955", "7873954", "8381852", "8436495"], "inbound_citations": ["36327391", "34935103", "29201122", "26315122", "25185875", "26178290", "26031979", "25294555", "25056381", "23839914", "23773016", "23463742", "22644173", "21490308", "21533722", "21437714", "20686810", "20464583", "20511208"], "label": "0"}

The aim of the present work was to assess a satiety drinking test in the evaluation of accommodation in health and dyspepsia. Methods: Twenty five controls and 37 severely dyspeptic patients seen at a tertiary care centre completed a dyspepsia questionnaire, and gastric emptying and gastric barostat studies. The amount of liquid meal ingested at maximum satiety during a slow satiety drinking test was determined. In controls, we studied the influence of caloric density and of pharmacological agents that influence accommodation. Results: In patients, satiety scores were higher and maximum satiety occurred at lower calories (542 (50) v 1508 (53) kcal; p<0.0001). Six patients had required nutritional support, but excluding these did not alter the correlations. With increasing severity of early satiety, less calories were ingested at maximum satiety. In multivariate analysis, the amount of calories was significantly correlated to accommodation but not to gastric emptying or sensitivity. Sensitivity and specificity of the satiety test in predicting impaired accommodation reached 92% and 86%, respectively. At different caloric densities, ingested volume rather than caloric load determined maximum satiety. Pharmacological agents (sumatriptan, cisapride, erythromycin) affected the satiety test according to their effect on accommodation. Conclusion: A slow caloric drinking test can be used to evaluate accommodation and early satiety. It provides a non-invasive method of predicting impaired accommodation and quantifying pharmacological influences on accommodation.", "outbound_citations": ["8674389", "9052500", "12738456", "12055618", "11677196", "11589374", "11522735", "10993427", "10789614", "10600819", "29598741", "10457043", "10419914", "9834261", "9726390", "9691921", "9536949", "9505883", "9142924", "8770012", "8612991", "7797033", "8527013", "7605850", "7835573", "8139794", "8150341", "8500721", "1529280", "1889724", "1896825", "2320062", "3364568", "PMC1766695", "PMC1727007", "PMC1374584", "PMC1727131", "10600919"], "inbound_citations": ["36859629", "36832289", "36606437", "36436612", "36229642", "36226998", "35799230", "35799236", "35798375", "35503488", "35411675", "34710865", "34586707", "34431184", "34504426", "34337824", "34183577", "34153172", "34148244", "33941747", "33939891", "33915747", "33743867", "33528850", "33183504", "33049222", "32710649", "32612016", "32476804", "32426361", "32294551", "32269066", "32089623", "31899982", "31608532", "31859433", "31391920", "30702487", "30809083", "30675023", "30791841", "30298964", "30396527", "30245474", "30385743", "30397412", "29652893", "29635488", "30023062", "28899670", "30385748", "28895582", "28887755", "29071541", "28529164", "28695632", "27557427", "27418395", "28217377", "27539628", "28116817", "27639359", "27867690", "27535977", "27251213", "27357933", "27332558", "27648466", "27195249", "26503455", "26538208", "26655943", "26399958", "26661735", "26541810", "26064155", "25557693", "24901089", "24273197", "24842276", "24840374", "24063547", "23702005", "23587435", "24917984", "22846777", "23567355", "23938047", "23247728", "23112550", "22837882", "22837871", "22606278", "22188490", "22103293", "22420866", "22160229", "22100113", "21952611", "21767283", "21769117", "21255195", "21199175", "21624107", "21342212", "21417958", "20979591", "20884888", "20868426", "21369497", "21118281", "20087194", "20680166", "20146701", "20093561", "21180597", "19814775"], "label": "0"}

Migraine-related resource use data were obtained from the managed care organization's medical and pharmacy claims databases. The primary outcome measure for this economic analysis was the total disability time that patients experienced because of migraine. Patients reported time missed from work and usual nonwork activities because of migraine on self-administered questionnaires at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after initiation of sumatriptan.\n\n\nRESULTS\nInitiation of sumatriptan resulted in a decrease of 662 migraine-disability-days for work and 1236 migraine-disability-days for nonwork activities during the 6 months of the study (decrease from 27.8 to 17.2 days per person), totaling 1898 migraine-disability-days averted with sumatriptan therapy. Migraine-related medical costs were lower after sumatriptan was initiated ($18,351 vs $26,192), whereas migraine-related pharmacy costs were lower with prior nontriptan drug therapy ($22,209 vs $74,861). The overall net cost savings after sumatriptan was initiated in these patients was $222,332 ($1249 per patient) with a benefit-to-cost ratio of $5.67 gained for each health care dollar spent from a societal perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $25 for each additional migraine-disability-day averted by using sumatriptan vs nontriptan drug therapy. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes in medical costs had little effect on the ratios and that sumatriptan remained cost-beneficial across a wide range of patient wages.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study showed that initiation of sumatriptan in patients previously receiving nontriptan therapy was cost-effective and had an economic benefit for patients, employers, and society. Sumatriptan also helped patients and physicians achieve goals recommended by the US Headache Consortium by reducing patients' disability and thus improving their ability to function at work and nonwork activities.", "outbound_citations": ["11079284", "10943230", "10219932", "10219926", "10090435", "9588435", "9253726", "10169243", "8916561", "8800968", "8900548", "8984084", "8537803", "7591736", "8303497", "1727198", "10311399", "7383070"], "inbound_citations": ["36327391", "35311748", "32169031", "24875925", "23094760", "23330402", "23001069", "22183497", "14871164", "11700778", "20668923", "20473477", "20385889", "20352584"], "label": "1"}

The results of the study by Winner et al confirm the clinical impression that subcutaneous sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine are equally effective in aborting migraine attacks, although sumatriptan showed a speedier effect than dihydroergotamine, which in turn got a longer-lasting effect (probably because of its longer half-life).

Significant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events are rare but have been observed.

Antacids are no more effective than placebo in treating nonulcer dyspepsia. H2-receptor antagonists appear to be superior to placebo in efficacy, but many of the studies suggesting this finding have had a suboptimal study design. Proton pump inhibitors have been shown to be superior to placebo, although questions remain as to whether the only subgroup that responds is comprised of patients with unrecognized gastroesophageal reflux disease. Studies have found that prokinetic agents are superior to placebo, but currently only a very limited number of agents within this class can be prescribed in the United States. Sparse data support the role of metoclopramide and its side effects limit its use even further. The eradication of Helicobacter pylori has a small but positive therapeutic benefit in non-ulcer dyspepsia, and can be considered in those confirmed to be infected. Sucralfate is unlikely to be effective, and misoprostol is ineffective. Bismuth alone is probably not efficacious. Tricyclic antidepressants may have a therapeutic role, but this is not firmly established and this class of medication should be reserved for resistant cases. Emerging therapies include drugs that relax the gastric fundus, such as buspirone or sumatriptan, and the new prokinetic tegaserod.
