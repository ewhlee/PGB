The analgesic effects extended over 48 hours, as shown by statistically significant (P=0.013\u20130.020) improvements in all three outcomes on the rest days instituted between each daily dose. Analgesic effects (lowered maximum pain intensity and increased pain relief, on the day of dosing only) were also seen when the lower daily dose of 10 mg methadone (given as 5 mg bd) was used, but these failed to reach statistical significance (P=0.064 and 0.065, respectively). Interpatient analysis showed that the analgesic effects were not restricted to any particular type of neuropathic pain. Patient compliance was high throughout the trial.

The objective was to summarise current evidence and provide recommendations on the use of antiplatelet agents in PAD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA consensus group was assembled including 20 specialists from a variety of fields involved in the management of patients with PAD. Data was circulated in a systematic manner prior to a main consensus meeting held in November 2001. The document subsequently produced was circulated within the group to ensure agreement in the interpretation and presentation of its findings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nConsensus recommendations are provided in 7 common or contentious scenarios in PAD. The recommendations are graded to reflect the evidence available and interpretations of the group. Although the document provides recommendations, it is stressed that they must be interpreted in the light of individual patient circumstances.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAntiplatelet agents have an important role in the management of patient with PAD. Although this document provides consensus recommendations, the optimum treatment in many scenarios remains unclear due to a lack of focussed clinical trials in PAD.", "outbound_citations": ["12087138", "12020175", "12020178", "11940542", "11909555", "11868040", "11786451", "11792343", "11809254", "11809180", "11851656", "11892730", "11752357", "11719417", "11695249", "11735194", "11520521", "11519503", "11412247", "11179262", "11170879", "11157638", "11157657", "11368702", "11156107", "10884487", "10868447", "10801370", "10601050", "10514209", "10510990", "10460632", "10393676", "10777239", "9737454", "10103353", "9561895", "9392698", "9400557", "9385493", "8973232", "8981292", "8664664", "8537210", "7879961", "7814784", "7974569", "7917683", "8017309", "8152898", "8320785", "8491012", "1514915", "1640649", "1783914", "1922220", "1917239", "2037083", "1987387", "1693474", "2187948", "2533210", "2724457", "3048155", "2967433", "3094806", "3556347", "3516608", "3514494", "2857803", "6474351", "6229934", "7102362", "6755786", "4131066"], "inbound_citations": ["35670082", "34192807", "29309910", "25358850"], "label": "0"}

With respect to the total effect of a single oral dose, the anti-exudative effect of meloxicam on carrageenan-induced oedema in the rat exceeded that of all the NSAIDs included in the comparison. Additionally, meloxicam showed the greatest potency of all the compounds examined with respect to adjuvant-induced arthritis in the rat, the granuloma pouch model and the cotton pellet test in the rat. Unlike indomethacin, in the carrageenan pleurisy model in the rat, meloxicam caused both a dose-dependent reduction in exudate volume and also inhibition of leucocyte migration. Meloxicam showed a strong and lasting effect on inflammatory pain in the rat. Like other NSAIDs, but unlike dipyrone, meloxicam had no effect in the hot plate and tail clamp tests, which are used to identify weak central analgesic effects. Unlike dipyrone and like indomethacin, meloxicam had no effect in a model of visceral distention pain. In common with other NSAIDs, meloxicam had no influence on the body temperature of normothermic rats in the anti-inflammatory dose range, but did reduce yeast-induced fever in the rat in a dose-dependent manner. Like piroxicam, meloxicam had a uricosuric effect on rats treated with oxonic acid. Low-dose meloxicam inhibited both bradykinin-induced and PAF-induced bronchospasm in the guinea-pig, but had no effect on acetylcholine-induced bronchospasm. Piroxicam had greater ulcerogenic effects in the rat stomach than meloxicam. The therapeutic range of meloxicam in the rat, with regard to inhibition of adjuvant arthritis, was several times greater than that of piroxicam, indomethacin, diclofenac and naproxen.", "outbound_citations": ["3354373", "7136957", "7155191", "8513840", "7909103", "8121485", "8477566", "8450417", "1381521", "1885900", "1698136", "2401186", "6150099", "6430375", "6440513", "7123233", "6767192", "791988", "995953", "769625", "1059088", "4719457", "5403978", "5770131", "5346672", "4385056", "5937395", "14066137", "14001233", "13694701", "13549054", "13037887", "14845693", "14802403", "13471093", "14858210", "13219024", "4328527"], "inbound_citations": ["36521690", "36364138", "36312332", "35203234", "33426024", "32164967", "32861748", "33077071", "32281899", "30905178", "31040220", "30786162", "30693494", "30774225", "30154656", "29946552", "30108972", "31986203", "29477521", "29680958", "29462895", "29736296", "29126721", "29181834", "28844846", "29256371", "28891702", "29037798", "28764448", "27080170", "27530823", "26916642", "26771245", "26130835", "25815572", "25563680", "25455386", "25405963", "25127632", "25325291", "24799355", "25141247", "24845457", "24871207"], "label": "0"}

Methods: We studied 216 patients (164 females and 52 males) who had suffered adverse reactions to one or more NSAIDs; 98 subjects (45.4%) had experienced reactions to only one NSAID (single hypersensitivity) and 118 subjects (54.6%) had reacted to multiple NSAIDs (multiple hypersensitivity). Cutaneous reactions were reported by 79.6% of the subjects, respiratory symptoms by 10.7%, cutaneous and respiratory symptoms by 8.3%, anaphylaxis by 1.4%. All the subjects underwent a single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge with divided therapeutic doses of rofecoxib (6.25 mg +18.75 mg 1 h later = cumulative dose of 25 mg). Results: No reactions to the placebo were observed; only 1 subject (0.46%) experienced an urticarial reaction, after the second dose of rofecoxib. Conclusions: Considering previous studies and our own data, rofecoxib was well tolerated by all of the 174 patients with exclusively NSAID-related respiratory symptoms. Rofecoxib also had a very low rate (1.6%) of cross-reactivity in the 600 patients with exclusively cutaneous reactions to NSAIDs.", "outbound_citations": ["12464059", "12487218", "12444322", "12141722", "12065343", "11940070", "11926629", "11576089", "11570615", "11551261", "11551246", "11488679", "11447381", "11251623", "11097321", "10875490", "10594488", "10400832", "9761020", "9236499", "9012626", "8121485", "1460195", "1849272", "3318575", "6436354", "6863206", "7316107", "6153688", "410857", "1277441", "1109660", "5284360"], "inbound_citations": ["31100553", "28385055"], "label": "0"}

The cost minimization model described in Federal Practitioner (1999;16[4]:41-44) was used to calculate the cost savings. The mean once-daily dosing rates and their 95% confidence intervals were determined by binomial data analysis. Calendar year 2001 utilization and cost projections were derived by linear regression trend analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCurrent VA system costs per dose are celecoxib 100 mg $0.66; celecoxib 200 mg $1.32; rofecoxib (12.5 or 25 mg) $1.32; rofecoxib 50 mg $2.14. During calendar year 2000, the VA spent $13.8 million and $4.2 million on celecoxib and rofecoxib, respectively. The percentage of once-daily or less than once-daily dosing was celecoxib 100 mg (17%), celecoxib 200 mg (67%), celecoxib overall (49%), rofecoxib 12.5 mg (86%), rofecoxib 25 mg (94%), rofecoxib 50 mg (100%), and rofecoxib overall (93%). Based on current utilization, if all celecoxib prescriptions were changed to rofecoxib, the VA would have realized annual cost savings of $2.1 million in calendar year 2000. In calendar year 2001, projected cost savings could total $5.2 million. This potential savings is largely due to the high prevalence of twice-daily celecoxib dosing.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of the cyclooxygenase-2 cost minimization analysis provide a compelling argument for the preferred use of rofecoxib in the VA system, and potentially in other managed care systems.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Recent reports, however, have determined that a significant proportion of patients undergoing TRUS-guided biopsies have pain. We performed a prospective randomized double-blind study of 56 men referred for TRUS biopsy of the prostate. They were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg of oral rofecoxib or placebo before TRUS biopsy. After the biopsies, the patients were asked to score the severity of pain by filling out a visual analog pain scale. At the end of 1 week, all patients were asked to mail in a questionnaire regarding the morbidity of the prostate biopsy, including dysuria, hematuria, urinary retention, postbiopsy fever, and rectal bleeding. Analysis was completed to assess whether rofecoxib decreased the patients' perception of pain. The postbiopsy morbidity of patients receiving placebo versus rofecoxib was compared. Thirty-seven percent of patients receiving placebo and 42% of patients receiving rofecoxib had significant pain (5 or greater on the visual analog pain scale). The median pain score of patients receiving rofecoxib (4.0) versus placebo (4.0) was not significantly different statistically (P = 0.3139) using a Wilcoxon rank sum analysis.

Clinically relevant upper gastrointestinal ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, or obstruction) and symptomatic ulcers during the first six months of treatment were described as the two main outcome measures, comparing incidence rates for celecoxib and a traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (fig 1). It was concluded that, compared with the traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, celecoxib \u201cwas associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications combined.\u201d3 The trial was funded by celecoxib's manufacturer Pharmacia.\n\nAn article in the Washington Post in August 20013 and two letters published in JAMA in November 2001 4 5 drew attention to the fact that complete information available to the United States Food and Drug Administration contradicted these conclusions.

This study analyzed the tolerability of the selective cyclooxygenase-2-inhibitor rofecoxib in patients who encountered pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\n37 patients (12 males, 25 females, mean age 35 years [15-75 years]) with a history of pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs underwent standardized skin prick, scratch and patch tests along with oral placebo-controlled blinded exposure to rofecoxib (maximum single dose 12.5 mg, cumulative dose 25 mg).\n\n\nRESULTS\n23 patients had skin reactions, 4 times respiratory symptoms were documented, and in 10 cases cutaneous as well as respiratory symptoms were reported. Salicylic acid was identified as the most common trigger for a pseudoallergic reaction (n = 28). In 9 cases several non-steroidal antiphlogistics of different chemical groups caused symptoms. All skin tests showed negative results. Oral challenge with rofecoxib was tolerated by all 37 patients without adverse effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGiven the high incidence of pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs the use of selective cyclooxygenase-2-inhibitors represents a therapeutic alternative as well as a means of prevention of the described reactions.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

We therefore investigated potential interactions between aspirin and commonly prescribed arthritis therapies\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe administered the following combinations of drugs for six days: aspirin (81 mg every morning) two hours before ibuprofen (400 mg every morning) and the same medications in the reverse order; aspirin two hours before acetaminophen (1000 mg every morning) and the same medications in the reverse order; aspirin two hours before the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (25 mg every morning) and the same medications in the reverse order; enteric-coated aspirin two hours before ibuprofen (400 mg three times a day); and enteric-coated aspirin two hours before delayed-release diclofenac (75 mg twice daily)\n\n\nRESULTS\nSerum thromboxane B(2) levels (an index of cyclooxygenase-1 activity in platelets) and platelet aggregation were maximally inhibited 24 hours after the administration of aspirin on day 6 in the subjects who took aspirin before a single daily dose of any other drug, as well as in those who took rofecoxib or acetaminophen before taking aspirin. In contrast, inhibition of serum thromboxane B(2) formation and platelet aggregation by aspirin was blocked when a single daily dose of ibuprofen was given before aspirin, as well as when multiple daily doses of ibuprofen were given. The concomitant administration of rofecoxib, acetaminophen, or diclofenac did not affect the pharmacodynamics of aspirin\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe concomitant administration of ibuprofen but not rofecoxib, acetaminophen, or diclofenac antagonizes the irreversible platelet inhibition induced by aspirin. Treatment with ibuprofen in patients with increased cardiovascular risk may limit the cardioprotective effects of aspirin.", "outbound_citations": ["11505178", "11496855", "11465710", "11185674", "11087881", "11028250", "10943882", "10874543", "10806603", "10693877", "11014340", "10639016", "10215647", "10225536", "9874808", "9822058", "9617032", "9351974", "8901870", "8718891", "8652509", "7552725", "7996488", "8121489", "8375421", "8477566", "8419003", "1892057", "1907252", "2664901", "3790723", "3933848", "3917387", "3983893", "6436696", "6539491", "6606361", "6411052", "6812166", "7045161", "7028786"], "inbound_citations": ["37176005", "37109738", "37123917", "36729588", "36558048", "36304162", "36095269", "36084151", "36185934", "35081420", "34130339", "34089908", "33706986", "33706984", "33614744", "33311678", "33230404", "33141613", "32761372", "32731930", "32796696", "32740860", "32645166", "32453611", "32252582", "32084058", "32251264", "32198292", "32181121", "32028608", "31943085", "31916080", "31957546", "31989083", "34752511", "31755383", "31302425", "31886147", "31465489", "31485978", "31301081", "31060007", "30324870", "31172862", "30912119", "30941845", "31406516", "30779982", "30477749", "30686119", "30439428", "30838040", "30535127", "30302763", "29964214", "30273676", "30538759", "30406348", "29847537", "30322371", "30386795", "30265320", "30251061", "30096158", "29936577", "29257747", "28526264", "28262342", "28747946", "28347710", "28293429", "27105311", "27188977", "27043127", "28191510", "26141932", "26621246", "25956433", "26404864", "26278818", "26225198", "25986598", "25963327", "25907917", "25263946", "25796279", "25861296", "25163728", "26288292", "25440752", "24866234", "24903101"], "label": "1"}

Recent evidence suggests that the primary inflammation occurs in a maxillary nerve segment, accessible intraorally. Local tenderness, related to symptom laterality, has been palpated consistently in asymptomatic migraine patients, and significant migraine relief has been obtained from chilling confined to this area. Thirty-five symptomatic episodic migraine patients were enrolled in this study, comparing 40 minutes of bilateral intraoral chilling, 50 mg of oral sumatriptan, and 40 minutes of sham (tongue) chilling. Hollow metal tubes chilled by circulating ice water were held in the maxillary molar periapical areas by the patient. Pain and nausea were recorded at baseline and 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours after start of treatment, using a numeric symptom-relief scale. Significant mean headache relief was obtained by maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at all four time intervals, with poor relief obtained by placebo. Maxillary chilling was more effective than sumatriptan at all four time intervals. Significant nausea relief was obtained by maxillary chilling and sumatriptan at posttreatment and 2 and 4 hours later. At 24 hours, some headache and nausea recurrence was noted with sumatriptan. The repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that both treatments, drug (P = 0.024) and maxillary chilling (P = 0.001), reduced the headache, as compared with the control group. Tenderness suggests local inflammation associated with vasodilatation and edema. Because chilling can resolve local edema, these findings raise the possibility that an intraoral inflammation may be a factor in migraine etiology.", "outbound_citations": ["11264686", "10759934", "10759926", "15613178", "9665056", "9563208", "9482363", "9127118", "8892141", "8604852", "7629361", "1559258", "1653136", "1699472", "2475821", "3282670", "3694267", "3881906", "6206779", "6663304", "6116859", "6931224", "14152626"], "inbound_citations": ["35596276", "33779525", "25623151"], "label": "0"}

We reviewed recently the potency of chemopreventive agents in the AOM rat model (D. E. Corpet and S. Tache, Nutr. Cancer, 43: 1-21, 2002). Here we add the results of a systematic review of the effect of dietary and chemopreventive agents on the tumor yield in Min mice. The review is based on the results of 179 studies from 71 articles and is displayed also on the internet http://corpet.net/min.(2) We compared the efficacy of agents in the Min mouse model and the AOM rat model, and found that they were correlated (r = 0.66; P < 0.001), although some agents that afford strong protection in the AOM rat and the Min mouse small bowel increase the tumor yield in the large bowel of mutant mice. The agents included piroxicam, sulindac, celecoxib, difluoromethylornithine, and polyethylene glycol. The reason for this discrepancy is not known. We also compare the results of rodent studies with those of clinical intervention studies of polyp recurrence. We found that the effect of most of the agents tested was consistent across the animal and clinical models. Our point is thus: rodent models can provide guidance in the selection of prevention approaches to human colon cancer, in particular they suggest that polyethylene glycol, hesperidin, protease inhibitor, sphingomyelin, physical exercise, epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor, (+)-catechin, resveratrol, fish oil, curcumin, caffeate, and thiosulfonate are likely important preventive agents.", "outbound_citations": ["11478486", "7749056", "12467130", "11932472", "11927003", "11854387", "11811948", "11823596", "11741743", "11830528", "11756224", "11782353", "11751386", "11729120", "11731407", "11585736", "11559543", "11848484", "11507063", "11424022", "11420398", "11323404", "11962247", "11588890", "11196148", "11205486", "11206275", "11090976", "11156379", "10969066", "11058617", "10974406", "11073017", "11039641", "11016626", "11016642", "10973323", "11245490", "10853036", "10874062", "10866310", "10866305", "10837006", "10783313", "10783317", "10770979", "10753194", "11034085", "10766173", "10680582", "11006375", "10660105", "10537289", "10506110", "10469614", "10472428", "10357789", "10213222", "10069468", "9887161", "9934849", "10025873", "9865728", "9791143", "9858896", "9734399", "9771930", "9751277", "9649126", "9558273", "9634050", "9617344", "9515794", "9458081", "9443401", "9589430", "9734400", "9363991", "9363998", "9331087", "9294187", "9228052", "9211858", "9157997", "9163695", "9111214", "9096389", "9041176", "9000559", "9101556", "8978062", "8945508", "8707313", "8653697", "8631000", "8630994", "8564967", "8561861", "7473832", "7585570", "7496216", "7882354", "7846077", "7586174", "7987819", "7881343", "8008027", "7730878", "8014110", "8453729", "8352890", "1473226", "1866311", "1831401", "2296722", "3293777", "731027", "PMC2150417", "PMC42730", "PMC5919493", "PMC23339", "PMC2536533", "PMC20365", "PMC5921824", "PMC5926978", "PMC1207726", "PMC2225537", "10770980", "PMC2551173", "11940469"], "inbound_citations": ["36890873", "35269660", "34359429", "32229665", "31960202", "31563626", "31641892", "30316137", "30405532", "30235302", "29954759", "29617381", "28948694", "29125219", "28718829", "28222396", "27913199", "28106049", "28538848", "27837314", "27638841", "27612418", "27413734", "27413734", "26893066", "26499368", "25799881", "25592152", "25657017", "25449147", "25584074", "25406879", "25280404", "25109257", "24825611", "24817032", "24901647", "24759931", "24934606"], "label": "0"}

The present meta-analyses explore the incidence of allergic reactions with celecoxib in patients in the North American and international arthritis trials, in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to sulfonamides, and in patients receiving medications containing sulfonamides. Data were obtained from 11,008 patients in 14 double-masked trials of celecoxib in arthritis ranging from 4 to 24 weeks in duration. Results demonstrate that the incidence of allergic reactions with celecoxib was not statistically different from that seen with placebo or active comparators (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) when data from the entire cohort were analyzed. The subset of patients with a history of sulfonamide hypersensitivity reactions had a 3-fold to 6-fold higher incidence of dermatologic reactions than did the entire arthritis trial cohort. Although dermatologic reactions occurred with greater frequency in patients with a history of sulfonamide hypersensitivity, the trend was consistent across all 3 treatment groups (celecoxib, NSAIDs, and placebo). According to these data and structural and metabolic differences between sulfonamides, the potential for cross-allergenicity between celecoxib and other sulfonamide-containing medications appears comparable to that of placebo and nonsulfonamide-containing NSAIDs. Additionally, the risk of allergic reactions with celecoxib appears comparable to that of placebo and comparator NSAIDs. Prospective trials are needed to confirm these findings.", "outbound_citations": ["9949762", "10193998", "9761025", "9751091", "9756186", "9533069", "9135032", "8920632", "7835691", "7798534", "7794310", "1955637", "3237218", "3668117", "3477129", "2434548", "3729200"], "inbound_citations": ["34003717", "31495421", "29876667", "27796328", "27272369"], "label": "1"}

Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents (at present corticosteroids, cromoglycate and nedocromil) are the first-line treatment for this condition. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and indomethacin, however, have never been used in this setting, mainly for fear of adverse effects (e.g. severe obstructive reactions); these can occur, in a consistent number of patients as a consequence (according to the most widely accepted theory) of inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. In a double-blind crossover placebo-controlled study involving 20 aspirin-sensitive patients with asthma, we found that oral nimesulide 100mg was well tolerated both clinically and functionally (no significant changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second and specific airway resistance after drug intake). In a more recent study, we observed a mild obstructive reaction (easily controlled with inhaled bronchodilators) after oral administration of nimesulide 400mg to 3 patients who had previously tolerated a 100mg dose.

In previous studies, meloxicam has been found to be safe and effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) at doses of 7.5 to 15 mg daily. To evaluate a lower dose and a different patient population, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of meloxicam vs placebo and diclofenac for the treatment of OA among patients with symptom exacerbations.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicenter study, 774 patients with confirmed OA of the hip or knee and a flare were randomized and treated with daily oral administration of meloxicam tablets (at dosages of 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg/d), diclofenac (100 mg [50 mg twice daily]), or placebo. Treatment was for 12 weeks, with regular assessments for drug safety and efficacy. Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory data. Primary efficacy variables included the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index, the patient's overall assessment of pain, and the patient's and investigator's overall assessment of disease activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of all adverse events was lower at each dosage of meloxicam than for diclofenac but greater than for placebo. However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and dropout rates because of such events was the same for meloxicam as for placebo and lower than for diclofenac. Meloxicam, at 7.5 and 15 mg/d, and diclofenac were statistically significantly more effective than placebo for all end points, while the 3.75-mg/d dosage of meloxicam did not always reach statistical significance for all end points. Efficacy was evident after 2 weeks of treatment, improved with increasing doses, and was maintained until the end of the trial.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMeloxicam is a safe and effective medication for the symptomatic treatment of OA. The data support consideration of 7.5 to 15 mg of meloxicam once daily to treat the pain and stiffness of OA, with gastrointestinal tolerability comparable to that of placebo.

Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme is the basis for both the efficacy and toxicity of NSAIDs. The discovery of two COX isoforms, constitutive COX-1 and inducible COX-2, has led to the hypothesis that selective inhibition of COX-2 will minimize the potential for GI toxicity without compromising efficacy. The Meloxicam Large-scale International Study Safety Assessment (MELISSA) trial reported here was therefore set up to investigate the tolerability of meloxicam, a preferential inhibitor of COX-2, compared to diclofenac. MELISSA was a large-scale, double-blind, randomized, international, prospective trial, conducted over 28 days in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis. Patients received either meloxicam 7.5 mg or diclofenac 100 mg slow release, the recommended doses for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Evaluation of the profile of adverse events was the main aim of the trial, together with assessment of efficacy. A total of 9323 patients received treatment (4635 and 4688 in the meloxicam and diclofenac groups, respectively). Significantly fewer adverse events were reported by patients receiving meloxicam. This was attributable to fewer GI adverse events (13%) compared to diclofenac (19%; P < 0.001). Of the most common GI adverse events, there was significantly less dyspepsia (P < 0.001), nausea and vomiting (P < 0.05), abdominal pain (P < 0.001) and diarrhoea (P < 0.001) with meloxicam compared to diclofenac. Five patients on meloxicam experienced a perforation, ulcer or bleed vs seven on diclofenac (not significant). No endoscopically verified ulcer complication was detected in the meloxicam group compared to four with diclofenac. There were five patient days of hospitalization in patients on meloxicam compared to 121 with diclofenac. Adverse events caused withdrawal from the study in 254 patients receiving meloxicam (5.48%) compared to 373 (7.96%) on diclofenac (P < 0.001). These differences were attributable to differences in reported GI adverse events (3.02% on meloxicam vs 6.14% on diclofenac; P < 0.001). Differences in efficacy, as assessed by visual analogue scales, consistently favoured diclofenac. In all instances, 95% confidence intervals did not cross zero, suggesting a statistically significant effect. However, differences were small (4.5-9.01% difference) and did not reach pre-determined levels of clinical significance. Nevertheless, significantly more patients discontinued meloxicam because of lack of efficacy (80 out of 4635 vs 49 out of 4688; P < 0.01). The MELISSA trial confirms earlier studies suggesting that meloxicam has a significantly improved GI tolerability profile in comparison with other NSAIDs, including diclofenac. These results may in part reflect the preferential COX-2 selectivity of meloxicam, although the dose and other aspects of tolerability may be important. These results may provide support for the hypothesis that selective inhibition of COX-2 relative to COX-1 might be an effective approach towards improved NSAID therapy.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37003655", "35904290", "34137514", "34156022", "32929934", "32790977", "31301566", "32002263", "30737315", "31176028", "30774225", "30315290", "28635891", "27845312", "26860018", "26448006", "25994306", "24958457", "25004022"], "label": "1"}

These are based on better understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases, re-evaluation of previous therapeutic concepts such as combination therapy, and developments within biotechnology. There are 4 main areas of development, mainly involving the treatment of inflammatory synovitis. The first is with anti-inflammatory drugs, where there has been a focus on reducing gastrointestinal toxicity through the use of combination preparations such as diclofenac-misoprostol, and the introduction of drugs with more selectivity for cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibition such as meloxicam. An additional approach has been the development of anti-inflammatory drugs such as tenidap which also control cytokine metabolism. The second area is slow-acting antirheumatic drugs with the introduction of cyclosporin as a single agent or in combination with methotrexate, the development of immunomodulating drugs such as leflunomide, and the demonstration that some antibiotics such as minocycline have slow-acting effects. The third area is the use of corticosteroids including the development of deflazacort as a bone sparing agent, the greater use of intramuscular depot steroids and the validation of low-dose oral corticosteroids in early rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, there have been advances in the biotechnology area with the demonstration that cytokine immunotherapy such as antibodies to tumour necrosis factor can rapidly improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and that T cell immunotherapy with antibodies to the CD4 receptor may be effective in reducing synovitis. Many of these agents have not yet been introduced into clinical practice but they show the diversity of drug development and suggest the likelihood of major therapeutic benefits in the next few years.", "outbound_citations": ["9153537", "8564518", "7664022", "2058454", "8235288", "8322168", "8694659", "8664664", "8651963", "8733435", "8630632", "8607888", "8534265", "8546737", "8546738", "8534264", "8628980", "7575694", "7615202", "8521761", "7791814", "7791815", "7612039", "7732162", "7742156", "7993000", "7992990", "7647428", "7934491", "7950736", "7934495", "7839158", "7945476", "7945477", "8020659", "7912930", "7932425", "7911664", "8060767", "8036523", "7516430", "7532319", "8185689", "8265610", "8250987", "8239849", "8220939", "8278816", "8278817", "8378772", "8255975", "8356999", "8210582", "8507213", "8100702", "8495276", "8477124", "8478880", "8478864", "8452578", "8448639", "8094123", "8356260", "8434246", "8441172", "8004218", "1345138", "1450797", "1334514", "1418003", "1464862", "1417145", "1593608", "1576063", "1734902", "1734901", "1729367", "1540033", "2052056", "1750898", "1847289", "2202458", "2198977", "1970370", "2313671", "3281603", "3277682", "3873420", "7097681", "5284360", "13193215", "7768058", "7488280"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Of the former, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used, and newer agents with cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) specific inhibition may have fewer renal side effects compared to non-selective NSAIDs. We therefore investigated whether combination of a COX-2 inhibitor with an angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor blocker is safe with regard to preservation of normal renal function in a state of slight volume contraction.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMild volume depletion was induced by a salt-restricted diet in 5 healthy volunteers who were then given a single dose of 400 mg celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, alone or in combination with 150 mg irbesartan, an AT1 receptor blocker. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were determined by measuring inulin and PAH clearance respectively, along with plasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary electrolyte excretion before and over 100 minutes after drug administration.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPRA was high prior to drug administration, indicating slight salt depletion, and dropped by 65% after intake of celecoxib alone (p = 0.008) but only by 25% after combined intake with irbesartan (p = n.s.). GFR was not affected either by celecoxib alone or by combined administration with irbesartan. In contrast, ERPF increased by 28% 80 minutes after simultaneous drug intake (p = 0.029), but not after celecoxib alone. Renal sodium and potassium excretion did not significantly change under celecoxib alone or in combination with irbesartan.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSelective COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib in combination with an AT1 receptor blocker (irbesartan) has no acute adverse effects on renal haemodynamics and renal salt handling in slightly volume-depleted subjects with normal renal function. Moreover, our data obtained in humans appear to confirm the co-regulatory interaction of COX-2 and angiotensin II in the control of renin release, as suggested by animal studies.", "outbound_citations": ["10580457", "10541298", "10555568", "10489401", "10430112", "10377455", "10194467", "29591815", "9350647", "9140046", "8853429", "8555245", "8777562", "8274023", "8238387", "1712772", "1849272", "2120205", "2120289", "2493647", "3045550", "3306093", "6361570", "20258393"], "inbound_citations": ["36471394", "27490717"], "label": "0"}

The high incidence and mortality make effective prevention an important public-health and economic issue. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis and are among the few agents known to be chemopreventive. Randomised trials have shown that sulindac and celecoxib suppress the development of adenomatous polyps and cause regression of existing polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), who have a high risk for developing colorectal cancer. The mechanisms by which NSAIDs inhibit neoplastic growth are not fully known. Two recently reported randomised placebo-controlled trials show a chemopreventive effect of aspirin in populations other than those with FAP (Robert Sandler and colleagues, N Engl J Med 2003; 348: 883-90; John Baron and colleagues, N Engl J Med 2003; 348: 891-99). In the Sandler study 635 patients with colorectal cancer were randomised to receive 325 mg aspirin or placebo daily. After a follow-up of around 31 months, the mean number of adenomas was lower in the aspirin group than in the placebo group, corresponding to a relative risk of any recurrent adenoma in the aspirin group of 0.65. In the Baron study 1121 patients with colorectal adenomas were assigned to receive 81 or 325 mg aspirin or placebo daily. Follow-up colonoscopy, 32 months after the index endoscopy, showed an incidence of one or more adenomas of 38% in the 81 mg aspirin group, 45% in the 325 mg aspirin group, and 47% in the placebo group. Together, these studies indicate a moderate chemopreventive effect of aspirin in populations with an intermediate risk of developing colorectal cancer. WHERE NEXT? The anticancer properties of NSAIDs have been demonstrated in vitro and in animal studies, epidemiological reports, and intervention studies. Several mechanisms through which NSAIDs alter colonic carcinogenesis have been elucidated, including the induction of apoptosis in neoplastic cells, via mechanisms dependent and independent of cyclo-oxygenase. Some studies have suggested an important role for the cell-cycle regulating protein p21 in mediating the chemopreventive effect of sulindac. A decrease in p21 expression may be one of the main oncogenic events in the development of colorectal cancer. Thus p21 could be the molecular link in the chemopreventive effects of NSAIDs.", "outbound_citations": ["12885482", "12621132", "11932472", "11902503", "11854387", "12408868", "11283619", "11283620", "11226292", "11507085", "11057903", "10874062", "9697701", "9065401", "9065402", "8945508", "8861899", "8694848", "8632912", "7698575", "8298943", "8505985", "8385741", "1650315", "2188735"], "inbound_citations": ["36765706", "33546238", "33275396", "33031275", "30841568", "29678446", "29938466", "28587975", "32454624", "26025205", "26219912", "26366089", "26021807", "26135128", "25102912"], "label": "0"}

A 6-week placebo-controlled trial in 736 patients compared 12.5 and 25 mg of rofecoxib once daily with 800 mg of ibuprofen 3 times daily, and a 1-year study compared 12.5 and 25 mg of rofecoxib once daily with 50 mg of diclofenac 3 times daily in 693 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRofecoxib, at 12.5 and 25 mg, demonstrated efficacy clinically comparable with ibuprofen, assessed by 3 primary end points according to predefined comparability criteria. Both rofecoxib doses and ibuprofen provided significantly greater efficacy than placebo on all primary end points at 6 weeks. Both rofecoxib doses and diclofenac showed similar efficacy over 1 year. All treatments were well tolerated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRofecoxib is effective in treating OA with once-daily dosing for 6 weeks and 1 year.

Compared with individual endpoints, a composite measure might (1) provide a uniform outcome measure of OA efficacy with greater face validity, (2) address multiplicity, and (3) enhance precision. Combinations of endpoints were analyzed to investigate precision of composite measures of OA efficacy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe reanalyzed three 6 week, placebo controlled, double blind, parallel group studies (2 by the same protocol) of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor rofecoxib. The average change from baseline at study weeks 2, 4, and 6 was assessed for 10 individual response variables, including patient and investigator global assessments, WOMAC 3.0V OA Index pain, stiffness and physical function subscales, graded study joint tenderness, and rescue analgesic use. Relationships among variables were evaluated using pairwise correlations and principal components analysis. The precision of variables to differentiate rofecoxib from placebo was evaluated using effect size (i.e., mean difference between rofecoxib versus placebo divided by pooled SD).\n\n\nRESULTS\nCorrelations among all pairs of response variables ranged from 0.5 to 0.9, except those with tenderness (0.4 to 0.6) and those with analgesic use (0.2 to 0.4). The first principal component explained about 70% of the total variability, with weights generally similar (0.17 for rescue analgesic use, 0.25 for tenderness, and 0.30 to 0.37 for the others). These results indicate that nearly all measures are closely related. Based on these results, various linear combinations of the 9 endpoints were formed and their precision to discriminate active treatment from placebo was compared to that of the individual endpoints. Effect sizes of the individual endpoints ranged from 0.6 to 1.1; those of the composites from 0.7 to 0.9. The results were very consistent between study protocols.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn comparison to individual endpoints, composite analyses of OA clinical endpoints do not increase precision to discriminate active treatment from placebo.", "outbound_citations": ["10871971", "10513802", "7488277", "7779114", "6534410"], "inbound_citations": ["34606077", "24833282"], "label": "0"}

As with any other acute treatment for migraine, headache recurrence may occur in up to one-third of responders. Combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to reduce the incidence of headache recurrence in clinical practice. Rofecoxib is a member of a new class of NSAIDs, which selectively inhibits the COX-2 enzyme and therefore is associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal side-effects; the drug has a long plasma half-life (17 h). This open label study compared rizatriptan with rizatriptan plus rofecoxib in the acute treatment of migraine. Fifty-six triptan naive patients from a tertiary centre (37 women and 19 men, ages 16-55 years, mean 35 years) with International Headache Society migraine were randomized into two groups. They were instructed to treat three consecutive moderate or severe attacks with either 10 mg rizatriptan (group 1: 18 women and 10 men) or with 10 mg rizatriptan plus 25 mg rofecoxib (group 2: 19 women and 9 men). The presence of headache and nausea at 1, 2 and 4 h, and of side-effects, use of rescue medication and recurrence were compared. Fifty-four patients completed the study. Group 1 treated 76 attacks and group 2 treated 81 attacks. Absence of headache at 1 h was seen in 19 attacks (25%) in group 1 and in 34 attacks (42%) in group 2 (P = 0.082); at 2 h absence of headache was seen in 60% of group 1 attacks and in 76% of group 2 attacks (P = 0.115).

With regard to nausea, of those who had nausea at baseline, 31% and 49% of attacks in groups 1 and 2, respectively, were nausea free at 1 h (P = 0.091), 75% and 79% at 2 h (P = 0.736) and 82% and 91% (P = 0.479) at 4 h. Recurrence, based on all attacks of those patients who achieved pain free at 4 h, was observed in 53% of group 1 and 20% of group 2 attacks (P< 0.001). Sustained pain- free rates (for the 4-h time point) were 45.6% of group 1 and 78.9% of group 2 attacks. There were no significant differences with regard to rescue medication consumption after 4 h and side-effects in both groups. There was a non-significant trend for the combination group to have a higher response rate. The group treated with rizatriptan and rofecoxib had a lower recurrence rate than the group treated with rizatriptan. This study demonstrated that combining a fast acting triptan such as rizatriptan with rofecoxib reduced headache recurrence rates, was well tolerated and may be more effective than the use of rizatriptan alone. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary to confirm these observations.", "outbound_citations": ["11422095", "11299430", "11087881", "11115219", "10920403", "10580458", "10234467", "10099848", "11284463", "9827244", "9595867", "9504998", "9229578"], "inbound_citations": ["31446449", "31563229", "27957624", "25773005", "25659588", "25056381", "24363238"], "label": "0"}

This article reviews recent progress in disease\u2010modifying therapy for spondyloarthropathy, including new biologic response modifiers, such as the tumor necrosis factor\u2010&agr; inhibitors etanercept and infliximab.", "outbound_citations": ["12428262", "12428223", "12379628", "12382299", "12233885", "12079908", "11986408", "12022358", "12020219", "11955536", "11961174", "11874830", "11874832", "11920412", "11920400", "11920395", "11920413", "11830446", "11830424", "11840464", "12046813", "11892697", "11824947", "11665993", "11566619", "11474662", "11469469", "11409115", "11407702", "11156548", "11336570", "11212159", "11196517", "11596589", "11212158", "10958782", "10972371", "10857793", "10857783", "10834859", "10666170", "10730214", "10622295", "10555027", "10228190", "10088786", "10025933", "9924213", "9798608", "9712099", "9712241", "9609749", "9353151", "9247454", "9219699", "9058659", "9204257", "9117172", "8961906", "8843861", "8864578", "8592949", "7748217", "7667201", "7934491", "7511650", "7921752", "8496685", "1828327", "2260998", "2901839", "4084327", "357213"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

The authors determined risk factors for NSAID-related clinical upper GI events and the event rates, absolute risk reductions, and numbers needed to treat for individual risk factors for a nonselective NSAID and a selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor in a double-blind outcomes trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEight thousand seventy-six rheumatoid arthritis patients aged >or=50 years (or >or=40 on corticosteroid therapy) were randomly assigned to rofecoxib 50 mg daily or naproxen 500 mg twice daily for a median of 9 months. The development of clinical upper GI events (bleeding, perforation, obstruction, and symptomatic ulcer identified on clinically indicated work-up) was assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSignificant risk factors included prior upper GI events, age >or=65, and severe rheumatoid arthritis (RR, 2.3-3.9). Patients administered naproxen who had prior upper GI complications or who were aged >or=75 years had 18.84 or 14.46 events per 100 patient-years, and the risk of events remained constant over time. The reduction in events with rofecoxib was similar in high- and low-risk subgroups (RR, 0.31-0.68). The number needed to treat with rofecoxib instead of naproxen to avert 1 GI event was 10-12 in highest risk patients (prior event, age >or=75 years, or severe rheumatoid arthritis), 17-33 in patients with other risk factors, and 42-106 in low-risk patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNSAID-related GI events increase dramatically with risk factors such as prior events or older age.

Patients were randomized to receive placebo, 200 microg of misoprostol 4 times a day, or 15 or 30 mg of lansoprazole once daily for 12 weeks. Ulcer status was determined by endoscopy at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients receiving lansoprazole (15 or 30 mg) remained free from gastric ulcer longer than those who received placebo (P<.001) but for a shorter time than those who received misoprostol. By week 12, the percentages of gastric ulcer-free patients were as follows: placebo, 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.1%-61.3%); misoprostol, 93% (95% CI, 87.2%-97.9%); 15-mg lansoprazole, 80% (95% CI, 72.5%-87.3%); and 30-mg lansoprazole, 82% (95% CI, 75.0%-89.6%). A significantly higher proportion of patients in the misoprostol group reported treatment-related adverse events and early withdrawal from the study. When the impact of withdrawals on ulcer development was considered (as failures), therapy was successful for 69% for each of the active treatment groups and 35% for the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nProton pump inhibitors such as lansoprazole are superior to placebo for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers but not superior to misoprostol, 800 microg/d. When the poor compliance and potential adverse effects associated with misoprostol are considered, proton pump inhibitors and full-dose misoprostol are clinically equivalent.", "outbound_citations": ["9539636", "11822005", "11204993", "24383526", "10223377", "9494149", "9882027", "9726386", "9572317", "9494148", "9305482", "9178671", "9178711", "8992334", "8827022", "8791962", "8618582", "8598839", "8607484", "8855725", "7625622", "7611589", "7599335", "8017742", "8328732", "8482449", "2238754", "2642452", "2904006", "3142593"], "inbound_citations": ["36375487", "37146633", "34376069", "33820460", "33307116", "33234769", "33085015", "33065578", "32094057", "32063071", "31578179", "30919492", "31199288", "30361857", "30828557", "29870582", "29928158", "29204620", "28988197", "28442261", "28638885", "28076696", "27937054", "27652576", "27919112", "27235617", "27312830", "27168132", "27003828", "26775657", "26447889", "26421118", "25824392", "26441478", "24871787"], "label": "1"}

However, very limited data are available on the influence of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors on the disposition of CYP2D6 substrates in humans. Therefore the objective of this study was to examine the effect of celecoxib and rofecoxib on the pharmacokinetics of the clinically relevant CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol. An open, randomized, 3-period crossover study was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers. Metoprolol (50 mg) was given in all 3 periods without or after 7 days of pretreatment with celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) or rofecoxib (25 mg daily) to achieve steady-state conditions of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors in periods 2 and 3. Celecoxib significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of metoprolol from 271 to 414 micro g. h/L (64% +/- 57%, P <.001) and by more than 200% in 1 volunteer. The extent of this drug interaction was more pronounced in volunteers with 2 fully functional alleles compared with volunteers with 1 fully functional allele (103% +/- 75% versus 36% +/- 23%, P <.05). After administration of celecoxib, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol decreased significantly from 474 to 387 micro g. h/L (P <.01). Rofecoxib caused no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. We conclude that celecoxib inhibits the metabolism of the CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol but that rofecoxib does not.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used analgesic agents in ambulatory patients. In recent studies, the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor rofecoxib demonstrated analgesic effects similar to those of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea. The present randomized, single-dose, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group study was undertaken to compare the analgesic efficacy of the COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib 50 mg and celecoxib 200 mg with that of ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo in patients with postoperative dental pain. Two hundred and seventy-two patients experiencing pain after the removal of > or =2 third molars were randomized according to pain severity (moderate vs severe) to receive a single dose of placebo (n = 45), rofecoxib 50 mg (n = 90), celecoxib 200 mg (n = 91), or ibuprofen 400 mg (n = 46). Using a patient diary, patients recorded pain intensity, pain relief, and global evaluations throughout the 24-hour period after dosing. The overall analgesic effect, onset of action, peak effect, and duration of effect were evaluated, with the primary end point being total pain relief over 8 hours (TOPAR8). The safety profile was assessed on the basis of physical findings, laboratory results, and spontaneous reports of adverse experiences. The results showed that compared with celecoxib, rofecoxib had superior analgesic effects on all measures of analgesic efficacy, including overall analgesic effect (TOPAR8, 18.3 vs. 12.5; P<0.001), time to onset of effect (30 vs. 60 minutes; P = 0.003), peak pain relief (score, 2.8 vs 2.3; P<0.05), and duration of effect (>24 vs. 5.1 hours; P<0.001). In addition, rofecoxib's analgesic efficacy was similar to that of ibuprofen (TOPAR8, 18.3 vs. 17.0; P = 0.460), but the duration was longer (P<0.05); with ibuprofen, the time to on set was 24 minutes, peak pain relief score was 2.9, and duration of analgesic effect was 8.9 hours. The safety profile was similar across all treatment groups. Thus rofecoxib provided analgesic efficacy superior to that of celecoxib and comparable to that of ibuprofen in the treatment of patients with acute postoperative dental pain.", "outbound_citations": ["10411562", "10096266", "9751091", "9710884", "9469523", "9065377", "8038702", "8454631", "1903657", "3522030", "6465164"], "inbound_citations": ["35322698", "34192584", "33868227", "33850866", "31016540", "31406516", "29569951", "29329493", "27806251", "24294889"], "label": "0"}

So far, the strategy of selective COX-2 inhibition has been successful. Selective COX-2 inhibitors have significantly less gastrotoxicity and no effects on platelet aggregation. However, with regard to renal adverse events, selective COX-2 inhibitors do not offer a clinically relevant advantage over non-selective inhibitors. Moreover, concerns over the cardiovascular risk of selective COX-2 inhibitors have recently been raised. The second generation of COX-2 inhibitors with higher COX-2 selectivity was developed with the promise of further reduction of NSAID-typical adverse effects. The leading compounds are valdecoxib, parecoxib, etoricoxib and lumaricoxib. At the present time they have proven efficacy for the treatment of pain and inflammation. Parecoxib as a parenteral, highly selective COX-2 inhibitor has the potential to become the NSAID of choice for treatment of postoperative pain. In clinical trials, valdecoxib, parecoxib, etoricoxib and lumaricoxib have caused no more endoscopic ulcers than placebo. However, to date, no data on the clinically relevant endpoints perforation, symptomatic ulcer and bleeding are available. Furthermore, no definite conclusions on renal and cardiovascular safety are possible. Current evidence points to a marginal, if any, gain of safety compared with the first generation of COX-2 inhibitors. However, trials with the new COX-2 inhibitors offer the chance to address these open questions of highly selective COX-2 inhibition; that is, thrombogenic risk, sodium and water retention, and interference with tissue repair, in particular, healing of mucosal damage.", "outbound_citations": ["11277028", "12151162", "11353749", "1712772", "11808971", "12198057", "9874808", "12362101", "12151917", "10979111", "11052577", "10794682", "12218521", "12100776", "11160644", "11950252", "9858421", "12180720", "9135032", "11696466", "12017209", "11717412", "12077033", "7909094", "10749518", "1907252", "11028754", "11102561", "11753007", "10715145", "11465874", "10643694", "12083587", "11782819", "11897923", "11327589", "10493277", "11509060", "12209034", "12209041", "3068365", "10215647", "5284360", "8121485", "11583479", "9114728", "9337382", "1849272", "11496855", "9490387", "11087881", "2120289", "12036167"], "inbound_citations": ["29346320", "28644089", "26053953", "25222148", "24087846"], "label": "0"}

After a 7-day washout, subjects were crossed over to receive the other regimen.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter the first dose, the trend was for a greater decrease in glomerular filtration rate with naproxen (-5.31 mL/min per 1.73 m2) compared with celecoxib (-0.86 mL/min per 1.73 m2). The treatment difference became statistically significant on day 6 (-7.53 vs -1.11 mL/min per 1.73 m2 for naproxen and celecoxib, respectively; P=.004). Urinary prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha excretion was significantly reduced from baseline across the treatment interval with both celecoxib and naproxen (P< or =.04). There were no significant differences in prostaglandin excretion between these 2 agents (P> or =.07). Small, transient decreases (P<.05) in urinary sodium excretion were observed after the initiation of both celecoxib and naproxen treatment. Sodium excretion values returned to baseline by the end of the study.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results indicate that cyclooxygenase 2-specific inhibition in healthy elderly subjects may spare renal hemodynamic function, although the effects on sodium excretion, as well as urinary prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha excretion, appear to be similar to those of nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as naproxen.", "outbound_citations": ["10826460", "10826475", "10826451", "10772629", "10390127", "10390124", "10390125", "10390123", "10215647", "9874808", "9789947", "9751091", "9737710", "9536101", "9438649", "9323006", "9431475", "9249646", "9140046", "8690211", "7832763", "7989609", "7972034", "8365485", "1540783", "1411912", "2058870", "2203262", "2183665", "3066625", "3337599", "3306093", "3530166", "3514734", "6860044", "5115749"], "inbound_citations": ["36201921", "35234840", "35139129", "34976524", "34833010", "33254637", "31732272", "31655781", "31480335", "30838041", "30345815", "29505772", "29202670", "28764659", "26945352", "26323378", "25665235"], "label": "0"}

The TAX 317 trial found that patients treated with docetaxel (Taxotere\u00ae) 75 mg/m2 had significantly longer survival than those treated with best supportive care alone. In addition, symptom control was better for patients who received chemotherapy. The TAX 320 trial found that treatment with docetaxel 75or 100 mg/m2resulted in significantly higher response rates than treatment with vinorelbine (Navelbine\u00ae) or ifosfamide (Mitoxana\u00ae), and the 1-year survival rate was also significantly better for patients treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2. A large randomized trial compared pemetrexed (LY-231514 or Alimta\u00ae) 500 mg/m2 with docetaxel 75 mg/m2. Response and survival rates were similar in the two treatment arms, however, the toxicity profile of pemetrexed was superior to that of docetaxel with significantly less Grade 3/4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Fewer patients in the pemetrexed arm required hospitalization. Topotecan (Hycamtin\u00ae) 2.3 mg/m2/day orally for 5 days has been compared with docetaxel 75 mg/m2in a large 800-patient study. The results of this trial are awaited. Gemcitabine (Gemzar\u00ae) and irinotecan (Campto\u00ae) have been evaluated both as single agents and in combination with each other and study results do not suggest that either of these drugs is superior to docetaxel or pemetrexed. The vinca alkaloid vinorelbine has proved to be inferior to docetaxel in a randomized trial. The epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa\u00ae) and erlotinib (CP-358774, OSI 774, Tarceva\u00ae) have been evaluated in Phase II trials in the second- and third-line setting.

Methods and perspective: A decision analytical model was used to compare the effects of 4 weeks' treatment of osteoarthritis with meloxicam (7.5 mg/day), diclofenac (100 mg/day) and piroxicam (20 mg/day). The decision tree was derived by combining best practice and clinical reality. Analysis was from the NHS perspective. The study considered only the direct costs. These included costs for drug acquisition and management of all adverse events, both serious gastrointestinal events requiring hospitalisation, and non-serious events that required maintenance. Resource use and treatment costs were obtained from local and published sources. A range of sensitivity analyses was carried out. Based on two 4-week large-scale trials, the Meloxicam Large-scale International Study Safety Assessment (MELISSA) and Safety and Efficacy Large-scale Evaluation of COX-inhibiting Therapies (SELECT) trials, and a decision analytical model, the findings suggested that meloxicam had the lowest cost per patient ( pound 30 versus pound 35 for piroxicam and pound 51 for diclofenac [costs presented as 1998 values except for drug costs which were in 2000 values]). The results of the Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis, using 4000 samples, suggested that meloxicam was the optimal strategy in the drug treatment of patients with osteoarthritis compared with nonselective NSAIDs both individually and as a group. The cost savings were due to lower levels of serious adverse events accompanied by fewer days in intensive care units and shorter overall duration of hospital stay observed with meloxicam compared with diclofenac and piroxicam in the 4-week trials. Based on the 4-week trial period, meloxicam was predicted to be the lowest cost drug therapy, and thus the optimal drug therapy, in the management of patients with osteoarthritis compared with nonselective NSAIDs such as diclofenac and piroxicam. Applying the cost savings per patient derived from the model, switching patients from piroxicam and diclofenac to meloxicam would indicate a cost saving of over pound 25 million per annum. Models such as this can facilitate better clinical guidance and is a useful way of assessing treatment outcomes.", "outbound_citations": ["10623364", "11280102", "11280106", "11301685", "10930388", "10817549", "10644275", "10750251", "10796306", "10628592", "10628597", "10628593", "10500058", "10377455", "10369853", "9783758", "9783757", "9715832", "9572315", "9558445", "9249647", "9146759", "9084574", "9229573", "8121485", "8118454", "8803564", "9929039"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

However, by decreasing vasodilatory and antiaggregatory prostacyclin production, COX-2 antagonists may lead to increased prothrombotic activity. To define the cardiovascular effects of COX-2 inhibitors when used for arthritis and musculoskeletal pain in patients without coronary artery disease, we performed a MEDLINE search to identify all English-language articles on use of COX-2 inhibitors published between 1998 and February 2001. We also reviewed relevant submissions to the US Food and Drug Administration by pharmaceutical companies. Our search yielded 2 major randomized trials, the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research Study (VIGOR; 8076 patients) and the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS; 8059 patients), as well as 2 smaller trials with approximately 1000 patients each. The results from VIGOR showed that the relative risk of developing a confirmed adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cardiac thrombus, resuscitated cardiac arrest, sudden or unexplained death, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attacks) with rofecoxib treatment compared with naproxen was 2.38 (95% confidence interval, 1.39-4.00; P =.002). There was no significant difference in cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) rates between celecoxib and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in CLASS. The annualized myocardial infarction rates for COX-2 inhibitors in both VIGOR and CLASS were significantly higher than that in the placebo group of a recent meta-analysis of 23 407 patients in primary prevention trials (0.52%): 0.74% with rofecoxib (P =.04 compared with the placebo group of the meta-analysis) and 0.80% with celecoxib (P =.02 compared with the placebo group of the meta-analysis). The available data raise a cautionary flag about the risk of cardiovascular events with COX-2 inhibitors.

Traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both isoenzymes, resulting in damage to the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum, but also in cardioprotection. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are less likely to damage the upper gastrointestinal tract, as has been shown by large, randomized, controlled trials. Specifically, the newer agents are superior to ibuprofen and naproxen in this regard, but celecoxib and diclofenac were not significantly different in patients who were not also taking low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. These studies did not include a placebo arm, however, and controlled comparisons of COX-2 inhibitors with placebo have not enlisted enough subjects to demonstrate conclusively that they are equally safe. Selectivity for the COX-2 isoform affords protection against upper gastrointestinal toxicity possibly at the expense of the cardioprotective effect of traditional NSAIDs. This might explain the higher rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients who are given rofecoxib compared with naproxen.

No studies have directly compared the analgesic efficacy of different doses of celecoxib for the prevention of postoperative pain. In this prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we compared oral celecoxib 200 mg to 400 mg when administered for premedication of outpatients undergoing minor ear-nose-throat surgery. A total of 93 healthy outpatients were assigned to 1 of 3 study groups: control (placebo; n = 30), celecoxib 200 mg (n = 30), or celecoxib 400 mg (n = 33). The study drug was given orally 30\u201345 min before surgery, and all patients received a standardized general anesthetic technique. During the postoperative period, pain scores (0\u201310), recovery times, the need for rescue analgesics, quality of recovery (0\u2013100), patient satisfaction with pain management (0\u2013100), and side effects were recorded. Pain was assessed at 30-min intervals using a verbal rating scale, with 0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable, in the postanesthesia care unit and day surgery unit recovery areas and at 24 h after surgery. Celecoxib 400 mg was significantly more effective than 200 mg (and placebo) in reducing postoperative pain. Both celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg were more effective than placebo in reducing the postoperative fentanyl requirement (74 \u00b1 67 &mgr;g and 56 \u00b1 62 &mgr;g versus 120 \u00b1 86 &mgr;g, respectively). The larger dose of celecoxib significantly reduced the percentage of patients with severe pain at discharge (6% versus 37% and 30% in the celecoxib 200 mg and control groups, respectively). The median number of doses of oral analgesic medication after discharge was also significantly reduced in the celecoxib 400 mg group (0 versus 2 and 2 in the celecoxib 200 mg and control groups, respectively). However, no differences were found among the three study groups with respect to recovery times and secondary outcome variables (e.g., patient satisfaction and quality of recovery). We conclude that oral premedication with celecoxib 400 mg was more effective than 200 mg in reducing severe postoperative pain and the need for rescue analgesic medication in the postoperative period. IMPLICATIONS: Oral premedication with celecoxib 400 mg was more effective than 200 mg in reducing postoperative pain and the need for rescue analgesic medication in the early postoperative period. However, neither dose of celecoxib was more effective than a placebo in facilitating the recovery process after outpatient surgery.", "outbound_citations": ["12357161", "11973187", "11867379", "11883386", "11878654", "11881888", "11726464", "11292426", "11759657", "11049912", "10825320", "10566562", "9027269", "9054487", "7486094", "7818104", "7978444"], "inbound_citations": ["36518729", "34938867", "30621742", "29509516", "29274661", "28164777", "26760402", "26827847"], "label": "0"}

Drugs were determined in plasma by h.p.l.c., with a chiral separation of ibuprofen and free fractions after equilibrium dialysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIntra-subject variation for COX-1 and COX-2 at baseline was at 26 +/- 18% and 18 +/- 13% respectively, and intersubject variation at 39% and 36%, respectively. The ratios of IC50s and, at best, of IC80s revealed diclofenac and meloxicam as selective COX-2 inhibitors and ibuprofen as a preferential COX-1 inhibitor in vitro. However, after oral intake, ibuprofen inhibited ex vivo COX-2 by 80% whereas diclofenac inhibited COX-1 by 70%. Meloxicam inhibited COX-1 from 30 to 55% depending on the repetition of the dose and increase in plasma concentrations. Using in vitro dose--response curves, the in vivo inhibitory potency of diclofenac was estimated adequately from its circulating concentration ([-0.18, 0.21] for COX-1 and [-0.13, -0.03] for COX-2) but this was not the case for ibuprofen on COX-2 ([-0.14, 0.27]) and meloxicam on COX-1 ([0.31, 1.05]). The limited predictability of the system was not improved through considering the unbound fraction of the drugs or the variable chiral inversion of ibuprofen.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAssessment of COX-2 selectivity based on in vitro studies and pharmacological modelling has a limited clinical relevance. There is a need to investigate COX selectivity at therapeutic plasma concentrations of NSAIDs using the ex vivo whole blood assay.", "outbound_citations": ["11087881", "10979111", "10749518", "10381787", "10377455", "10340919", "10215599", "9858421", "9808683", "19078321", "9737710", "9663182", "9696963", "9626023", "9515184", "9597150", "9444611", "9351505", "9314611", "9219313", "9084574", "9114728", "9013379", "9013378", "8656779", "8121485", "8454631", "2613835", "3933848", "686171", "5284360", "9098660", "PMC22126", "PMC1564971", "PMC1220196"], "inbound_citations": ["35093559", "34983657", "34173263", "30817844", "31017959", "30574736", "29196050", "28334796", "26899022", "26896236", "25582761", "25710756", "25759598", "25502615", "25070498"], "label": "0"}

We have evaluated the effects of single and repeated doses of nimesulide on renal haemodynamics and electrolyte excretion in 8 healthy volunteers during a prolonged course of furosemide (frusemide). Under these study conditions, renal prostaglandin synthesis is expected to be elevated, with renal function being dependent upon increased levels of prostaglandins. Nimesulide induced an acute but transient decrease in indices of renal haemodynamics. Furosemide-induced increases in plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels were blunted, and urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 was markedly reduced by nimesulide. The magnitude and time course of the natriuretic, kaliuretic and diuretic effects of furosemide were attenuated by nimesulide. Although the transient nature of the observed renal haemodynamic changes suggests that the risk of developing acute renal failure is small, the rise should be taken into account in patients with renal dysfunction. Sodium and potassium retention, and the blunting of the diuretic-induced electrolyte excretion, could be of clinical relevance.

Many agents have been proposed for the treatment of PsA, but their use is based more on clinical experience than on sound scientific evidence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe reviewed MedLine up to November 2002, searching for 'psoriatic arthritis', 'drug therapy, 'controlled trials' and 'outcomes' and all possible acronyms for these terms. All relevant papers were then examined in detail.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPsA is a condition that runs a variable clinical course. Mild forms can usually be controlled by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are indicated in patients with persistent mono- or oligoarthritis. Patients with severe and progressive articular disease not responsive to NSAIDs should be treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to prevent joint damage and disability. Currently, methotrexate and sulphasalazine are considered the DMARDs of choice, but the evidence for the use of methotrexate in PsA is still largely empirical, while the clinical benefit induced by sulphasalazine appears to be modest. Other DMARDs proposed for the treatment of PsA include cyclosporin, gold salts and, more recently, leflunomide. However, none of the DMARDs available to date are effective in the treatment of psoriatic pelvispondylitis; in addition, a number of patients with severe peripheral arthritis fail to respond to standard DMARDs. Recently, tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors have proved effective in many PsA patients with pelvispondylitis or recalcitrant peripheral synovitis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNone of the current treatments for PsA is curative, but significant clinical amelioration can be achieved in the vast majority of patients. Identification and prompt treatment of patients with severe articular disease is crucial for the achievement of a satisfactory clinical response and the improvement of the long-term outcome.", "outbound_citations": ["8088061", "12384938", "12242171", "12233885", "11990861", "12093311", "11825322", "11669169", "11592375", "11296544", "11157143", "11085795", "10955334", "10972371", "10834859", "10775866", "10759624", "11146896", "10555027", "10567972", "10450037", "10468800", "10439523", "10411377", "10378711", "10599345", "9779850", "9712099", "9627021", "9613341", "9672996", "9195517", "9159530", "9117186", "8961906", "8814063", "8670601", "8864579", "8646438", "9064105", "8763085", "8624624", "8574638", "7644624", "8575136", "7779129", "8587077", "7748217", "8587078", "7791162", "7788959", "29224451", "7738945", "7822521", "8034807", "8076399", "8149659", "8250615", "8104656", "8495258", "8457451", "1467290", "1491390", "1561405", "1353720", "1828327", "2066954", "1899330", "2124243", "2242069", "2116206", "1968355", "2645874", "3668983", "3708243", "3883917", "6712754", "509840", "357213", "4629438", "5008065", "14174051", "14118668"], "inbound_citations": ["29974970", "29963716", "28293446", "26610694", "26470797", "25603696"], "label": "0"}

Two isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, have been identified (1-4); traditional NSAIDs inhibit both isoforms (5). Cyclooxygenase-1 is constitutively expressed throughout the body and is thought to play an essential role in normal gastrointestinal and platelet function, whereas COX-2 is induced in the presence of inflammation. Inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause the adverse gastrointestinal effects associated with NSAID therapy, whereas inhibition of COX-2 has been associated with the therapeutic effects of NSAIDs (6). When administered at therapeutic doses, rofecoxib inhibits only the COX-2 isoform (7). Common renal adverse effects of traditional NSAIDs (which inhibit renal COX-1 and COX-2) are reductions in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, and sodium and potassium excretion. These effects can lead to fluid retention, edema, hypertension, and hyperkalemia. The degree to which inhibition of COX-1 compared with inhibition of COX-2 may be responsible for different NSAID-associated nephrotoxicities has not been clearly delineated. Studies in animals and humans demonstrate the constitutive presence of COX-2 in the kidney, which suggests that COX-2 may play a substantial role in renal function (8, 9). A recent study in healthy volunteers indicated a renal effect of COX-2 inhibition with celecoxib, although it was unknown whether this was a drug-specific or class effect (10). We studied a range of doses of rofecoxib, a drug that specifically inhibits COX-2, and examined clinical conditions that are known to be associated with susceptibility to adverse renal effects of NSAIDs. To determine the effects of COX-2 inhibition on glomerular filtration rate and serum and urine electrolyte balance, we administered rofecoxib to elderly patients who were receiving a sodium-restricted diet, which enhanced renal dependence on prostaglandin production (11, 12). The nonisoform-specific COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor indomethacin was included as a comparator to determine the relative clinical importance of inhibiting both COX isoforms. Methods The protocols were approved by the institutional review board at each site, and each patient provided written informed consent. Patients were nonsmokers in good general health who had a body mass index of 34 kg/m2 or less. Patients with thyroid disease; allergy to iodine; or a history of substantial cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension requiring treatment, hepatic disease, sodium-losing nephropathy, NSAID-induced renal failure, or peptic ulcer disease were excluded. Patients who received immunosuppressant therapy (including steroids) within 3 months before entry or a history of bladder outlet obstruction or urinary retention (including benign prostatic hyperplasia) within 6 months of study entry were also excluded. Concomitant use of diuretics, misoprostol, or any drug known to affect renal function, as well as low-dose aspirin or any NSAIDs, was prohibited. Randomization was done by using a computer-generated allocation schedule. Placebo was identical in appearance to the active drug, and only the person who packaged the supplies at Merck Research Laboratories was unblinded. Single-Dose Study The single-dose study had a three-period balanced crossover design. Patients 60 to 80 years of age who had creatinine clearance of at least 40 mL/min were enrolled at a single center (Indiana University). Before each study period, patients received a diet that included 43 mEq of sodium per day for 3 days; they then received a diet consisting of 30 mEq of sodium, 60 to 80 mEq of potassium, and 80 g protein for 3 more days (study days 6 to 1). If patients had a stable body weight (change 0.5 kg) on days 2 and 1, they were randomly assigned to double-blind, double-dummy treatment with single doses of rofecoxib, 250 mg; indomethacin, 75 mg; or placebo. At the time that this study was performed, clinical data demonstrating the effectiveness of rofecoxib at doses as low as 12.5 mg were not yet available. The 250-mg dose was chosen to load patients in a manner similar to that achieved with the 75-mg dose of indomethacin while maintaining COX-2 selectivity (7). The glomerular filtration rate was calculated by measuring inulin clearance before and after each treatment. Multiple-Dose Study Patients 65 to 80 years of age with creatinine clearance of 30 to 80 mL/min were enrolled at four centers (Hennepin County Medical Center and Total Renal Research, Inc.; Clinical Pharmacology Associates; PPD; and Indiana University). For 8 days (study days 8 to 1), they received a diet consisting of 30 mEq of sodium, 60 to 80 mEq of potassium, and 80 g of protein. Patients with a stable body weight (change 0.5 kg) on days 2 and 1 received a single-blind dose of placebo and underwent baseline measurement of iothalamate clearance to calculate the glomerular filtration rate. After the glomerular filtration rate was obtained, patients were randomly assigned to receive rofecoxib, 12.5 mg/d; rofecoxib, 25 mg/d; indomethacin, 50 mg three times daily; or placebo for 5 days. Assignments were made in a double-blind, double-dummy manner using a parallel-group design. Patients continued to receive a low-sodium diet. On the sixth day of drug administration (day 6), the glomerular filtration rate was calculated again after the first dose of drug or placebo was given for that day. Inulin, Iothalamate, and Creatinine Clearances Inulin was prepared and analyzed according to standard methods (13). A loading dose of 10% inulin, 0.25 mL/kg, was administered, followed by a 6-hour sustaining continuous intravenous infusion of 0.45 mL per mL/min of creatinine clearance, as determined previously. 125I-Iothalamate (4-mL vials, Cypros Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, California) was used in the multicenter study because of ease of handling. 125I-Iothalamate has been shown to be an excellent determinant of glomerular filtration rate compared with inulin (14, 15). A 30-Ci priming dose of 125I-iothalamate was administered, followed by a 6-hour sustaining continuous intravenous infusion of 120 Ci, for a total dose of 150 Ci. In both studies, patients fasted from midnight the night before until lunchtime on the day of glomerular filtration rate determination. During measurement of the glomerular filtration rate, patients remained semirecumbent except during scheduled spontaneous voids (no catheters were placed). After receiving a loading dose of inulin or iothalamate, patients drank water, 10 mL/kg, to stimulate urine flow; flow was subsequently maintained by continuous intravenous infusion of a 5% dextrose solution in a volume equal to urinary losses plus 15 mL every 30 minutes. Drug was administered after equilibration was complete (urine output of>75 mL during two consecutive 30-minute collection periods). Blood and urine specimens for measurement of inulin or iothalamate, creatinine, sodium, and potassium were obtained every 30 minutes starting at least 2 hours before drug administration (equilibration period) and until 6 hours afterward. Thereafter, samples were obtained 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours after drug administration. Body weight, urinary electrolyte balance, creatinine clearance, and vital signs (including orthostatic changes) were monitored daily. Because the pharmacokinetics of rofecoxib and indomethacin differ and peak effects would be expected to occur at different times, inulin and iothalamate clearances were measured every 30 minutes for the 6 hours after drug administration. The following formula was used: Cl=(U V)/S, where Cl is clearance, U is the urinary concentration of inulin or creatinine (or iothalamate counts), V is the urine flow rate (measured as mL/s), and S is the serum concentration of inulin or creatinine (or iothalamate counts). The minimum glomerular filtration rate was defined as the lowest mean value observed in the moving average values obtained at three consecutive 30-minute intervals after drug administration. In the single-dose study, peak reduction from baseline was defined as the maximal difference between the minimum glomerular filtration rate after drug administration and the mean glomerular filtration rate measured during urinary stabilization (baseline). For the multiple-dose study, peak reduction in glomerular filtration rate was defined as the difference between the minimum glomerular filtration rate obtained after placebo administration on day 1 and the minimum glomerular filtration rate obtained after drug administration on day 6. Urinary and Serum Sodium and Potassium Urinary sodium excretion was calculated as follows: [100 urine volume (L) urinary sodium (mmol/L)]/[difference in collection time (seconds)]; thus, the final values are expressed as 100 mmol Na/s. A similar equation was used to convert the urinary potassium volume to urinary potassium excretion values. Statistical Analysis Data were forwarded to the statistics department at Merck Research Laboratories, and analyses were based on the treatment received. In the single-dose study, an analysis of covariance model was used. Carryover effects were tested and found to be nonsignificant (P>0.2). The final model included terms for patient, period, treatment, sequence, and predose value as covariates. The final analysis of covariance model for the multiple-dose parallel-group study included factors for treatment, site, and the minimum glomerular filtration rate on day 1 (baseline). Similar analyses were used for absolute and average changes in inulin or iothalamate clearance, creatinine clearance, urinary sodium excretion, urinary potassium excretion, and serum levels of sodium and potassium. The normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions of the analysis of covariance models were tested by using the ShapiroWilk statistic and the Levene test, respectively.

This concern stemmed from observations indicating that the COX-2 isoform is the major source of endothelium-derived prostacyclin and, hence, that selective blockade of this enzyme may impair endothelial health. To investigate this matter, we examined the effects of 7 days of treatment with rofecoxib versus naproxen on endothelial function in healthy volunteers. Methods and Results\u2014Thirty-five healthy volunteers were randomized to receive 7-day treatment with either rofecoxib (25 mg/d, n=18) or naproxen (750 mg/d, n=17). Vascular response measurements were conducted using forearm strain-gauge plethysmography. Changes in forearm blood flow in response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (3, 10, and 30 &mgr;g/min) and the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (1 and 10 &mgr;g/min) were assessed before and after treatment. Acetylcholine evoked a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow in all groups. Importantly, treatment resulted in no change in acetylcholine-mediated increases in forearm blood flow in either group (naproxen, P =0.27; rofecoxib, P =0.58). Similarly, there was no change in forearm blood flow in response to sodium nitroprusside (naproxen, P =0.55; rofecoxib, P =0.63). Conclusions\u2014We herein describe, for the first time, the effects of COX-2-selective inhibition on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in healthy adults. COX-2 blockade, when used at the doses employed therapeutically (which are known to inhibit vascular prostacyclin production) did not result in significant changes in endothelial vasodilator responses in healthy volunteers. The effects of COX-2 inhibitors on vasodilator responses in patients with coronary artery disease remain to be determined.", "outbound_citations": ["11509060", "11300445", "11759657", "10952950", "10761955", "10742298", "10556220", "10215647", "10073969", "9950869", "29598605", "9874808", "9665055", "29586009", "1991363"], "inbound_citations": ["32640277", "32360620", "31493463", "31020376", "30919339", "27211886", "26455241", "26084115", "24698105"], "label": "0"}

However, blanket advice to avoid all NSAIDs is no longer reasonable. Except for AERD and chronic urticaria, cross-reactivity with other NSAIDs does not occur. A physician can definitively prove this by giving the patient another NSAID in their office and observing no reaction. Furthermore, for patients with AERD and chronic urticaria, they can be given the new selective COX-2 inhibitors (rofecoxib and celecoxib) without any cross-reactivity. All AERD patients can be desensitized to ASA and treated with ASA indefinitely. However, ASA desensitization in chronic urticaria is not possible. Underlying mild and moderate AERD responds well to topical and systemic corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers. However, the severe forms of the disease should be desensitized to ASA and treated with this drug on a long term basis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare scratch-patch and patch tests prospectively with frequently used drugs in persons exposed or not exposed to the drug in order to define a nonirritating concentration.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAltogether, 23 different drugs, mainly antibiotics and analgesics, were evaluated. Any contraindications for patch tests were excluded by a questionnaire. Sixty-one healthy individuals were tested. They were divided into two groups: Group 1 consisted of individuals who hadn't been exposed to the drug; Group 2 was comprised of individuals who had been exposed to the drug, without side effects. Each individual was tested with 10-20 scratch-patch and patch tests. The tests were performed on the upper back. Freshly prepared drug solutions were applied, on one side after scarification of the epidermis, on the other side without. Scratch-patch tests were read at 24 and 48 h, patch tests after 48 and 72 h. In addition, we included 73 individuals with a drug allergy to illustrate that the chosen drug concentrations are able to elicit a positive reaction in truly sensitized individuals.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA positive reaction in the non-exposed and nonallergic individuals was considered to be an irritant reaction (IR). In Group 1 (non-exposed individuals), 341 scratch-patch tests were performed, with 22 showing a reaction at the first reading, 3 at the second. Of the 341 patch tests performed in this group, 21 reactions were observed at the first reading, and 7 at the second. In Group 2 (exposed individuals), 141 scratch-patch tests were performed, with 5 IR at the first reading and 1 at the second. Of the 138 patch tests performed in this group, 6 individuals showed an IR at the first, 2 at the second reading. The majority of IR were four drugs, namely cefuroxim, acetylsalicylic acid, propyphenazone/drofenin-HCl, and celecoxib. Lowering the concentration did not reduce the unspecified irritant skin reaction, while a change of the solvent (petrolatum instead of PBS) did reduce the IR.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data show concentrations of 23 drugs suitable for scratch-patch or patch tests, as they do not elicit IR. Fourteen of these test preparations elicited a positive reaction in truly sensitized individuals, demonstrating that the test preparation is suitable to identify sensitized persons. Scratch-patch tests are an interesting alternative to patch tests, as they do not elicit more IR than patch tests but can be evaluated earlier. Certain drugs solved in PBS are irritant over a wide dosage range and need to be applied in petrolatum.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36313986", "31248852", "29460514", "27720768", "25895484"], "label": "0"}

Endothelial cells were analyzed for proliferation, apoptosis and cytotoxicity in response to increasing concentrations of treosulfan, either in the absence or presence of COX-2 inhibitor, to determine whether inhibition of COX-2 enhanced the effect of treosulfan on cell function. In a clinical pilot study, 12 consecutive patients with pretreated advanced melanoma, meeting the eligibility criteria were enrolled. Patients received combined daily treosulfan chemotherapy (500 mg) with rofecoxib (25 mg). Metastatic lesions were assessed every 12 weeks. Patients with responsive or stable disease were eligible for a further 12-week treatment period. Response criteria according to the WHO handbook for reporting results of cancer treatment were applied. Side effects were classified according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria v2.0. At noncytotoxic concentrations, treosulfan inhibited endothelial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. Simultaneous inhibition of COX-2 significantly increased the extent to which treosulfan suppressed cell proliferation, without inducing cytotoxicity. In the pilot study in which 12 patients were treated, toxicity was mild; only hematologic toxicity of grade II was seen. An objective response was noted in one patient, and four patients showed stabilization of their disease for 24 weeks (one) and 36 weeks (three). The patient who had a partial response subsequently showed stable disease for 48 weeks. The median survival time was 13 months. As increases in response rates following polychemo- or biochemotherapy have not been shown to correlate with prolongation in overall survival, more durable control of metastatic melanoma represents an attractive therapeutic goal. Thus, regimens scheduled to primarily target endothelial cells may potentially provide a palliative alternative that preserves quality of life in the absence of significant treatment-related toxicity.", "outbound_citations": ["12569289", "12460910", "12407508", "12228212", "11863092", "11705841", "11606386", "11181686", "11254118", "10766175", "10854136", "10772661", "10561349", "10380934", "10590059", "9625618", "9586887", "9216692", "14257946"], "inbound_citations": ["30776082", "28314176", "27270229", "26865640", "25631130", "25076256"], "label": "0"}

The drugs that were employed for therapy were diclofenac in a controlled release formulation employing the DRCM technology (subsyde-CR) and meloxicam in a standard formulation marketed in our country. Both drugs were well tolerated and found to be effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of the disease entities throughout the study period, but subsyde-CR was observed to produce a somewhat greater reduction in signs and symptoms scores that meloxicam, a difference that could be possibly attributed to the greater efficacy of subsyde-CR in non-articular rheumatic conditions. On the basis of the available literature on diclofenac and meloxicam as well as the DRCM technology in formulating subsyde-CR, it is reasonable to conclude that a controlled release formulation of diclofenac based on the DRCM technology offers a safe and effective alternative to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as meloxicam.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["25756143"], "label": "0"}

In view of the large number of patients at cardiovascular risk requiring chronic analgesic therapy with COX-2 inhibitors for arthritic and other inflammatory conditions, the effects of selective COX-2 inhibition on clinically useful surrogates for cardiovascular disease, particularly endothelial function, need to be determined. Methods and Results\u2014Fourteen male patients (mean age, 66\u00b13 years) with severe coronary artery disease (average of 2.6 vessels with stenosis >75%) undergoing stable background therapy with aspirin and statins were included. The patients received celecoxib (200 mg BID) or placebo for a duration of 2 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion. After each treatment period, flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, oxidized LDL, and prostaglandins were measured. Celecoxib significantly improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation compared with placebo (3.3\u00b10.4% versus 2.0\u00b10.5%, P =0.026), whereas endothelium-independent vasodilation, as assessed by nitroglycerin, remained unchanged (9.0\u00b11.6% versus 9.5\u00b11.3%, P =0.75). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was significantly lower after celecoxib (1.3\u00b10.4 mg/L) than after placebo (1.8\u00b10.5 mg/L, P =0.019), as was oxidized LDL (43.6\u00b12.4 versus 47.6\u00b12.6 U/L, P =0.028), whereas prostaglandins did not change. Conclusions\u2014This is the first study to demonstrate that selective COX-2 inhibition improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation and reduces low-grade chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in coronary artery disease. Thus, selective COX-2 inhibition holds the potential to beneficially impact outcome in patients with cardiovascular disease.", "outbound_citations": ["15599670", "12186793", "12105151", "12105157", "11964481", "11956125", "11835924", "11809254", "11696466", "11509060", "11238052", "11173047", "11087881", "11073878", "10979111", "10961964", "10952950", "10779454", "10704159", "10639539", "10961963", "10514410", "10375319", "10073969", "9988750", "9874808", "10223523", "9727541", "9709409", "9498533", "9241131", "8964118", "7540723", "7758192", "8040344", "8175750", "1891022", "6406508", "1005741"], "inbound_citations": ["36897491", "36467554", "35865527", "35460762", "35198242", "34769460", "34371842", "34222246", "34136907", "34509349", "33748715", "33275290", "32909857", "32265716", "31439354", "31844085", "31724835", "31715013", "31480335", "30935055", "29939099", "31168026", "30631366", "29674687", "29202670", "29020251", "29077004", "28866675", "28658301", "28344559", "28178591", "28105253", "27682709", "27317138", "27603385", "27020548", "26940257", "26444418", "26816492", "26360837", "26466383", "26341793", "26308616", "26455241", "26209052", "24517373", "25019344", "24856376"], "label": "0"}

Improvements in mental health with rofecoxib use primarily resulted from effective treatment of OA (i.e., reduction in pain and improvement in physical function).", "outbound_citations": ["10817549", "10877012", "10580458", "10555907", "10096266", "9220039", "8450681", "8105525", "1593914", "1575785", "3068365", "3668977"], "inbound_citations": ["27467204", "26882928", "26882927", "25766121", "25231685"], "label": "1"}

She had a history of mixed connective tissue disease and had been started on rofecoxib therapy 1 month prior to the onset of her skin symptoms. Discontinuation of rofecoxib was followed by resolution of symptoms within a period of 3 weeks. Similar palmar skin changes following water exposure have been reported to occur in cystic fibrosis and are thought to be due to increased salt content of the skin and secondary increased water\u2010binding capacity. Rofecoxib is a selective COX\u20102 inhibitor that has been shown to increase sodium reabsorption in the kidney via effects on prostaglandin E2 and the renal vasculature. The COX\u20102 protein is also expressed in keratinocytes and plays a role in keratinocyte differentiation. Prostaglandin E2 also plays a role in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Thus rofecoxib may cause increased sodium reabsorption in the skin, as it does in the kidney. The rofecoxib\u2010associated elevation in skin sodium may increase keratin water\u2010binding capacity and cause exaggerated aquagenic wrinkling of the skin, as occurs in cystic fibrosis.", "outbound_citations": ["10797288", "10628595", "10555907", "10566565", "10417761", "10215647", "9929039", "9665805", "8612694"], "inbound_citations": ["35796149", "36226015", "34016560", "33914973", "34272019", "33342182", "33464626", "32776375", "31365219", "29019823", "28329484", "28329534", "28329612", "27492920", "25827615", "26873568", "26994017", "26833995", "27026144", "26158367", "25549815", "25683007", "25681031", "24982711"], "label": "0"}

Aims: To estimate whether meloxicam and the coxibs, rofecoxib and celecoxib, have been channelled towards high risk patients, and to estimate the risk of hospitalisation for gastrointestinal haemorrhage associated with the use of these drugs, allowing for the effects of channelling. Patients: Using the UK General Practice Research Database, this study included 7.1 thousand patient years (tpy) exposure to meloxicam, 1.6 tpy exposure to coxibs, and 628 tpy exposure to older non-specific NSAIDs. Methods: Cohort study of patients who received a prescription for an NSAID between June 1987 and January 2001. Exposure to newer NSAIDs (meloxicam, rofecoxib, celecoxib) and to older non-specific NSAIDs was identified. Channelling was assessed on factors including: demographic variables; diagnosis of arthritis; history of NSAID use or gastrointestinal events, including gastrointestinal haemorrhage; and use of ulcer healing drugs. Results: Most risk factors for gastrointestinal haemorrhage were more prevalent among patients prescribed the newer NSAIDs. Adjusting for these risk factors reduced the relative risks of gastrointestinal haemorrhage on meloxicam and coxibs versus older non-specific NSAIDs to 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.60, 1.17) and 0.36 (0.14, 0.97), respectively. Conclusions: Channelling towards high risk gastrointestinal patients occurred in the prescribing of newer NSAIDs. After attempting to correct for channelling bias, coxib exposure, but not meloxicam exposure, was associated with a significantly lower risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage than older non-specific NSAID exposure.", "outbound_citations": ["12242171", "12242172", "11892706", "11087881", "11041909", "10979111", "10955327", "10886116", "10925968", "19025810", "11041902", "10580458", "9839761", "9643612", "9402773", "8401129", "1792461", "2021768", "PMC2014964", "PMC1873548", "PMC1669537", "PMC2127829", "PMC126301", "PMC126302", "PMC1678870"], "inbound_citations": ["36864331", "35460083", "34114215", "30484960", "30136244", "29685700", "27889951", "28176886", "27312830"], "label": "1"}

Instillation of 20% ethanol (1 ml, p.o.) effectively protected against gastric mucosal injury induced by subsequent instillation of 70% or 96% ethanol (1 ml, p.o.). 3. Oral administration of indomethacin (1.25-20 mg kg[-1]) dose-dependently counteracted the protective effect of 20% ethanol (ID50: 3.5 mg kg[-1]). 4. Likewise, NS-398 (0.1-1 mg kg[-1]), L-745,337 (0.2-2 mg kg[-1]) and DFU (0.02-0.2 mg kg[-1]) inhibited the protective effect of 20% ethanol in a dose-dependent manner with ID50 values of 0.3 mg kg(-1), 0.4 mg kg(-1) and 0.06 mg kg(-1), respectively. 5. Inhibition of mild irritant-induced protection was also found when NS-398 (1 mg kg[-1]) was administered s.c. or when 96% ethanol was used to damage the mucosa. 6. Pretreatment with 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin (PG)E2 at 4 ng kg(-1), a dose that did not protect against ethanol (70%)-induced mucosal damage when given alone, completely reversed the effect of the selective COX-2 inhibitors on the mild irritant-induced protection. 7. Pretreatment with dexamethasone (3 mg kg(-1), 24 and 2 h before instillation of 20% ethanol) did not affect the protective activity of the mild irritant, indicating that enzyme induction is not involved. 8. Indomethacin (20 mg kg(-1), p.o.) did not prevent the protection conferred by sodium salicylate (100 mg kg[-1]), dimercaprol (30 microg kg[-1]), iodoacetamide (50 mg kg[-1]) and lithium (20 mg kg[-1]). Likewise, the protective effect of these agents was not counteracted by NS-398 (1 mg kg(-1), p.o.). 9. Whereas indomethacin (20 mg kg(-1), p.o.) near-maximally inhibited gastric mucosal formation of PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1alpha and thromboxane (TX) B2 as well as platelet TXB2 release, the selective COX-2 inhibitors were ineffective. 10. The findings show that selective COX-2 inhibitors, although lacking in ulcerogenic activity, prevent the protection conferred by a mild irritant. Prostaglandis generated by a constitutive COX-2 could thus contribute to physiological functions involved in gastric homeostasis, although at present a non-COX-2-related mechanism underlying the effect of the selective COX-2 inhibitors tested on mild irritant-induced protection cannot be completely excluded.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["28946145", "28571535"], "label": "0"}

Methods and Results\u2014In an open-label, randomized, prospective, single-blind pilot study, patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation were randomized to aspirin and heparin treatment (n=60) or aspirin, heparin, and meloxicam (n=60) during coronary care unit stay. Patients then received aspirin or aspirin plus meloxicam for 30 days. During the coronary care unit stay, the primary outcomes variable of recurrent angina, myocardial infarction, or death was significantly lower in the patients receiving meloxicam (15.0% versus 38.3%, P =0.007). The second composite variable (coronary revascularization procedures, myocardial infarction, and death) was also significantly lower in meloxicam-treated patients (10.0% versus 26.7%, P =0.034). At 90 days, the primary end point remained significantly lower in the meloxicam group (21.7% versus 48.3%, P =0.004), as did the secondary end point (13.3% versus 33.3%, P =0.015) and the need for revascularization alone (11.7% versus 30.0%, P =0.025).

In this investigation, we determined the influence of parecoxib on the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, in volunteers.

The responsible COX-isoenzyme in man is unknown. Therefore, we assessed the effects of meloxicam, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, and indomethacin, an unselective inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2, on furosemide stimulated plasma renin activity (PRA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a randomized cross-over design 15 healthy female volunteers received no NSAID or meloxicam 7.5 mg/d for 6 days or indomethacin 25 mg tid for 2 days and 25 mg on the 3rd day. On the control day and on the last day of each treatment the following parameters were evaluated before and after furosemide 20 mg i.v.: PRA measured by RIA, urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) assessed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, urine volume and urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, and creatinine, and serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, and creatinine.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFurosemide led to a more than two-fold rise of PRA. Indomethacin as well as meloxicam had no significant effect on basal PRA but inhibited the furosemide-stimulated PRA increase. PGE2 excretion on the control day rose two-fold after furosemide. Meloxicam had no effect on basal PGE2 excretion, whereas indomethacin reduced this parameter by 30%. Both drugs inhibited the increase of urinary PGE2 after furosemide. No drug effects on urine flow nor on electrolytes and creatinine in serum and urine could be observed.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMeloxicam inhibited furosemide stimulated renin release, suggesting that in man COX-2 is responsible for prostaglandin synthesis mediating renin release.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["26626478"], "label": "0"}

After dental surgery, 151 patients (50.3% women; mean age, 18.3 years; 93.4% white) experiencing moderate-to-severe pain were to receive a single dose of placebo, rofecoxib 50 mg, or ibuprofen 400 mg.

Tolerability was assessed using spontaneous reports of adverse experiences, physical findings, and laboratory measurements. The results of this study demonstrated that rofecoxib 50 mg was more effective than placebo on all measures of analgesic efficacy. Rofecoxib 50 mg exhibited overall analgesic effects, onset of analgesia, and peak analgesic effects that were not significantly different from those of ibuprofen 400 mg, with a significantly longer duration of action (P < 0.05).

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of celecoxib compared with placebo on 24-hour BP levels in ACE inhibitor-treated patients with hypertension. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial involving 178 men and women (mean age, 53 years) with essential hypertension who were treated and controlled with lisinopril monotherapy (10 to 40 mg daily). Baseline BP values were obtained using 24-hour ambulatory recordings. Patients received either celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily (twice the recommended dose for osteoarthritis) (n=91), or placebo (n=87) for 4 weeks, and changes in the 24-hour BP, body weight, and clinical laboratory parameters were assessed. Mean changes from baseline in the 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP were 2.6/1.5\u00b10.9/0.6 mm Hg on celecoxib versus 1.0/0.3\u00b11/0.6 mm Hg on placebo (P =0.34 for systolic BP;P =0.45 for diastolic BP). The proportion of patients whose 24-hour BP increased by at least 5, 10, 15, or 20 mm Hg were also similar on celecoxib and placebo. No changes in body weight, serum creatinine, or potassium occurred in either group. Thus, these data demonstrate that high doses of celecoxib have no significant effect on the antihypertensive effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The placebo-subtracted changes observed in 24-hour BP (1.6/1.2 mm Hg) are less than what has been reported for nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in ACE inhibitor-treated patients.", "outbound_citations": ["11304662", "11087881", "10979111", "10988282", "10789664", "10509552", "9758314", "9751091", "9461245", "9465844", "9135032", "9211170", "7755942", "7995639", "8037411", "8435027", "1953813", "2521522"], "inbound_citations": ["35704141", "34376069", "33689795", "32322101", "31809346", "31527829", "31480335", "30144099", "30372885", "30354828", "29505772", "29392089", "29020251", "27977473", "28263539", "26351780", "26288292"], "label": "0"}

H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) are less effective for this task, but are widely used by patients and physicians for the treatment of GI symptoms and duodenal ulcers. Sucralfate is a weaker agent that is sometimes used for prophylaxis or treatment of upper GI ulcers. We investigated the effect of GI drugs and selective and nonselective NSAID on the incidence of GI ulcer development in a cohort of patients immediately after the release of celecoxib and rofecoxib to investigate the effect of confounding by indication when effective GI agents and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors are prescribed to a high risk population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nDuring a 6 month period of observation 8547 NSAID users were evaluated by mailed questionnaire concerning NSAID drug use and ulcer development. In the first half of 1999, patients took 12,177 separate NSAID courses. GI therapy that followed the development of upper GI ulcers was excluded from analysis. Ulcer reports were confirmed by followup validation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGI drugs were used concomitantly in this population by 42% of patients using an NSAID. GI drugs were associated with an increased risk of ulcer. But this risk was confined to PPI (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.95, 5.69), and not to other GI drugs. Overall, patients using nonselective NSAID compared to those taking COX-2-specific inhibitors had an increased risk of upper GI ulcers (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.43, 3.34). Patients taking nonselective NSAID plus PPI were also at increased risk for upper GI ulcers compared to those taking nonselective NSAID alone (OR 5.09. 95% CI 3.88, 6.67). Similarly, the risk of upper GI ulcers was increased in the nonselective NSAID plus PPI group (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.32, 6.31) compared to the COX-2 plus PPI group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPPI use, but not other GI drug use, is a marker for increased susceptibility to ulcers among NSAID users. This risk of upper GI ulcers is increased in PPI users regardless of which NSAID is used (nonselective or COX-2-specific inhibitor). Although COX-2 use is associated with greater risk factors for upper GI ulcers due to channeling bias, COX-2 users have significantly fewer ulcers than equivalent nonselective NSAID users regardless of concomitant PPI utilization.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31967089", "31562745", "30263093", "26726119"], "label": "0"}

No difference was observed regarding number of swollen joints. The difference between meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily and placebo reached statistical significance in 2 of the 4 primary endpoints, disease activity assessed by the patient and number of tender/painful joints. A statistically significant difference between meloxicam 1.5 mg and 7.5 mg was not observed for any primary endpoint. The rating of global tolerance by investigators and patients at the end of the study was similar in the 3 treatment groups, indicating that meloxicam and placebo were generally similarly well tolerated. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances reported by patients receiving meloxicam 15 mg.

In an initial control cycle, serial hormonal analyses, detection of a measurable mid-cycle urine LH peak and transvaginal ultrasound scans were performed to confirm normal ovulatory and endocrinological cyclic patterns, in all participating women. During the subsequent treatment cycle, serial ultrasound scans were performed. When the dominant follicle reached 14-16 mm in diameter, 25 mg rofecoxib or placebo was taken orally, once daily for 9 consecutive days, during which follicle size was monitored daily by ultrasound scans and serial hormone analyses were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFour of the six women who received rofecoxib demonstrated delayed follicle rupture, >48 h after the LH peak, when compared with the placebo group, who all had follicular rupture >36 h after the detected LH peak.

Stable use of cholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen, low-dose aspirin, and vitamin E was allowed. Participants with inflammatory diseases that might respond to the study medications were excluded. Of 474 participants screened, 351 were enrolled.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nOnce-daily rofecoxib, 25 mg, or twice-daily naproxen sodium, 220 mg, or placebo.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome measure was the 1-year change in the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) subscale score. Secondary outcome measures included the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum-of-boxes, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Quality of Life-AD, and the time to attainment of significant end points (4-point decline from baseline ADAS-Cog score, 1-step worsening on the global Clinical Dementia Rating scale, 15-point decline on the ADCS activities of daily living inventory, institutionalization, or death).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 1-year mean (SD) change in ADAS-Cog scores in participants treated with naproxen (5.8 [8.0]) or rofecoxib (7.6 [7.7]) was not significantly different from the change in participants treated with placebo (5.7 [8.2]). Results of secondary analyses showed no consistent benefit of either treatment. Fatigue, dizziness, and hypertension were more commonly reported in the active drug groups, and more serious adverse events were found in the active treatment group than in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of this study indicate that rofecoxib or low-dose naproxen does not slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.", "outbound_citations": ["12050157", "11959394", "11700559", "11754986", "11755007", "11588192", "11513909", "11255454", "11061280", "10908610", "10874062", "10858586", "10680787", "10408559", "9740394", "9153155", "9065537", "9236950", "8757015", "7824134", "8232972", "8351023", "3719049", "6496779", "6610841", "6860082"], "inbound_citations": ["37277738", "36732846", "36830872", "36875711", "36494656", "37118290", "36232867", "36012569", "35913583", "35870032", "35890126", "35635864", "35439840", "35293018", "35286658", "36396272", "34842189", "34769106", "34733174", "34532569", "34508923", "34387831", "34205235", "34083109", "34071270", "33967682", "33854189", "33921556", "33814447", "33503465", "34934803", "33245277", "33239064", "33324164", "33268621", "33015377", "32903806", "32696348", "32557792", "32647537", "32471239", "32473177", "32380758", "32370224", "32353686", "32277473", "32296418", "32096857", "32056347", "31904232", "32435687", "31703966", "31669590", "31839609", "31429696", "31744005", "31680933", "31564456", "31556017", "31405825", "30472151", "31476157", "31213669", "30987893", "31211178", "30702751", "31038371", "31312547", "30641141", "30952794", "30897353", "30557266", "30691318", "30394348", "30187490", "30020833", "31699314", "30714956", "30612155", "30513991", "30646339", "30198872", "30386819", "30005856", "30097809", "30065258", "29758942", "29896105", "29796737", "29780321", "29226424", "29669408", "29306052", "29385735", "29377514", "26787096", "28341179", "26385017", "29226863", "29376849", "29405227", "29370871", "29153601", "29359063", "29260466", "29245902", "28928652", "28848420", "28671413", "28620147", "28578785", "28625273", "28757769", "27544872", "28212683", "27989667", "27293026", "27872687", "28671119", "27872486", "28344933", "27667770", "27778163", "27404378", "27248001", "27531201", "28721267", "27312378", "27179961", "27240327", "26917500", "26519903", "26979823", "26079710", "26602086", "26509334", "29067290", "26967219", "26524404", "26671410", "26711460", "26177125", "26425394", "25286385", "26289122", "26244059", "25936785", "26270870", "28413375", "25772215", "26866015", "25991443", "25697476", "25511390", "25792098", "27695707", "25681452", "25024454", "25716012", "25644018", "26425394", "25589719", "25550228", "10693452", "25108596", "25246044", "25278166", "25345896", "25493089", "25230232", "24992196", "25005532", "25452117", "25019142", "24928144", "25120476", "24279689"], "label": "0"}

J. Pharmacol. 126 (1999) 1824.]. Here, we have extended these studies to humans. Healthy male volunteers were given orally one of the following drugs (mg) for 5 days: etodolac (200 or 400 b.i.d.), meloxicam (7.5 or 15 q.d.), nimesulide (100 or 200 b.i.d.), nabumetone (500 or 1000 b.i.d.) or naproxen (500 b.i.d.). Blood samples were withdrawn from the volunteers before and up to 24 h after the last dose. Plasma obtained from the blood was tested for its ability to inhibit prostanoid formation in interleukin-1beta-treated A549 cells (cyclooxygenase-2 system) and human washed platelets (cyclooxygenase-1 system). Plasma from etodolac-treated subjects demonstrated a slight selectivity towards the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2. This effect was more prominent in plasma from subjects receiving meloxicam or nimesulide. Plasma from nabumetone-treated subjects showed no or little selectivity towards cyclooxygenase-1 depending on the dose of drug administered, while plasma taken from subjects receiving naproxen was more active at inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 than cyclooxygenase-2. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that this assay can be used to assess ex vivo the relative activity against cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 of NSAIDs consumed by human volunteers. It is to be hoped that data from such systems will aid in our understanding of the relationships between the differential inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 by NSAIDs and their reported efficacies and (gastrointestinal) toxicities.", "outbound_citations": ["11028250", "10692616", "10628592", "10628588", "10628591", "10628590", "10628593", "10578123", "10546927", "10381787", "10377455", "10369403", "10372826", "10092958", "9855175", "9812177", "9435990", "9146764", "9113437", "7996488", "7858842", "8038703", "8265610", "8362824", "3933848"], "inbound_citations": ["36820091", "26271463"], "label": "0"}

Effects of NS-398 on activities of these two distinct forms of COX were investigated. COX-1 purified from ram seminal vesicles and COX-2 isolated from sheep placenta (purity was 70%) were used. The COX-1 activity was completely unaffected by 10(-4) M NS-398, whereas the COX-2 activity was concentration-dependently inhibited, the IC50 value being 3.8 x 10(-6) M.

Design: Systematic review of randomised trials that compared at least 12 weeks' celecoxib treatment with another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or placebo and reported efficacy, tolerability, or safety. Trials identified from manufacturer and by searching electronic databases and evaluated according to predefined inclusion and quality criteria. Data combined through meta-analysis. Participants: 15 187 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Main outcome measures: Efficacy: Western Ontario and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index; American College of Rheumatology responder index and joint scores for rheumatoid arthritis. Tolerability: withdrawal rates for adverse effects. Gastrointestinal safety: incidence of ulcers, bleeds, perforations, and obstructions. Results: Nine randomised controlled trials were included. Celecoxib and NSAIDS were equally effective for all efficacy outcomes. Compared with those taking other NSAIDs, in patients taking celecoxib the rate of withdrawals due to adverse gastrointestinal events was 46% lower (95% confidence interval 29% to 58%; NNT 35 at three months), the incidence of ulcers detectable by endoscopy was 71% lower (59% to 79%; NNT 6 at three months), and the incidence of symptoms of ulcers, perforations, bleeds, and obstructions was 39% lower (4% to 61%; NNT 208 at six months). Subgroup analysis of patients taking aspirin showed that the incidence of ulcers detected by endoscopy was reduced by 51% (14% to 72%) in those given celecoxib compared with other NSAIDs. The reduction was greater (73%, 52% to 84%) in those not taking aspirin. Conclusion: Celecoxib is as effective as other NSAIDs for relief of symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and has significantly improved gastrointestinal safety and tolerability.", "outbound_citations": ["12039807", "11498480", "11196544", "11087881", "10979111", "14635284", "10692616", "10609815", "10580457", "10555933", "10560596", "9146764", "2106956", "PMC1661907", "0", "PMC1120924", "PMC1123260"], "inbound_citations": ["33608251", "36514244", "35443981", "35288390", "33672354", "33262590", "33199955", "32771085", "32419073", "31937550", "31921815", "30853212", "31199288", "30621471", "30886982", "30263093", "30158472", "29481917", "29670383", "29266879", "29467586", "28530031", "28535566", "28370857", "28222627", "27877048", "27752829", "27590884", "27609846", "26983451", "26564576", "26956920", "26893514", "26292179", "26012738", "25987239", "25879879", "25857826", "25369996", "25516006", "25553105", "25516774", "25395588", "25608693", "25181002", "24788818", "25009708"], "label": "0"}

AIMS To assess the potential for rofecoxib to affect the intestine adversely, in comparison with placebo and indomethacin. SUBJECTS Thirty nine healthy subjects (aged 24\u201330 years). METHOD We performed a four period crossover trial to assess intestinal permeability before and after seven days of treatment. Permeability was measured by the urinary ratio of chromium-51 labelled ethylene diamine tetraacetate (51CrEDTA)/l-rhamnose (five hour collection). RESULTS Indomethacin 50 mg three times daily produced greater increases in intestinal permeability compared with placebo or rofecoxib (25 or 50 mg) (p\u2a7d0.001); rofecoxib was not significantly different from placebo. Mean day 7 to baseline ratios (95% confidence intervals) for51CrEDTA/l-rhamnose were 0.97 (0.82, 1.16), 0.80 (0.68, 0.95), 0.98 (0.82, 1.17), and 1.53 (1.27, 1.85) for placebo, rofecoxib 25 mg, rofecoxib 50 mg, and indomethacin groups, respectively. Rofecoxib was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION In this study, treatment for one week with indomethacin 50 mg three times daily significantly increased intestinal permeability compared with placebo, while treatment with rofecoxib 25 mg or 50 mg daily did not. The absence of a significant effect of rofecoxib on intestinal permeability at doses at least twice those recommended to treat osteoarthritis was consistent with other studies that have demonstrated little or no injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa associated with rofecoxib therapy.", "outbound_citations": ["10411562", "10381932", "10377455", "10383505", "10096266", "9824578", "9558445", "8961904", "7729650", "7610343", "7939400", "8265610", "8500743", "8454631", "1901563", "2510288", "3345876", "2888943", "3609658", "3324305", "3466837", "3085760", "6150232", "637512", "5316114", "5547573", "2493366"], "inbound_citations": ["36613372", "36080365", "34258791", "31270586", "31111054", "30730969", "30139288", "29912563", "29221664", "30315290", "27409158", "26469560", "25745343", "25434661"], "label": "0"}

LPS caused also dose-dependent elevations in urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor 6-keto PGF(1alpha) (PGI-M) and 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) (Tx-M). Platelet COX-1 inhibition by chronic administration of low-dose aspirin before LPS did not alter the symptomatic and febrile responses to LPS, but the increment in urinary PGI-M and Tx-M were both partially depressed. Pretreatment with ibuprofen, a nonspecific COX inhibitor, attenuated the febrile and systemic response to LPS and inhibited prostanoid biosynthesis. Both celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, and ibuprofen attenuated the pyrexial, but not the chronotropic, response to LPS. Experimental endotoxemia caused differential expression of the COX isozymes in monocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes ex vivo. LPS also increased urinary iPF(2alpha)-III, iPF(2alpha)-VI, and 8,12-iso-iPF(2alpha)-VI, isoprostane (iP) indices of lipid peroxidation, and none of the drugs blunted this response. These studies indicate that (a) although COX-2 predominates, both COX isozymes are induced and contribute to the prostaglandin response to LPS in humans; (b) COX activation contributes undetectably to lipid peroxidation induced by LPS; and (c) COX-2, but not COX-1, contributes to the constitutional response to LPS in humans.", "outbound_citations": ["10580457", "10580458", "10557329", "10514410", "10455102", "10215647", "10196138", "10030831", "9927504", "9874808", "9792628", "9751056", "9751057", "9737710", "9570560", "9399978", "9262402", "9933251", "9057644", "8969167", "8816815", "8964113", "8621535", "8521478", "8521477", "7615527", "7825834", "7701344", "7621402", "7857975", "7857974", "7732840", "7991575", "7943269", "7932188", "8018656", "8145785", "8159730", "8017762", "8132748", "8282809", "8226870", "8366003", "8473346", "8330905", "8449903", "1382414", "1400057", "1324603", "1634505", "1952438", "1869846", "1907252", "1849272", "2120289", "2402637", "1698311", "1694171", "2137152", "2124934", "2513144", "2667476", "3293469", "2893597", "3422430", "3686481", "3297389", "3531859", "2938849", "3882264", "6231483", "6342834", "388439", "388134", "PMC51304", "PMC45366", "PMC43549", "PMC296874", "9070471", "PMC15129", "PMC279536", "PMC407895", "PMC19856", "9520386", "7730359", "PMC23956", "PMC411572", "PMC293791", "PMC172859", "PMC1357836", "PMC1867039", "PMC294048", "PMC38399", "9184579"], "inbound_citations": ["37238029", "35883831", "34961132", "35333905", "34162145", "33450863", "33429118", "32909857", "33856731", "32274846", "32894506", "31854058", "31785598", "31774594", "30855181", "30273676", "30398845", "30393163", "30245627", "29582642", "28710775", "28692111", "28218280", "27778263", "27887033", "27841364", "27837747", "27288489", "26893119", "26123634", "26067486", "25967073", "25643632", "25662537"], "label": "0"}

Prostaglandins are lipid signaling mediators that play a central role in a broad range of diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, including inflammation, reproduction, nocioception, and gastrointestinal protection. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity is the mechanism by which nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) exert their analgesic, antipyretic, antiinflammatory, and antithrombotic effects. COX is currently believed to exist in three isoforms. In this review, we provide a concise state-of-the-art description of the role of COX in pharmacology and toxicology of skin including its involvement in normal physiology, cutaneous inflammation, nociception, wound healing, and tumorigenesis. COX-dependent pathways influence keratinocyte differentiation, hair follicle development, and hair growth. The critical role of COX-2 in pathophysiology of skin is also addressed. COX-2 mediates inflammatory processes in skin, including inflammatory hyperalgesia and nociception, and administration of specific COX-2 inhibitors reduces edema, vascular permeability, and other markers of cutaneous inflammation. A number of studies in animal models and in humans show that COX-2 inhibitors possess cancer chemopreventive properties. Selective COX-2 inhibitors have a more favorable side-effect profile. Topical formulations of COX-2 inhibitors are being developed as a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of COX-2 mediated skin diseases.", "outbound_citations": ["1417068", "12713596", "12771037", "12600754", "12604670", "12588370", "12538661", "12581424", "12466123", "12445211", "12429810", "12391014", "12242095", "12242329", "12221288", "12115530", "12126310", "12066194", "12118094", "12067981", "12056966", "12138405", "12056955", "11980643", "11953864", "11929821", "11918652", "11867967", "11793368", "11805144", "11785955", "12086405", "12201673", "12086404", "11782353", "11725205", "11751431", "11439356", "11381142", "11409492", "11259631", "11181406", "11162632", "11687951", "11196178", "11115165", "11138532", "11074830", "11053041", "11060900", "10874062", "10797288", "10828079", "10751330", "10683192", "10569809", "10553835", "10537280", "10504298", "10556918", "10506108", "10449199", "10417761", "10438452", "10449029", "10354065", "10410383", "10223206", "10023016", "9973210", "9927099", "9864404", "9885412", "9766436", "9719494", "9635856", "9558081", "9531979", "9443418", "9346237", "9349634", "9284101", "8989914", "8973605", "8945508", "8612694", "8620442", "8666058", "8967954", "7477380", "8521479", "8521477", "7561154", "7926468", "8040603", "8006426", "8259375", "7690750", "8473346", "1502263", "1597912", "1784638", "1860173", "2480117", "2912593", "2537491", "2717671", "2831188"], "inbound_citations": ["37047256", "36769042", "36770998", "36302616", "34557056", "34424423", "34295210", "33057072", "31670253", "31084723", "30604520", "29714143", "30671361", "30318397", "30360946", "29879588", "30186383", "29916051", "29254071", "29240586", "30186383", "28834104", "28693553", "30475521", "27520485", "27363505", "27189522", "27091651", "27275853", "26853699", "26280673", "26774035", "25622553", "25586195", "25834352", "25169110", "24517373", "25370008", "25127551"], "label": "0"}

Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that this loss of viability was attributable to the induction of apoptosis. Significantly, concentrations of the drug <10 microM had no effect on cell viability in vitro. The cytotoxic effects of high-dose celecoxib were independent of COX-2 inhibition because similar effects were observed in cox-2 (+/+), cox-2 (+/-) and cox-2 (-/-) fibroblasts. A plasma concentration of 2.3+/-0.7 microM was achieved when celecoxib (1250 mg/kg of chow) was fed to animals ad libitum. Despite a lack of toxicity at 2-3 microM celecoxib in vitro, there was attenuation of HCA-7 xenograft growth in vivo. Celecoxib had no effect on apoptosis, cell division, or the epithelial architecture of the normal gut in treated mice.

Patients were evaluated with standard measures of efficacy 2 to 7 days after discontinuing previous NSAID or analgesic therapy and after 2, 6, and 12 weeks of treatment with the study drug.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCelecoxib treatment led to significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis as determined by all efficacy measures. Significant pain relief occurred within 2 days of the initiation of treatment, and maximum anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity, evident within 2 weeks, was sustained throughout the 12-week study. All celecoxib doses were efficacious compared with placebo, although the 50-mg twice-daily dosage regimen was minimally effective. The higher doses of celecoxib (100 and 200 mg twice a day) were similarly efficacious, and the magnitude of improvement observed with these dosing regimens was comparable to that seen with naproxen at a dose of 500 mg twice a day. All doses of celecoxib and naproxen were well tolerated.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCOX-2 inhibition with celecoxib is an effective approach for the treatment of osteoarthritis, as seen by clinical improvement in signs and symptoms comparable to treatment with naproxen.", "outbound_citations": ["10609815", "10580457", "9751091", "9618405", "9433877", "9399978", "9249646", "9135032", "9077531", "9175123", "8694659", "8690211", "8647962", "8781269", "7500539", "7488273", "7611589", "7791168", "7832763", "7991575", "7965814", "8159730", "8132748", "8113389", "8365485", "1569057", "2052056", "1849272", "2120205", "2643434", "2653395", "3068365", "3479839", "3741515", "6529875", "6646795", "7008713", "18150288"], "inbound_citations": ["33333716", "32576210", "30908885", "31628940", "31728369", "31339385", "31073922", "30706801", "31034380", "29843006", "30057048", "29922745", "29481917", "29205898", "28921415", "28699578", "28530031", "28222627", "27809891", "27196460", "27069504", "27247722", "27330526", "26525846", "26882928", "26882927", "25589511", "26768273", "26448006", "26215539", "26014481", "26012738", "25838310", "25048053", "25270186", "25440377", "25079141", "24876792"], "label": "1"}

Scaling and root planing were performed on day 3 of drug intake. The MMP-8 levels in GCF samples obtained before and on day 10 of drug intake were determined by using the immunofluorescence assay. Plaque index (PI), papilla bleeding index (PBI), and GCF MMP-8 levels were compared within each patient group, between the 2 patient groups, and also with a clinically healthy control group using non-parametric statistical analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth meloxicam and placebo groups showed statistically significant reductions in PBI, PI, and GCF MMP-8 levels on day 10 compared to baseline (P<0.01). The GCF MMP-8 level on day 10 in the meloxicam group was similar to the clinically healthy control group (P>0.05), while it was significantly higher in the placebo group (P<0.01). Positive correlations were found between MMP-8 total amounts and PBI scores at baseline and day 10 of drug intake in the patient groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMeloxicam showed a tendency to reduce GCF MMP-8 levels in vivo within the first 10 days when used as an adjunct in the initial phase of periodontal treatment that consists of scaling and root planing. Verification of this effect on collagenase-2 downregulation, as well as on the clinical periodontal parameters in long-term studies using larger test and control groups, is needed to provide further support for the adjunctive use of selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.", "outbound_citations": ["11400151", "11400153", "11201047", "11276869", "10914805", "10847542", "11413609", "10589813", "10415725", "10415802", "10445359", "9831328", "9395486", "9297576", "8870111", "8631924", "8630636", "8630638", "8849843", "8569187", "7775665", "8537867", "7722844", "7923879", "8121485", "8227450", "8265204", "29539681", "8435466", "1404131", "1849272", "2002431", "2851042", "2975331", "2841442", "3025403", "3534004", "3463028", "3856574", "3888158", "6232362", "6348520", "7033302", "14158464"], "inbound_citations": ["35270821", "33513808", "32089643", "27127039", "26321824", "25166440", "24799321"], "label": "0"}

Design: Meta-analysis of 24 randomised controlled trials (almost 66 000 participants). Intervention: Aspirin compared with placebo or no treatment, for a minimum of one year. Main outcome measures: Incidence of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Results: Gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred in 2.47% of patients taking aspirin compared with 1.42% taking placebo (odds ratio 1.68; 95% confidence interval 1.51 to 1.88); the number needed to harm was 106 (82 to 140) based on an average of 28 months' therapy. At doses below 163 mg/day, gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred in 2.30% of patients taking aspirin compared with 1.45% taking placebo (1.59; 1.40 to 1.81). Meta-regression showed no relation between gastrointestinal haemorrhage and dose. For modified release formulations of aspirin the odds ratio was 1.93 (1.15 to 3.23). Conclusions: Long term therapy with aspirin is associated with a significant increase in the incidence of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. No evidence exists that reducing the dose or using modified release formulations would reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.", "outbound_citations": ["10692616", "10489318", "10023923", "8937281", "7663258", "7711618", "8581752", "8298418", "8471398", "1922220", "2389755", "2868172", "PMC1381566", "PMC2550668", "PMC2539220", "PMC2549215"], "inbound_citations": ["37163267", "36964623", "37103016", "36510400", "36342475", "36335890", "36292053", "35908971", "35570250", "35411788", "35442342", "35128982", "35388113", "35057084", "35055393", "34775204", "34539583", "34340993", "34101229", "34208432", "34266464", "33936713", "33681329", "33479775", "33340443", "33176506", "33073362", "32886529", "32831830", "32418105", "32384548", "32299908", "32294786", "32725974", "32216763", "32163816", "32231413", "31520444", "31816436", "31679516", "31198930", "30681185", "31316561", "31159806", "30999962", "30719065", "31470783", "30367848", "30479459", "30410398", "29159948", "30828557", "29948304", "29976280", "29634579", "30487673", "29718891", "29599304", "29413372", "30158070", "28722184", "29066481", "28754388", "28363584", "28387542", "28395507", "28396798", "28507597", "28293429", "27086572", "28145783", "27937054", "27886815", "27628008", "27981489", "27824864", "27807847", "27882086", "27548406", "27490468", "27002280", "26067033", "27258581", "27161407", "27012778", "26239393", "26942907", "26879862", "26868177", "26789391", "27783266", "26595684", "26554558", "26203254", "26142028", "25912126", "26131815", "25995130", "25863302", "25828331", "25800393", "25495855", "25252119", "25541030", "25595209", "25846476", "25521733", "24946110", "25360605", "25100080", "24830902", "26413491", "24880912", "24677636", "24820203"], "label": "0"}

To suppress the pain and the inflammatory process, patients are often chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) users. Chronic use of NSAIDs may induce peptic ulcer, dyspeptic problems and heartburn. Therefore, these patients are often provided with treatment to relieve and/or protect against gastrointestinal problems. Rheumatic disorders also affect a range of health-related quality of life domains. In one study, patients with NSAID-associated gastroduodenal lesions complained about lack of energy, sleep disturbances, emotional distress and social isolation in addition to pain and mobility limitations. The degree of distress and dysfunction differed markedly from scores in an unselected population. Clinical trial data suggest that acid-suppressing therapy with omeprazole is superior to therapy with misoprostol and ranitidine in healing gastroduodenal lesions and preventing abdominal pain, heartburn and indigestion symptoms during continued NSAID treatment. Because arthritic patients are severely incapacitated by their condition regarding most aspects of health-related quality of life, it is important to offer a treatment that is effective in healing and preventing NSAID-induced ulcers and gastrointestinal symptoms during continued NSAID treatment without further compromising the patients' quality of life. Treatment with omeprazole once daily has been shown to be superior to that with ranitidine and misoprostol in this respect.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

We compared the rates of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among elderly patients dispensed selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, naproxen, and nonselective nonnaproxen nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative health care data from Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 1998, to March 31, 2001. We identified NSAID-naive cohorts of subjects aged 66 years and older in whom treatment was initiated with celecoxib (n = 15 271), rofecoxib (n = 12 156), naproxen (n = 5669), and nonnaproxen nonselective NSAIDs (n = 33 868), along with a randomly selected control cohort not exposed to NSAIDs (n = 100 000). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare AMI rates between study drug groups while controlling for potential confounders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRelative to control subjects, the multivariate model showed no significant differences in AMI risk for new users of celecoxib (adjusted rate ratio [aRR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.2), rofecoxib (aRR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.4), naproxen (aRR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.7), or nonnaproxen nonselective NSAIDs (aRR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.4).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings of this observational study suggest no increase in the short-term risk of AMI among users of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors as commonly used in clinical practice. Furthermore, the findings do not support a short-term reduced risk of AMI with naproxen.", "outbound_citations": ["12383990", "12177647", "12020179", "12020180", "12020178", "12017164", "11909558", "11835924", "11792343", "11809254", "11682368", "11509060", "11028250", "10907963", "10362009", "9141966", "8792943", "3558716"], "inbound_citations": ["36432556", "36223960", "33706309", "34072717", "33338065", "34610992", "32703310", "32105355", "31981225", "31726219", "31242949", "30933230", "30718354", "30543543", "30204233", "30304456", "29556907", "29610570", "28487435", "27498352", "27575590", "27603385", "26983451", "27046153", "25956433", "26484843", "26457127"], "label": "0"}

The principal criterion for efficacy was pain intensity assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS) 15 minutes after drug intake. Pain intensity was further evaluated 30, 45, 90, 120, 180, 240 and 360 minutes after dosing. Pain relief was evaluated at the same time points by means of a categorical scale. The time point of first pain relief, the use of rescue medication and the global evaluation of efficacy were also recorded. The reduction in pain intensity was significantly more pronounced in the nimesulide beta cyclodextrin group at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes (p<0.01). Pain relief was significantly greater (p<0.05) and more rapid with nimesulide beta cyclodextrin. In the patient overall assessment of efficacy, nimesulide beta cyclodextrin and nimesulide were rated excellent or good by 95% and 92% respectively; only one patient in the nimesulide beta cyclodextrin group needed rescue medication. Both study drugs were effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acute dental pain, with nimesulide beta cyclodextrin showing a faster onset of analgesic action.", "outbound_citations": ["7805940"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

This is because they are just as effective as NSAIDs in relieving arthritic pain and yet less gastrotoxic. However, the cardiovascular safety of selective COX-2 inhibitors has been questioned because they selectively reduce prostacyclin production, thus disrupting the normal homeostatic balance and promoting a prothrombotic state. These theoretical concerns appear to be supported by the results of clinical trials demonstrating an increased risk of myocardial infarction with COX-2 inhibitors compared with a conventional NSAID, and indirect comparisons of the rates of myocardial infarction among patients treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor compared with aspirin in different trials. However, emerging data from animal, experimental and clinical studies suggest that COX-2 is atherogenic and thrombogenic, and that selective COX-2 inhibitors may be cardioprotective. Meta-analyses of randomized trials of selective COX-2 inhibitors compared with placebo have demonstrated no excess of cardiovascular events among patients allocated COX-2 inhibitors, and preliminary data from a randomized controlled trial of the selective COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam, in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were treated with aspirin, demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events among patients allocated the COX-2 inhibitor. Conclusions\u2014 Continuing uncertainty regarding the direction and magnitude of any cardiovascular effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors, coupled with their widespread and increasing use, mandates prospective randomized evaluation of their efficacy and safety in patients at increased risk of future cardiovascular events.", "outbound_citations": ["12928948", "12654603", "12383990", "12324561", "12105151", "12105157", "12062697", "12020179", "12020180", "12020178", "11964481", "11956125", "11940542", "11909558", "11835924", "11823092", "11809254", "11514380", "11502709", "11179262", "11087881", "10979111", "10963682", "10943882", "10874543", "10894809", "10625713", "9887164", "10514410", "10093991", "10093990", "10073969", "9874808", "9569176", "9514412", "9058647", "9396515", "8662657", "8648609", "7989608", "6423665", "6776148"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 1061 patients with symptomatic OA of the hip were randomized to receive celecoxib at doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg/day; naproxen 1000 mg/day; or placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated using standard measures of efficacy at baseline, 2\u20134 days after discontinuing previous NSAID or analgesic therapy, and after 2, 6, and 12 weeks of treatment. All doses of celecoxib and naproxen significantly improved the symptoms of OA, at all time points compared with placebo. This sustained treatment effect of celecoxib was dose dependent. In terms of pain relief and improvement in functional capacity, celecoxib 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day were similarly efficacious and were comparable to naproxen.

A Medline and Cancerlit literature search was conducted for the period 1993-2002, and identified literature was reviewed. There is evidence from in vitro studies, as well as animal models, that inhibition of COX-2 may suppress carcinogenesis by affecting a number of pathways of carcinogenesis, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis. Preliminary studies of gastro-intestinal (GI) carcinogenesis suggest that COX-2 inhibitors may represent an approach to the chemoprevention of epithelial cancers. COX-2 inhibitors may have a potential role in chemoprevention of UADT cancer, and clinical trials appear warranted.", "outbound_citations": ["12410942", "12167415", "12167422", "12167423", "12216093", "12167430", "12167439", "12203806", "12100758", "12174888", "12067981", "12138405", "12150615", "11953864", "11978547", "12070598", "11795429", "11564582", "11587608", "11586092", "11900248", "11320076", "11401909", "11503270", "11297256", "11245450", "11140899", "11326316", "10702783", "10866999", "10964046", "10919665", "10899669", "10861458", "10920275", "10925968", "10874015", "10874062", "10841517", "10793327", "10811116", "10815888", "10728694", "10728691", "10690509", "10690511", "10690505", "10667579", "10605031", "11078056", "10579801", "10667472", "10966456", "10604722", "10582676", "10595745", "10452932", "10668483", "10491516", "10369853", "10196169", "10214347", "10070952", "10070951", "9823297", "9790547", "9731479", "9705326", "9630216", "9635856", "9521170", "9515807", "9458081", "9443418", "9472692", "9547657", "9393745", "9230197", "9552692", "9151799", "9096394", "9111217", "9067275", "9160111", "8969167", "8959316", "9039382", "8956742", "8945508", "8824370", "8640560", "8675406", "8643486", "9816241", "8626626", "8583839", "8555245", "8521479", "7723369", "7897221", "7522960", "8082089", "7926468", "8205534", "8172988", "8113389", "8339210", "8339264", "8330340", "1669840", "1886151", "2202902", "2111654", "2514039", "3390835", "3537787", "3731036", "3459461", "3919231", "3880665", "6585268", "6831469", "6799884", "7295159", "5030956"], "inbound_citations": ["36048406", "35883653", "34760800", "34094895", "31576570", "31157709", "30713340", "30002310", "29930772", "29709496", "28892791", "27659090", "27555783", "26826024", "25974157", "26229582", "25939347", "26005470", "25560800", "25579548", "25247252", "25183178", "24646026"], "label": "0"}

The relationship between these two scales and their relative precision in discriminating active from placebo treatment in OA patients was determined. Patient overall pain assessment, and patient and investigator global assessments were each measured on a 100mm VAS and on a 0 to 4 point Likert scale in a 6-week OA study of rofecoxib vs placebo. The relationship between the VAS and Likert responses was examined graphically and via summary statistics. Analysis of variance was used to assess consistency of the VAS/Likert relationship over time and across the different endpoints. Precision was compared using effect size, and normality of VAS scale of measurement was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Mean VAS scores and changes from baseline at individual time points were generally highly correlated with corresponding Likert responses (r-values generally approximately 0.7-0.8). The magnitude of VAS values and changes varied depending on endpoint, on the associated magnitude of increment of Likert score, and on the Likert baseline value (i.e., where on the Likert scale the change was occurring). Precision of VAS and Likert responses to detect difference between treatments was generally similar with effect sizes approximately 1. Normality and homogeneity of variance of VAS scores was most closely approximated by actual changes in comparison to percent change or log-transformed measures. VAS and Likert responses are highly correlated and yield similar precision for discriminating treatments in OA patients. Since Likert responses are easier to administer and interpret, they may be preferable to measure OA response.", "outbound_citations": ["10555907", "10494494", "10494495", "3068365", "3680471", "3785962", "686873"], "inbound_citations": ["36897201", "36576096", "35042904", "34955099", "34621449", "34577583", "34045390", "33843297", "34262619", "33364786", "33518507", "32165553", "31986170", "31756999", "31662383", "33093712", "31390143", "31130745", "30987218", "30676124", "30368550", "30229533", "30209696", "29731662", "29757295", "29463120", "28427806", "28691410", "28532872", "28203597", "28203597", "26844640", "27164979", "27330707", "26689434", "26706183", "26733318", "26726811", "26773321", "27196521", "24735056", "25282389", "24994768"], "label": "0"}

We present five possible analysis strategies to test for heterogeneity of relative treatment effects among strata. These strategies are either identical to or straightforward modifications of strategies that can be used to test for interaction when the objective of the study is to show differences rather than noninferiority. The various analysis strategies implicitly depend on different definitions of interaction. Power of the various tests will be low, a phenomenon that often occurs when testing for interaction. We present simulation results to quantify the power and type I error rates under different scenarios and an example to demonstrate the proposed tests. None of the analysis strategies is best under every parameter configuration. The tests may be best used in a descriptive or exploratory manner.

Some investigators have suggested that the preemptive administration of NSAIDs may reduce postoperative analgesic requirements and hypersensitivity. We evaluated the analgesic effect of administering rofecoxib either before or after surgical incision in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery under local anesthesia. Sixty patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscectomy were randomized into three groups. All patients received intraarticular bupivacaine 0.25% pre- and postsurgery together with IV sedation using midazolam and propofol. The Preincisional group received a single 50 mg dose of rofecoxib 1 h before surgery, the Postincisional group received rofecoxib 50 mg after the completion of surgery, and the Placebo group received a placebo tablet before surgery. Pain scores, the time to first opioid use, and 24-h analgesic use were recorded. Analgesic duration, defined as the time from completion of surgery until first opioid use, was significantly longer in those patients receiving pre- (803 \u00b1 536 min) versus postincisional (461 \u00b1 344 min) rofecoxib or placebo (318 \u00b1 108 min). The 24 h acetaminophen/oxycodone use was less in the Preincisional group (1.5 \u00b1 0.6 pills) versus the Postincisional group (3.3 \u00b1 1.3 pills) or the Placebo group (5.5 \u00b1 1.6 pills). Pain scores with movement were lower in the Preincisional group at all postoperative time intervals. We conclude that rofecoxib provides effective postoperative analgesia for arthroscopic meniscectomy. Further, the administration of rofecoxib 50 mg before surgery provides a longer duration of postoperative analgesia, less 24 h opioid use, and lower incidental pain scores compared with administering the drug after the completion of surgery.", "outbound_citations": ["11805921", "11707804", "11260714", "11220425", "11220417", "11130650", "11049912", "10390125", "10096266", "10418644", "9850777", "9839823", "9579258", "9447876", "8623993", "8571007", "7793557", "7978444", "8172501", "8131242", "8346839", "8461075", "8368408", "1632534", "1929684", "1984919", "1979886", "3281512", "2882607", "3698062", "3839796", "6656869", "18122986"], "inbound_citations": ["35325201", "33797658", "32889557", "32805404", "32077347", "35240772", "30020088", "29044905", "29695926", "28618198", "29245223", "28365208", "28197031", "26952223", "26475164", "25840299", "25537330"], "label": "0"}

However, over the past few years there have been major advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of this tumour and its progression from adenoma to carcinoma that hold potential for translation into novel strategies for the treatment of CRC. Furthermore, newer agents directed against different intracellular targets have also been shown to be efficacious in CRC treatment. Such improvements should continue to lead to increased cure rates in early disease and better overall survival in advanced cases. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the pathogenesis of CRC and to present the evidence base for chemotherapy and some of the novel strategies that are currently being evaluated in phase I and II trials.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32888940", "32911212", "31578316", "31519979"], "label": "0"}

Selective COX-2 inhibitors block ATL formation and exacerbate mucosal injury in rats treated with aspirin. In the present study, we have examined whether inhibition of COX-2 activity in healthy volunteers taking aspirin exacerbates gastric mucosal injury and if such an effect would be prevented by NCX-4016, a NO-releasing derivative of aspirin. Thirty-two volunteers were randomized to receive 2 wk of treatment with NCX-4016 (800 mg twice a day) or aspirin (100 mg once a day) alone or in combination with 200 mg of celecoxib twice a day. Mucosal damage was assessed by endoscopy. The mean mucosal injury score was 5.8 \u00b1 1.8 in subjects treated with aspirin and 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 (P < 0.01 vs. aspirin) in subjects treated with NCX-4016. Administration of celecoxib increased the injury score in volunteers treated with aspirin (9.9 \u00b1 1.9) but not in subjects taking NCX-4016 (1.5 \u00b1 0.8). Aspirin and NCX-4016 caused a comparable suppression of serum thromboxane B2 levels and increased urinary excretion of ATL. Celecoxib inhibited endotoxin-induced prostaglandin E2 generation in whole blood by \u224880% and abolished ATL formation. These findings suggests that (i) aspirin and NCX-4016 trigger ATL formation in humans, (ii) celecoxib inhibits ATL formation and exacerbates the mucosal injury caused by low doses of aspirin, and (iii) the NO-donating moiety of NCX-4016 protects the gastric mucosa even in the presence of suppression of COX-1 and COX-2.", "outbound_citations": ["12709408", "12612897", "12473561", "12404234", "12218086", "12120413", "11496855", "11413151", "11413152", "11087881", "10979111", "10982765", "10930387", "10966456", "10220501", "9808710", "9521569", "8675638", "7568157", "7552725", "7996488", "8145785", "1849272", "2120289", "PMC200199", "PMC296874", "PMC51304", "PMC40824", "PMC200204", "PMC185978", "10681375", "12637254"], "inbound_citations": ["34199647", "33995080", "32224139", "31109107", "30792658", "29397935", "29781354", "29064399", "28867726", "28005273", "27629384", "25895638", "26078973", "25319808", "25708288"], "label": "0"}

A single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge procedure was applied to 60 adult patients (19 male, 41 female; with a mean age of 40.31 +/- 10.44 years, range 20-68 years) with a reliable history of ASA/NSAIDs-intolerance. According to history, the clinical presentations of intolerance were urticaria/angioedema in 32 patients, anaphylactoid reaction in 2 patients, respiratory reaction in 19 patients, and respiratory and cutaneous reaction in 7 patients. Atopy was confirmed by means of skin prick test with inhalant allergens. Oral challenge protocol was started with 25 mg of nimesulide and the remaining 75 mg was given 1 hr later. During the challenge procedure, blood pressure, pulse, nasoocular, pulmonary, and cutaneous symptoms were monitored. Of the 60 patients tested, 55 (91.7%) tolerated the drug with no adverse reaction. Only five (8.3%) patients demonstrated a positive response to oral challenge. The clinical presentations of intolerance to nimesulide were urticaria/angioedema in three patients, mild rhinitis in one patient, and mild dyspnea in one patient. The atopy prevalence was higher, with a ratio of 41.7%, in patients with ASA/NSAIDs intolerance than that of the healthy adult population in Turkey (p < 0.05).

However, the majority of reported side-effects are related to the gastrointestinal (GI) system, and the occurrence of these GI events adds significantly to the disease burden. Several factors have been identified that contribute to the risk of an NSAID-associated GI event. However, when considering risk, especially in clinical trials or observational studies, it is necessary to distinguish between baseline risk and NSAID-attributable risk, since this distinction can affect the results and conclusions of the study; NSAID-attributable risk is present in subjects who have few or no risk factors for upper GI toxicity.

Three hundred and thirty-six patients were treated with oral meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily or diclofenac 100 mg slow release once daily for 6 months. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups with respect to overall pain, pain on movement, global efficacy or quality of life scores at the end of treatment, all of which showed good levels of improvement. Sixty-six patients were withdrawn after the start of the double-blind phase due to adverse events (n = 21, meloxicam; n = 31, diclofenac) or to lack of efficacy (seven in each group). The median of dose paracetamol taken concomitantly was statistically significantly lower in the meloxicam group than in the diclofenac group (185 vs 245 mg/day; P = 0.0123) with a comparable proportion of patients taking concomitant paracetamol therapy in both groups. Both drugs were well tolerated, although severe adverse events, treatment withdrawal and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were more common with diclofenac than with meloxicam.

NSAIDs with high affinity and specifity for Cox-2 hold the promise of maintaining efficacy without the gastrointestinal side effects of conventional NSAIDs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe assessed the gastrointestinal tolerability of flosulide (20 mg twice a day), a highly selective Cox-2 inhibitor with that of naproxen (500 mg twice a day), which has equal affinity for Cox-1 and -2 in 19 patients with osteoarthrosis in a randomized, double blind, crossover endoscopy study. Subjects were treated for 2 weeks with a 2-week washout period. Gastroduodenal damage was primarily assessed as by Lanza (grades 0-4).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo stomach damage was seen in 13 (68%) patients after flosulide and in 5 (37%) after naproxen (P < 0.001).

Large trials of glucocorticoid therapy, hydroxychloroquine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of AD have so far been disappointing.

A 12 h steady-state concentration profile for lithium was obtained at day 14, after which meloxicam was withdrawn. The lithium dose remained unchanged from day 15 to day 22, at which time a second lithium concentration profile was determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLithium and meloxicam were well tolerated throughout the study and all 16 volunteers completed the study. Lithium predose concentrations (Cpre,ss) and area under the curve (AUCss) values both increased by 21% (paired t-test P = 0.0002; 90% confidence intervals for test/reference ratios: 113-130% and 115-128%, respectively) when lithium was coadministered with meloxicam compared with values obtained for lithium alone. The geometric mean lithium Cpre,ss was 0.65 mmol l(-1) when coadministered with meloxicam and 0.54 mmol l(-1) for lithium alone. Lithium Cmax,ss values were increased by 16% by coadministration of meloxicam, from 0.97 mmol l(-1) to 1.12 mmol l(-1). The total plasma clearance of lithium was lower with concomitant meloxicam administration (82.5% of value for lithium alone).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMeloxicam (15 mg) moderately increased the plasma concentration of lithium in healthy volunteers, but by a magnitude thought to be of low clinical relevance. Nevertheless, lithium plasma concentrations should be closely monitored in patients receiving concomitant meloxicam and lithium therapy.", "outbound_citations": ["10430112", "10092958", "9783758", "9783757", "9472840", "9105543", "9084574", "9017771", "8630641", "8628979", "8521679", "7547089", "7990900", "7756095", "7989609", "8006194", "1474532", "1835963", "2772693", "3558329", "3096415", "3711365", "3948485", "3929867", "4026412", "6830407", "6130411", "7273598", "7460473", "7032618", "444956", "8047085", "PMC1598748", "PMC1364932", "PMC330084", "0", "3450848", "PMC1001687"], "inbound_citations": ["31935483", "32238694", "31025773", "28555320", "28054457", "26969262", "26936045", "27393139"], "label": "0"}

Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) is expressed under normal physiologic conditions, whereas COX-2, the inducible isoform, is associated with inflammation. Recent studies have linked COX-2 induction to the asthmatic inflammatory response, but potentially beneficial results, such as enhanced production of antiinflammatory and bronchoprotective substances, may also occur. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of selective COX-2 inhibition on bronchial responsiveness and cough reflex sensitivity. Eight adult subjects with stable asthma underwent spirometry, bronchoprovocation challenge with methacholine, and cough challenge testing with capsaicin, before and after a 7 day course of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (200 mg orally, twice daily) and placebo, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. No significant changes in pulmonary function, bronchial responsiveness, or cough reflex sensitivity were induced by celecoxib. It appears, therefore, that 1 week of therapy with celecoxib does not significantly affect basal airway tone, nor the afferent airway receptors controlling bronchoconstriction and cough. However, the results of this trial cannot be extrapolated to subjects with severe asthma, or those suffering an asthmatic exacerbation. In such conditions of enhanced inflammatory response, the role of selective COX-2 inhibition remains to be elucidated.", "outbound_citations": ["10492503", "10414396", "10228141", "9761007", "9487340", "9138698", "7589405", "7853958", "1489123", "6870071", "746496"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

A double\u2010blind, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled study of 10 days' duration was conducted in 24 healthy adults to compare the effects on platelet function of a supratherapeutic dose of celecoxib (600 mg bid) with a standard dose of naproxen (500 mg bid), a conventional NSAID. Ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to standard agonists (collagen, arachidonate, or U46619 [a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist]), bleeding time, and serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2 level were measured. Unlike celecoxib or placebo, naproxen produced statistically significant reductions in platelet aggregation and serum TxB2 levels and increased bleeding time.

To examine selectivity of tolerated doses of an inhibitor of the inducible COX-2 in humans, we examined the effects of celecoxib on indices of COX-1-dependent platelet thromboxane (Tx) A2 and on systemic biosynthesis of prostacyclin in vivo. Volunteers received doses of 100, 400, or 800 mg of celecoxib or 800 mg of a nonselective inhibitor, ibuprofen. Ibuprofen, but not celecoxib, significantly inhibited TxA2-dependent aggregation, induced ex vivo by arachidonic acid (83 +/- 11% vs. 11. 9 +/- 2.2%; P < 0.005) and by collagen. Neither agent altered aggregation induced by thromboxane mimetic, U46619. Ibuprofen reduced serum TxB2 (-95 +/- 2% vs. -6.9 +/- 4.2%; P < 0.001) and urinary excretion of the major Tx metabolite, 11-dehydro TxB2 (-70 +/- 9.9% vs. -20.3 +/- 5.3%; P < 0.05) when compared with placebo. Despite a failure to suppress TxA2-dependant platelet aggregation, celecoxib had a modest but significant inhibitory effect on serum TxB2 4 hr after dosing. By contrast, both ibuprofen and celecoxib suppressed a biochemical index of COX-2 activity (endotoxin induced PGE2 in whole blood ex vivo) to a comparable degree (-93.3 +/- 2% vs. -83 +/- 6.1%). There was no significant difference between the doses of celecoxib on COX-2 inhibition. Celecoxib and ibuprofen suppressed urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 2,3 dinor 6-keto PGF1alpha. These data suggest that (i) platelet COX-1-dependent aggregation is not inhibited by up to 800 mg of celecoxib; (ii) comparable COX-2 inhibition is attained by celecoxib (100-800 mg) and ibuprofen (800 mg) after acute dosing; and (iii) COX-2 is a major source of systemic prostacyclin biosynthesis in healthy humans.", "outbound_citations": ["3111928", "1324603", "1907252", "PMC51304", "1849272", "PMC49193", "1594589", "8365485", "PMC1138513", "2655580", "PMC296874", "2120289", "9057644", "PMC49714", "1380156", "1382414", "8473346", "8449903", "8215400", "PMC294048", "8132748", "8063757", "9167211", "PMC43549", "8159730", "7926468", "5284360", "7537433", "2081486", "7825862", "9229578", "8781269", "9135032", "9171872", "PMC45366", "7991575", "PMC432905", "1059088", "3686481", "PMC293791", "8282809", "7996488", "PMC436917", "6338043", "7368167", "6342834", "2936207", "2233356", "459714", "3293263", "7738031", "8521477", "8521479", "7631045", "8901870", "8663121", "9171873", "8967954", "7965814", "PMC48050", "8265610", "PMC1564640", "9146894", "PMC508057", "9151799", "9596581", "PMC1909061", "8581280", "9751091", "PMC370209", "7045161", "6436696", "3905048", "3790723", "PMC386396", "3461463", "PMC370922", "7028786", "1860212", "1891022", "6345756", "8860111", "1762060", "8226870", "8018656", "1694171", "PMC38399", "8816815", "9262402", "6231483", "3531859"], "inbound_citations": ["37093356", "36903347", "36792039", "36550479", "36531829", "36189951", "36347177", "35780223", "35470674", "35565237", "34368598", "34182131", "34051366", "33727192", "33799528", "33637672", "33553396", "33484117", "33957835", "33424622", "33339204", "33304828", "33039279", "32962984", "32846106", "32780227", "32848762", "32682574", "32619329", "32470154", "32251635", "32317963", "32218705", "32086052", "31943085", "32894506", "31669590", "31726219", "31611604", "31170016", "31230772", "30795639", "30465738", "29468666", "31994525", "30631366", "30446683", "30339925", "29741779", "30115755", "30066986", "29986191", "29377603", "29540495", "29538453", "28460044", "29193552", "29298774", "29202670", "28877326", "28923362", "28857461", "28865237", "28819782", "29180443", "29129850", "28379623", "28710775", "28571535", "28378879", "28703413", "28651847", "28139830", "28522175", "28569569", "28569217", "28491485", "28347710", "28451639", "27569276", "28124089", "28174685", "27975102", "27740874", "27317138", "27713620", "27547824", "26969126", "27465134", "27547547", "27257008", "27363505", "27020548", "27128623", "27458627", "27240539", "27533522", "26984863", "26954392", "26351780", "26841787", "26608552", "26621246", "27107994", "26701907", "26566186", "25956433", "26513172", "26232500", "27137142", "26201059", "26085050", "26130265", "26166618", "26159321", "25908304", "26160389", "25687825", "26258087", "26017392", "25263946", "25406016", "25750933", "25526689", "25450471", "25467192", "25246044", "25251829", "24698105", "25248433", "25036790", "25016374", "24722246", "25085205", "24461582", "25051129", "24887395", "24819536", "24815497"], "label": "0"}

The study population comprised 600 outpatients with a confirmed endoscopic diagnosis of ulcer and erosion in 1991 and 1992 and 6,000 community controls matched by age and sex. We retrieved the prescription history through a computerized prescription monitoring system. We defined exposure to each study drug as \u201ccurrent\u201d (month of endoscopy and preceding month), \u201crecent\u201d (second or third month preceding endoscopy), and \u201cpast\u201d (fourth to sixth month preceding endoscopy).

Their role in the duodenum of these patients is less certain. The disease modifying activity of specific COX-2 inhibitors has not been explored in humans. Patients and methods: This was a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study of celecoxib (100 mg twice daily (n=34) or 400 mg twice daily (n=32)) versus placebo (n=17), given orally twice daily for six months to patients with FAP. Efficacy was assessed qualitatively by blinded review of shuffled endoscopy videotapes comparing the extent of duodenal polyposis at entry and at six months and quantitatively by measurement of the percentage change in duodenal area covered by discrete and plaque-like adenomas from photographs of high and low density polyposis. Results: Shuffled and blinded video review showed a statistically significant effect of 400 mg twice daily celecoxib compared with placebo treatment (p=0.033) with all five independent observers scoring a beneficial effect. Overall, patients taking celecoxib 400 mg twice daily showed a 14.5% reduction in involved areas compared with a 1.4% for placebo (p=0.436). However, patients with clinically significant disease at baseline (greater than 5% covered by polyps) showed a 31% reduction in involved areas with celecoxib 400 mg twice daily compared with 8% on placebo (p=0.049). Conclusions: A panel of five endoscopists found a significant reduction in duodenal polyposis after six months of treatment with celecoxib 400 mg twice daily.

In fact, there is a paucity of published information comparing the safety and efficacy of these two classes of drugs when used to treat acute pain. This study was designed to compare the safety and analgesic efficacy of an over\u2010the\u2010counter (OTC) analgesic, ibuprofen (Advil Liqui\u2010Gels\u00ae), to the leading prescription COX\u20102 inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex\u00ae).

This trial evaluated the maximum approved OTC dosing regimen (400 mg \u00d7 3, q4\u20106h) of ibuprofen liquigels compared to a single dose of celecoxib (200 mg) and placebo in 174 patients with moderate or severe pain following surgical extraction of impacted third molars. The study design was multiple dose, randomized (stratified by baseline pain and gender), placebo controlled, double blind, double dummy, and parallel group. The onset of pain relief was determined using a two\u2010stopwatch procedure. Treatments were also compared using standard indices of pain intensity and pain relief. The study demonstrated assay sensitivity in that both active medications were significantly more effective than placebo for all efficacy measures. In comparing the two active medications, the time to meaningful relief was significantly shorter, and the mean 4\u2010, 8\u2010, and 12\u2010 hour summed pain relief combined with pain intensity difference scores were significantly higher for ibuprofen liquigels compared with celecoxib (p < 0.001). Analyses of other key efficacy variables, including the time to rescue medication and the patients' overall assessment of study medication, confirmed the superior efficacy of ibuprofen liquigels over celecoxib. Both active treatments were well tolerated, with no differences in incidence or severity of adverse events. Of particular interest, there were no differences in gastrointestinal\u2010related side effects when comparing these doses of ibuprofen liquigels to celecoxib.

This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was designed to compare the analgesic effect of oral rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, and acetaminophen when administered alone or in combination prior to outpatient otolaryngologic surgery. Methods A total of 143 healthy outpatients undergoing elective otolaryngologic surgery were assigned to one of four study groups: group 1 = control (500 mg vitamin C); group 2 = 2 g acetaminophen; group 3 = 50 mg rofecoxib; or group 4 = 2 g acetaminophen and 50 mg rofecoxib. The first oral dose of the study medication was taken 15\u201345 min before surgery, and a second dose of the same medication was administered on the morning after surgery. Recovery times, side effects, and the need for rescue analgesics were recorded. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 24 and 48 h after surgery to assess postdischarge pain, analgesic requirements, nausea, and patient satisfaction with their postoperative pain management and quality of recovery. Peak pain scores and the need for rescue analgesic medication were used as the endpoints for estimating efficacy of the study drugs, while cost to achieve complete satisfaction with analgesia was used in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Results Premedication with rofecoxib (50 mg) was significantly more effective than either placebo or acetaminophen (2 g) in reducing the peak postoperative pain, the need for analgesic medication, and improving the quality of recovery and patient satisfaction. Moreover, the addition of acetaminophen failed to improve its analgesic efficacy. An expenditure for rofecoxib of $16.76 (95% confidence interval, $7.89 to 21.03) and $30.24 (95% confidence interval, $5.25 to 54.20) would obtain complete satisfaction with pain control in one additional patient who would not have been satisfied if placebo or acetaminophen, respectively, had been administered prior to surgery.

Recently, head-to-head, randomized, controlled trials have shown a significantly higher incidence of blood pressure (BP) destabilization and clinically significant edema with rofecoxib than with celecoxib among older, hypertensive patients with osteoarthritis (OA). The objective of this analysis was to estimate the COX-2 specific inhibitor medication costs, in addition to the costs of drugs and physicians' fees, for BP destabilization and clinically significant edema associated with the use of rofecoxib 25 mg QD and celecoxib 200 mg QD in patients with OA and hypertension in a Medicare Choice population (aged > or = 65 years). A decision analysis model was constructed to determine the costs (from the payer's perspective) of treating patients in this population with either of the 2 regimens for 6 weeks. The analysis used pooled data from 2 recent, independently conducted, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials of OA patients aged > or = 65 years with treated hypertension who received either celecoxib 200 mg QD or rofecoxib 25 mg QD for 6 weeks. In the individual trials, rofecoxib was associated with significantly higher rates of destabilized BP (P < 0.032 and P < 0.001) and edema (P < 0.01 and P = 0.045) than celecoxib. For a 100,000-member Medicare Choice population, an estimated 25,630 persons would have OA and hypertension (stages I-III), and an estimated 5126 of these patients would use celecoxib or rofecoxib. The estimated costs were 33,938 dollars (6.2%) higher if all hypertensive patients with OA were treated with rofecoxib rather than celecoxib for 6 weeks.

For all measures of efficacy, at all assessments, improvements from baseline in both celecoxib groups were superior to that seen in the placebo group (P < 0.05). No significant differences in efficacy between the celecoxib groups were observed. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in the 2 celecoxib treatment groups.

Two forms of COX have been identified--COX-1, which is constitutively expressed in most tissues and organs, and the inducible enzyme, COX-2, which has been localized primarily to inflammatory cells and tissues. In an animal model of acute inflammation (injection of carrageenan into the footpad), edema was produced that was associated with marked accumulation of COX-2 mRNA and thromboxane. A selective inhibitor of COX-2 (SC-58125) inhibited edema at the inflammatory site and was analgesic but had no effect on PG production in the stomach and did not cause gastric toxicity.

Outcome measures investigated were endoscopic ulcers, ulcer complications, symptoms, overall dropouts, dropouts due to symptoms, and study quality.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-four RCT met the inclusion criteria. All doses of misoprostol significantly reduced the risk of endoscopic ulcers. Misoprostol 800 microg/day was superior to 400 microg/day for the prevention of endoscopic gastric ulcers (RR 0.18, RR 0.38, respectively; p = 0.0055). A dose-response relationship was not seen with duodenal ulcers. Misoprostol caused diarrhea at all doses, although significantly more at 800 than 400 microg/day (p = 0.0012). Misoprostol was the only prophylactic agent documented to reduce ulcer complications. Standard doses of H2RA were effective at reducing the risk of endoscopic duodenal (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.57) but not gastric ulcers (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50-1.09). Both double dose H2RA and PPI were effective at reducing the risk of endoscopic duodenal and gastric ulcers (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.74 and RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.27-0.51, respectively, for gastric ulcer) and were better tolerated than misoprostol.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMisoprostol, PPI, and double dose H2RA are effective in preventing chronic NSAID related endoscopic gastric and duodenal ulcers. Lower doses of misoprostol are less effective and are still associated with diarrhea. Only misoprostol 800 microg/day has been directly shown to reduce the risk of ulcer complications.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32821151", "31937550", "31356543", "29491719", "29097649", "28361278", "27686941", "27083387", "27003828", "26084136", "25857826", "25653559"], "label": "0"}

It has recently been postulated that NSAIDs' antiinflammatory efficacy arises from inhibition of the COX-2 isoform of cyclooxygenase, whereas inhibition of the COX-1 isoform produces the troublesome and sometimes serious gastric and renal side effects of NSAIDs. A relatively selective COX-2 inhibitor, such as meloxicam, may combine antiinflammatory efficacy with improved tolerability. In volunteers, indomethacin 75 mg, but not meloxicam 7.5 mg, inhibited renal prostaglandin E2 excretion and platelet aggregation (COX-1 mediated effects). Double-blind, randomized trials in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients have shown equivalent antiinflammatory efficacy among meloxicam 7.5 mg or 15 mg and diclofenac 100 mg, naproxen 750 mg, and piroxicam 20 mg. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, meloxicam (7.5 or 15 mg) caused less endoscopically detected gastrointestinal (GI) damage (Lanza scale) than piroxicam 20 mg. The MELISSA study, a double-blind, randomized, 28-day trial in over 9,000 patients showed that meloxicam 7.5 mg caused statistically less total GI toxicity, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea than diclofenac 100 mg, despite equivalent reductions in pain on movement for each treatment. A global safety analysis of clinical trials, representing over 5,600 patients and comprising 170 and 1,100 patient-years of exposure for meloxicam 7.5 mg and 15 mg, respectively, showed that meloxicam caused less GI toxicity and fewer peptic ulcers and GI bleeds than naproxen, diclofenac, or piroxicam. The renal safety profile and incidence of liver function abnormalities with meloxicam is equivalent to other NSAIDs available for clinical use. In conclusion, relatively selective COX-2 inhibition exemplified by meloxicam may offer effective symptom relief with an improved GI tolerability profile.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36792039", "36506727", "33828365", "32674253", "32587280", "32535354", "32251312", "31987594", "31383049", "30086368", "28635891", "27523985", "27435198", "26600514", "25892509", "25650386", "25138254", "24467283"], "label": "1"}

Study drugs were placebo (n = 121) or active NSAID (n = 352). A decrease of at least 50% in pain and/or global assessment and/or functional impairment during the study defined the response to treatment. The percentage of patients discontinuing the study drug over time (life table analysis) permitted the evaluation of both the efficacy and toxicity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 473 recruited patients, the percentage of responders was similar at 1 yr and week 6 with a highly statistically significant difference in favour of the active NSAID groups when compared to placebo (at 1 yr, 17% in the placebo group vs 37, 50 and 43% in the piroxicam 20 mg, meloxicam 15 mg and meloxicam 22.5 mg, respectively, for the patient's overall assessment) without any statistically significant difference between the three active groups. However, evaluation of the patients discontinuing the study drug during the 1 yr of the study permitted the detection of a statistically significant difference between the active NSAID groups. A lower percentage of patients taking meloxicam 22.5 mg had to discontinue the study drug when compared to either meloxicam 15 mg or piroxicam 20 mg (37% vs 53% and 53%, respectively, P < 0.05).

It is unclear whether these effects are associated with differences in thrombogenic risks. To compare the risk for thrombotic cardiovascular events among patients receiving rofecoxib, nonselective NSAIDs, and placebo, cardiovascular safety was assessed in 5,435 participants in 8 phase IIB/III osteoarthritis trials. The median treatment exposure was 31/2 months. The primary end point assessed was the risk of any arterial or venous thrombotic cardiovascular adverse event (AE). A second analysis assessed differences in the Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaboration (APTC) events, a cluster end point that consists of the combined incidence of (1) cardiovascular, hemorrhagic, and unknown death; (2) myocardial infarction; and (3) cerebrovascular accident. Similar rates of thrombotic cardiovascular AEs were reported with rofecoxib, placebo, and comparator nonselective NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, or nabumetone). In trials that compared rofecoxib with NSAIDs, the incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular AEs was 1.93/100 patient-years in the rofecoxib treatment group compared with 2.27/100 patient-years in the combined nonselective NSAID group. In trials that compared rofecoxib with placebo, the incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular AEs was 2.71/100 patient-years in the rofecoxib group compared with 2.57/100 patient-years in the placebo group. Consistent with the risks of cardiovascular AEs, similar rates of APTC events were reported with rofecoxib, placebo, and comparator nonselective NSAIDs.

Whether COX-2-specific inhibitors are associated with fewer clinical GI toxic effects is unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, is associated with a lower incidence of significant upper GI toxic effects and other adverse effects compared with conventional NSAIDs.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), a double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from September 1998 to March 2000.\n\n\nSETTING\nThree hundred eighty-six clinical sites in the United States and Canada.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 8059 patients (>/=18 years old) with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were enrolled in the study, and 7968 received at least 1 dose of study drug. A total of 4573 patients (57%) received treatment for 6 months.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive celecoxib, 400 mg twice per day (2 and 4 times the maximum RA and OA dosages, respectively; n = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg twice per day (n = 1996). Aspirin use for cardiovascular prophylaxis (</=325 mg/d) was permitted.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nIncidence of prospectively defined symptomatic upper GI ulcers and ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) and other adverse effects during the 6-month treatment period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor all patients, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.76% vs 1.45% (P =.09) and 2. 08% vs 3.54% (P =.02), respectively. For patients not taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 0.44% vs 1.27% (P =.04) and 1.40% vs 2.91% (P =.02). For patients taking aspirin, the annualized incidence rates of upper GI ulcer complications alone and combined with symptomatic ulcers for celecoxib vs NSAIDs were 2.01% vs 2.12% (P =.92) and 4.70% vs 6.00% (P =.49). Fewer celecoxib-treated patients than NSAID-treated patients experienced chronic GI blood loss, GI intolerance, hepatotoxicity, or renal toxicity. No difference was noted in the incidence of cardiovascular events between celecoxib and NSAIDs, irrespective of aspirin use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, celecoxib, at dosages greater than those indicated clinically, was associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications combined, as well as other clinically important toxic effects, compared with NSAIDs at standard dosages. The decrease in upper GI toxicity was strongest among patients not taking aspirin concomitantly.

Previous health economic models of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been restricted to evaluating a narrow range of agents within specific health care delivery systems using medical information derived from homogeneous clinical trial data. This paper summarizes the Arthritis Cost Consequence Evaluation System (ACCES)--a pharmacoeconomic model that has been developed to predict and evaluate the costs and consequences associated with the use of celecoxib in patients with arthritis, compared with other NSAIDs and NSAIDs plus gastroprotective agents. The advantage of this model is that it can be customized to reflect local practice patterns, resource utilization and costs, as well as provide context-specific health economic information to a variety of providers and/or decision makers.", "outbound_citations": ["11310194", "10914849", "10860014", "10560596", "10622994", "10369853", "9773924", "9737710", "9712107", "9402773", "9178671", "9146764", "9313391", "8969324", "8858742", "8687261", "8618582", "7625622", "7611589", "7791168", "8091141", "8091142", "8311540", "8215749", "8328732", "1450797", "1573437", "1570496", "1892140", "2109073", "2738358", "2904006", "3142593", "3348239"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

As compared to conventional NSAIDs, celecoxib, a COX-2 specific inhibitor, has been shown in previous single posttreatment endoscopy studies to be associated with lower gastroduodenal ulcer rates. In response to concerns that such studies may under-represent ulceration rates, the present serial endoscopy study was designed to compare cumulative gastroduodenal ulcer rates associated with the use of celecoxib to those of naproxen, a conventional NSAID.METHODS:In this double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study, 537 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomized to treatment with celecoxib 200 mg b.i.d. (n = 270) or naproxen 500 mg b.i.d. (n = 267) for 12 wk. Gastroduodenal damage was determined from esophagogastroduodenoscopy after 4, 8, and 12 wk of therapy. Arthritis efficacy was evaluated with Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments.RESULTS:Gastroduodenal ulcer rates after celecoxib and naproxen treatment were 4% versus 19% in the 0\u20134 wk interval (p < 0.001), 2% versus 14% in the 4\u20138 wk interval (p < 0.001), and 2% versus 10% in the 8\u201312 wk interval (p < 0.001), respectively. After 12 wk of treatment, the cumulative incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers was 9% with celecoxib and 41% with naproxen. In the celecoxib group, gastroduodenal ulcers were significantly associated with Helicobacter pylori status (p < 0.05), concurrent aspirin usage (p = 0.001), and a history of ulcer (p = 0.010), but not with disease type (OA/RA), age, gender, other relevant medical histories, or concurrent corticosteroid or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs usage (p > 0.05). Celecoxib produced a significantly lower incidence rate of both gastric (p < 0.001) and duodenal (p < 0.030) ulcers. The two agents produced similar improvements in Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments of arthritis efficacy. The incidence of adverse events and withdrawal rates did not differ significantly between treatments.CONCLUSIONS:As compared to naproxen (500 mg b.i.d.), use of celecoxib (200 mg b.i.d.), a COX-2 specific agent, at the recommended RA dose and twice the most frequently prescribed OA dose, was associated with lower rates of gastric, duodenal, and gastroduodenal ulcers but had comparable efficacy, in patients with OA and RA.", "outbound_citations": ["10930388", "10609815", "10580457", "10560596", "10440623", "9572317", "9437376", "9872494", "9402773", "9244954", "9135032", "8618582", "8658033", "7991575", "7909103", "8159730", "7907735", "8239849", "8231040", "8357002", "1464605", "1570314", "1569057", "1834002", "1941847", "1712772", "1903902", "1849272", "2038014", "2120205", "2120289", "2183665", "2507542", "2642450", "2831188", "3125548", "3318750", "2861741", "6416259", "6966762", "413839", "14280261", "18150288"], "inbound_citations": ["37093356", "35585779", "34932581", "34304363", "34070062", "33727192", "33213773", "31777200", "31339385", "30878890", "30445482", "30445482", "30445485", "29985937", "28597983", "27534608", "27473188", "26664470", "26448006", "25994306", "25403311", "24937265"], "label": "1"}

Acutely, NSAIDs may be more than mild analgesics, and may provide additional analgesia when combined with opioids. However, NSAIDs have ceiling effects and there is no therapeutic gain from increasing dosages beyond those recommended. As there is no clearly superior NSAID, the choice should be based on experience and the toxicity profile that probably relates to the COX-1:COX-2 ratio. Among the older drugs, ibuprofen seems to have these properties.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to have an opioid-sparing effect. Although the value of a simple narcotic-sparing effect may be questioned in cancer pain treatment, the use of NSAIDs may be useful when the increase in opioid dosage determine the occurrence of opioid toxicity. Like opioids, NSAIDs should not be considered analgesics for a specific type or cause of pain. There is a lack of evidence for any difference between different routes of NSAIDs administration. The long-term toxicity of NSAIDs in cancer pain is poorly defined due to a lack of studies. A variety of strategies have been used in an attempt to reduce the risks associated with NSAID therapy. Those NSAIDs that are weak COX-1 inhibitors may be preferred. In addition, concomitant administration of misoprostol is recommended in patients at increased risk for upper gastrointestinal complications.", "outbound_citations": ["11888000", "10858086", "10355213", "10223581", "10203873", "10363074", "9620101", "9596550", "9596552", "9537209", "9572317", "9494148", "9496404", "9437376", "9520227", "9527748", "9469531", "9365082", "9407344", "9286896", "9255122", "9223838", "9219316", "9120536", "9027269", "9388387", "9010653", "8960011", "8942120", "8813044", "8803382", "8687261", "8890983", "8673987", "8630641", "8658033", "8959200", "8577492", "7595718", "8548089", "7611589", "7586632", "7638569", "7900721", "7847286", "7978444", "7989953", "8016008", "7909103", "8011010", "7907735", "8154516", "8021534", "7999406", "8080670", "8102041", "7682728", "8316389", "8452151", "8471551", "8424523", "8287202", "1283009", "1484195", "1381521", "1408310", "1642936", "1594262", "1589804", "2064886", "1903809", "1823083", "2291751", "2227077", "2196536", "2185963", "2594403", "2689472", "2645561", "2461823", "3802043", "6380281", "6122892", "7002189", "48771"], "inbound_citations": ["36272265", "35976257", "35859316", "34770990", "34064094", "33883784", "33389189", "32551097", "31375184", "30940726", "30481565", "31306996", "29506898", "29843006", "29982219", "29747461", "28526155", "28068545", "25479712", "25127252", "25152629"], "label": "0"}

In this single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group, single-dose study, patients who experienced moderate or severe pain after surgical extraction of at least 2 third molars received a single oral dose of either rofecoxib 50 mg, celecoxib 400 mg, celecoxib 200 mg, ibuprofen 400 mg, or placebo. Patients recorded scores of pain intensity, pain relief, and global assessment at prespecified time intervals throughout the 24-hour period after dosing. The end points were total pain relief (TOPAR) score over 8 hours (TOPAR8; primary end point), TOPAR score over 12 hours (TOPAR12), sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) over 8 and 12 hours (SPID8 and SPID12), patient's global assessment of study drug at 8 hours, time to confirmed perceptible pain relief (ie, time to onset of analgesic effect), peak pain intensity difference (PID), peak pain relief, time to first dose of rescue medication (ie, duration of analgesic effect), and percentage of patients using rescue medication. A total of 482 patients (358 females, 124 males; mean age, 22.1 years) were enrolled. Rofecoxib 50 mg (n = 151 patients) demonstrated significantly greater overall analgesic efficacy compared with celecoxib 400 mg (n = 151), as measured by TOPAR8 (least squares mean [SE] 17.2 [0.8] vs 15.0 [0.8]; P < 0.05) and TOPAR12 (25.3 [1.2] vs 21.0 [1.2]; P < 0.05), as well as a significantly longer duration of analgesic effect (P < 0.05). Time to onset of analgesic effect and peak analgesic effect were similar for rofecoxib 50 mg and celecoxib 400 mg. Rofecoxib also showed significantly greater overall analgesic efficacy than did celecoxib 200 mg (n = 90), including greater TOPAR8 scores (17.2 [0.8] vs 11.5 [1.1]; P < 0.001), faster onset of analgesic effect (P < 0.001), greater peak analgesic effect (P < 0.001 for peak pain relief and peak PID), and longer duration of analgesic effect (P < 0.001). The overall analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg was similar to that of ibuprofen 400 mg (n = 45), except that the duration of analgesic effect of rofecoxib 50 mg was significantly longer (P < 0.001). All active treatments produced significantly greater overall analgesic efficacy compared with that of placebo (P < 0.001 for all scores [TOPAR8, TOPAR12, SPID8, SPID12, and patient's global assessment] for all study drugs). The adverse-events (AE) profile was generally similar in all treatment groups. The 3 most common AEs were nausea, postextraction alveolitis, and vomiting. In this study, rofecoxib 50 mg provided generally superior overall analgesic efficacy compared with that of celecoxib 400 and 200 mg, including a significantly longer duration of analgesic effect.

Intravenous preparation of parecoxib is in Phase III clinical trials for the management of acute and severe post-surgical pain.

Clinical results compare parecoxib with ketorolac, a NSAID, which is the only non-narcotic analgesic available in parenteral formulation that can be administered for the relief of moderate to severe acute pain. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that parecoxib is converted to valdecoxib within a short time following administration by im. or iv. injection. In clinical trials, parecoxib compares favourably with ketorolac and produces less gastric or duodenal ulcers, the predominant adverse effect, than ketorolac. Parecoxib, thus, fulfils some of the desirable characteristics of an ideal non-narcotic analgesic for severe post-surgical pain and has application in other acutely painful conditions. Parecoxib is expected to be filed for approval before the end of 2000 and is expected to be introduced in the market in 2001.

This study was designed to assess the efficacy of preoperative administration of rofecoxib (Vioxx; Merck & Co., Inc., Somerset, NJ) in reducing pain and opioid requirements after single-level lumbar microdiscectomy. METHODS A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 61 consenting patients who were considered American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I or II and who were scheduled for elective single-level lumbar microdiscectomy. Patients received either two doses of rofecoxib 50 mg or a placebo preoperatively. The outcome measures included morphine use in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), discharge times, and side effect profile. Data were analyzed by use of independent sample t tests for continuous variables or &khgr;2 tests for categorical variables. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS The two groups were comparable with respect to patient characteristics, intraoperative opioid and hypnotic consumption, and duration of surgery. Patients in the rofecoxib group required significantly less morphine postoperatively. Significantly more patients in the placebo group reported pain scores greater than 7 at admission to the PACU. Time to first request for analgesia was shorter in the placebo group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. There were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of nausea, time to discharge from the PACU, or hospital stay. CONCLUSION Preoperative rofecoxib is effective in reducing postoperative narcotic consumption in patients undergoing lumbar laminectomy.

If an article met the following criteria (n = 61), it was selected: trials involving adult patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (n = 180), use of nonsalicylate NSAIDs marketed in the United States (n = 101), randomized control trial (n = 81), duration of the trial 4 or more days (n = 78), and use of an efficacy outcome measure (n = 61). Reviewers, \"blinded\" to manufacturer status, evaluated the narrative interpretation of results and extracted numeric data on efficacy and toxicity. Manufacturer-associated trials were defined as those that acknowledged an association with a pharmaceutical manufacturer. Because of the scarcity of non-manufacturer-associated trials (n = 9), we report only on the manufacturer-associated articles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-two publications (85.2%) representing 56 trials were associated with a manufacturer. The manufacturer-associated drug was reported as comparable with (71.4%) or superior to (28.6%) the comparison drug in all 56 trials. These narrative claims of superiority were usually justified with trial data. Of the trials identifying one drug as less toxic (n = 22), the manufacturer-associated drug's safety was reported as superior to the comparison drug in 86.4% of cases. Justification for the narrative interpretation of the trial findings regarding less toxicity was provided in only 12 (54.5%) of 22 trials.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe manufacturer-associated NSAID is almost always reported as being equal or superior in efficacy and toxicity to the comparison drug. These claims of superiority, especially in regard to side effect profiles, are often not supported by trial data. These data raise concerns about selective publication or biased interpretation of results in manufacturer-associated trials.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36474170", "36123074", "35544326", "35497927", "34923810", "34415502", "33777122", "33871856", "32795731", "32505969", "31757280", "32284691", "31738925", "31551086", "29441446", "31365088", "30809104", "30132025", "29116189", "29439079", "28982811", "28608452", "28531333", "28207928", "27389296", "27528247", "27151529", "26949873", "26955572", "26611124", "26505726", "25694324", "25281682"], "label": "0"}

CUTANEOUS adverse reactions to drugs are a common problem in clinical practice. Among them, the urticaria/angioedema syndrome is the most frequent. The drug categories responsible for the majority of cases are antimicrobials and nonsteroidal anti-in \u0304ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (1). A patient with a history of allergic or pseudoallergic reaction to NSAIDs needs an alternative NSAID to take if necessary. The peroral challenge with an alternative NSAID is the most common way to achieve this goal. At the moment, there are no NSAIDs absolutely free of adverse reactions. The drugs that are the best tolerated are acetaminophen (paracetamol) and nimesulide. Meloxicam, \u0304octafenine, and benzydamine seem to be tolerable as well (2\u00b15). Over a period of two and a half years (2 February 1998 to 25 June 2000), some of the patients referred to our outpatient department for unequivocal clinical history of urticaria with or without angioedema to NSAIDs were enrolled in the study. All subjects underwent single-blind, placebocontrolled peroral challenge with meloxicam after giving informed written consent. They presented a forced expiratory volume after 1 s (FEV1) of .80% of predictive value.

A prospective, randomized double-blind comparative trial. Objectives. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of nimesulide, a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2\u2013selective anti-inflammatory agent versus ibuprofen in patients with acute lumbosacral back pain. Summary of Background Data. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been more effective than placebo in patients with uncomplicated acute low back pain in previous randomized controlled trials. The efficacy and tolerability of a new COX-2\u2013selective anti-inflammatory drug have not yet been established. Methods. One hundred four patients aged 18\u201365 years with acute low back pain were enrolled. The patients were randomly allocated either to oral nimesulide (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) or oral ibuprofen (600 mg three times daily for 10 days). Outcome measures on a visual analog scale were an average of the pain intensity and the pain relief, stiffness in the back, functional status, and the results of physical examinations. All side effects were recorded at each visit. Results. With both study therapies, there was a clear improvement in all measured parameters of the pain and back function parameters measured from the third day of treatment onward. The patients\u2019 capacity for daily tasks, showed improvement in both groups (P < 0.001), but a statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in favor of the nimesulide group (P < 0.05) after 10 days. Nimesulide was more effective than ibuprofen in improved lateral bending measurements (P = 0.026). Nimesulide and ibuprofen provided similar degrees of improvement in the modified Schober tests and in the pain intensity and back stiffness scores. More gastrointestinal side effects were reported with ibuprofen than nimesulide, and the comparison showed a trend (P = 0.067). Ten side effects occurred in the nimesulide group in 7 (13%) patients and 13 in the ibuprofen group in 11 (21%) patients. Conclusions. The results confirmed that the COX-2\u2013selective inhibitor nimesulide is an effective and well-tolerated agent for use in general practices to treat acutelow back pain. The incidence of gastrointestinal side effects seems to be lower with nimesulide than with ibuprofen.", "outbound_citations": ["10098565", "9684433", "9636984", "9322325", "8664664", "8595067", "27519197", "7567083", "7744132", "8162464", "7601179", "7506169", "3312930", "2957801", "3516751", "6652383", "6214028", "6450426", "962423", "4134675", "5367290"], "inbound_citations": ["32297973", "31977923", "29053135", "27776141", "26935813", "26414386", "25847016", "25451138", "25756143", "25827308"], "label": "0"}

Rofecoxib specifically inhibits COX-2 and has demonstrated a low potential for causing upper GI injury.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the incidence of PUBs in patients with osteoarthritis treated with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs.\n\n\nDESIGN\nPrespecified analysis of all 8 double-blind, randomized phase 2b/3 rofecoxib osteoarthritis trials conducted from December 1996 through March 1998, including one 6-week dose-ranging study, two 6-week efficacy studies vs ibuprofen and placebo, two 1-year efficacy studies vs diclofenac, two 6-month endoscopy studies vs ibuprofen and placebo, and one 6-week efficacy study vs nabumetone and placebo.\n\n\nSETTING\nMultinational sites. Participants Osteoarthritis patients (N = 5435; mean age, 63 years [range, 38-94 years]; 72.9% women).\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nRofecoxib, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/d (n = 1209, 1603, and 545, respectively, combined) vs ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times per day (n = 847), diclofenac, 50 mg 3 times per day (n = 590); or nabumetone, 1500 mg/d (n = 127) (combined).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nCumulative incidence of PUBs for rofecoxib vs NSAIDs, based on survival analysis of time to first PUB diagnosis, using PUBs that met pre-specified criteria judged by a blinded, external adjudication committee.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of PUBs over 12 months was significantly lower with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs (12-month cumulative incidence, 1.3% vs 1.8%; P = .046; rate per 100 patient-years, 1.33 vs 2.60; relative risk, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-1.00). The cumulative incidence of dyspeptic GI adverse experiences was also lower with rofecoxib vs NSAIDS over 6 months (23.5% vs 25.5%; P = .02), after which the incidence rates converged.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn a combined analysis of 8 trials of patients with osteoarthritis, treatment with rofecoxib was associated with a significantly lower incidence of PUBs than treatment with NSAIDs.", "outbound_citations": ["10096266", "9715832", "9558445", "8628979", "7611589", "7909103", "8132748", "8265610", "8454631", "1400457", "1380156", "3261560", "2869207"], "inbound_citations": ["35234840", "34747609", "34352171", "33820460", "32319141", "31146434", "30588082", "29436371", "29914664", "28569554", "28378356", "27669120", "25879987", "25663820", "25285512", "24667227"], "label": "1"}

Biochemically selective inhibition of COX-2 reduces PGI2 biosynthesis substantially in humans. Because deletion of the PGI2 receptor accelerates atherogenesis in the fat-fed low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse, we wished to determine whether selective inhibition of COX-2 would accelerate atherogenesis in this model. To address this hypothesis, we used dosing with nimesulide, which inhibited COX-2 ex vivo, depressed urinary 2,3 dinor 6-keto PGF1\u03b1 by approximately 60% but had no effect on thromboxane formation by platelets, which only express COX-1. By contrast, the isoform nonspecific inhibitor, indomethacin, suppressed platelet function and thromboxane formation ex vivo and in vivo, coincident with effects on PGI2 biosynthesis indistinguishable from nimesulide. Indomethacin reduced the extent of atherosclerosis by 55 \u00b1 4%, whereas nimesulide failed to increase the rate of atherogenesis. Despite their divergent effects on atherogenesis, both drugs depressed two indices of systemic inflammation, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 to a similar but incomplete degree. Neither drug altered serum lipids and the marked increase in vascular expression of COX-2 during atherogenesis. Accelerated progression of atherosclerosis is unlikely during chronic intake of specific COX-2 inhibitors. Furthermore, evidence that COX-1-derived prostanoids contribute to atherogenesis suggests that controlled evaluation of the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or aspirin on plaque progression in humans is timely.", "outbound_citations": ["10930441", "10913470", "10894809", "10894803", "10835439", "10811855", "10865843", "10655114", "10609815", "10580457", "10514410", "10536706", "10359560", "10369402", "10215647", "9874808", "10539839", "9835625", "9808683", "9771755", "9626023", "9473726", "9262402", "9561177", "7488205", "7857975", "7996488", "7987156", "8018656", "8265610", "8226870", "8504499", "1464605", "1892057", "1907252", "1849272", "2903874", "3790723", "2938849", "4091270", "3971539", "3983893", "6231483", "6517900", "6794597", "7028786", "594390", "802670", "934294", "3300980", "2899772", "PMC2541706", "8918275", "1512604", "9887164", "PMC314330", "PMC51304", "PMC315469", "PMC1867039", "PMC48050", "PMC15129", "PMC370922", "386741", "PMC408370", "2948837", "PMC509152", "PMC5921349", "9013583", "10859290"], "inbound_citations": ["36994095", "35661711", "35367459", "34939923", "34449098", "33937254", "34427537", "32772352", "31779538", "31611817", "31168026", "28978222", "29180445", "28700965", "28644213", "28209797", "27787837", "27159620", "27020548", "27118295", "27075615", "26340462", "26444418", "26493931", "25383727", "26026712", "25429097", "24887395"], "label": "0"}

There were also no changes in gastric mucosal prostaglandin content in any group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese observations suggest that meloxicam causes little acute damage to the upper gastrointestinal tract and piroxicam causes some acute gastric injury but such damage resolves in most subjects by 28 days.", "outbound_citations": ["8405852", "5284360", "8730240", "PMC1373923", "1541410", "PMC1375693", "7959223", "7585013", "7615202", "PMC51304", "1849272", "8630634", "8527613", "8630640", "6600426", "3930341", "8630636", "3048532", "1834002", "PMC2351326", "8664664", "1486187", "8630641"], "inbound_citations": ["34032188", "32164968", "30315290", "29181834", "28730562"], "label": "0"}

Thus, we analyzed the data for celecoxib and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) from the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study to determine the incidences of serious CV thromboembolic events. This trial included 3,987 persons randomized to celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (2,320 person-years of exposure) and 3,981 persons randomized to either ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (2,203 person-years). Because acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) use for CV risk prophylaxis (< or =325 mg/day) was permitted, separate analyses were performed for all patients and those not taking ASA. The incidences of serious CV thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, CV deaths, and peripheral events) were similar, and not significantly different, between celecoxib and NSAID comparators (combined or individually) for all patients as well as the subgroup of patients not taking ASA. This observation was true both for all serious CV thromboembolic events, as well as for individual events. No increase in myocardial infarction was apparent, even in patients not taking ASA who were candidates for secondary prophylaxis for myocardial infarction. The relative risks for celecoxib versus NSAIDs for serious CV thromboembolic events were 1.1 for all patients and 1.1 for the subgroup of patients not taking ASA (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.6 and 0.6 to 1.9, respectively). In addition, the incidences of adverse CV events such as hypertension, edema, and congestive heart failure were similar to, or significantly lower than, NSAID comparators regardless of the use of ASA. Thus, these analyses demonstrate no increased risk of serious CV thromboembolic events associated with celecoxib compared with conventional NSAIDs and therefore do not support the hypothesis of a class adverse effect of cyclooxygenase 2 specific inhibitors on the CV system.", "outbound_citations": ["11509060", "11418144", "11304662", "11087881", "11074741", "10979111", "10874543", "10643694", "10580457", "11139815", "10215647", "9874808", "9635947", "9649928", "9355934", "8375421", "8419003", "2664901", "3790723"], "inbound_citations": ["36729119", "35873629", "35234840", "34932581", "34811895", "33936668", "31168026", "30631366", "30288088", "29674687", "29504415", "29421936", "29202670", "28019014", "27590566", "27049794", "26940257", "26810416", "26695406", "26568890", "26112345", "25857826", "24819958"], "label": "1"}

Effects of indomethacin, the selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors NS-398 and DFU, and dexamethasone on gastric damage induced by 30 min ischaemia followed by 60 min reperfusion (I-R) were investigated in rats. Modulation of gastric levels of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA by I-R was evaluated using Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 2. I-R-induced gastric damage was dose-dependently aggravated by administration of indomethacin (1 - 10 mg kg(-1)), NS-398 (0.4 - 4 mg kg(-1)) or DFU (0.02 - 2 mg kg(-1)) as assessed macroscopically and histologically. 3. Likewise, administration of dexamethasone (1 mg kg(-1)) significantly increased I-R damage. 4. Low doses of 16, 16-dimethyl-prostaglandin(PG)E(2), that did not protect against ethanol-induced mucosal damage, reversed the effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitors, indomethacin and dexamethasone. 5. I-R had no effect on gastric COX-1 mRNA levels but increased COX-2 mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner. Dexamethasone inhibited the I-R-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA. 6. I-R was not associated with a measurable increase in gastric mucosal formation of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) and PGE(2). PG formation was substantially inhibited by indomethacin (10 mg kg(-1)) but was not significantly reduced by NS-398 (4 mg kg(-1)), DFU (2 mg kg(-1)) or dexamethasone (1 mg kg(-1)). 7. The findings indicate that selective COX-2 inhibitors and dexamethasone markedly enhance gastric damage induced by I-R. Thus, whereas COX-2 has no essential role in the maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity under basal conditions, COX-2 is rapidly induced in a pro-ulcerogenic setting and contributes to mucosal defence by minimizing injury. This suggests that in certain situations selective COX-2 inhibitors may have gastrotoxic effects.", "outbound_citations": ["10227244", "9892042", "9766645", "9737710", "9737714", "9705828", "29591260", "9521828", "9616316", "9535022", "9535006", "9663836", "9207278", "9146894", "9024292", "8995303", "8997245", "8903327", "8690211", "8694848", "7503754", "7644521", "7532080", "7926468", "8159730", "8140262", "8365485", "8454631", "8482483", "1380156", "1569057", "1712772", "1987878", "2170222", "2166441", "2154985", "2543228", "2493647", "2446631", "3631303", "3681724", "6417728", "6308617", "6271378", "7017895", "6778761", "506771", "PMC1192075", "9612278", "PMC1565229", "PMC384035", "9929039", "PMC49714", "PMC1727054", "7635765", "PMC41266", "PMC43549", "PMC286758", "PMC507652", "PMC1564640", "38173", "PMC1565228", "PMC1510410", "7664022"], "inbound_citations": ["35633906", "28858733", "26970604", "26469103", "25319808", "25439065", "25521725", "25140201"], "label": "0"}

Methods This double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study compared the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers associated with valdecoxib 10 mg daily (q.d.) and 20 mg q.d. with that of ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily (t.i.d.) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) when administered over a 12-week period. The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers was assessed by upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy, performed at baseline and again at the end of week 12 (or at early study termination). Efficacy assessments were performed at baseline and at weeks 2, 6 and 12 using Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments of Arthritis. Results A total of 1052 osteoarthritis patients were enrolled into the trial. The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers over 12 weeks was 5% in patients receiving valdecoxib 10 mg q.d., 4% in patients receiving valdecoxib 20 mg q.d., 7% in patients receiving placebo, 16% in patients receiving ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. (P < 0.05 v. placebo), and 17% in patients receiving diclofenac 75 mg b.i.d. (P < 0.05 v. placebo). The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers at week 12 seen in the ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. and diclofenac 75 mg b.i.d. groups was significantly higher than that in the valdecoxib 10 mg q.d. and valdecoxib 20 mg q.d. groups (P < 0.05). The incidence rates of gastroduodenal ulcers were not significantly different between the valdecoxib treatment groups or between valdecoxib- and placebo-treated patients. Efficacy responses to valdecoxib 10 mg and 20 mg q.d. were significantly greater than placebo and comparable with both ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d. and diclofenac 75 mg b.i.d. Conclusions The results of the study demonstrate that valdecoxib has an upper-gastrointestinal safety profile typical of a COX-2 specific inhibitor.

Female Sprague Dawley rats, 5 weeks-old, were used for evaluation of KF20444 in the CIA model. Arthritis was evaluated by arthritis score, serum anti-type II collagen antibody titer, body weight loss, radiographical and histological changes. KF20444 was orally administered 5 times per week (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg/day). KF20444 inhibited rat liver dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in vitro with Ki = 8.5 +/- 3.2 nM, which was a comparable effect to that of brequinar sodium (Ki = 25.3 +/- 5.3 nM). The anti-proliferative effect of KF20444 was caused by cell cycle arrest at the S-phase. Treatment with 3 mg/kg/day of KF20444 completely prevented the development of CIA based on reduction of the arthritis score. The 50% effective dose (ED50) of KF20444 on arthritis score was 0.64 mg/kg. KF20444 ameliorated body weight loss associated with disease onset. The compound also inhibited the increase in serum anti-type II collagen antibody level, and reduced both pannus formation and bone erosion. Importantly, KF20444 suppressed the development of arthritis, even when it was administered after booster immunization of collagen. KF20444 is a novel immunosuppressant which inhibits DHO-DHase and its effects in CIA suggest that it could be useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.", "outbound_citations": ["10667841", "10578294", "10455314", "10403258", "9973483", "10083539", "9929017", "9551920", "9451512", "9200452", "9338102", "8962191", "8962195", "8917650", "8687451", "8608941", "8573583", "7473131", "7575649", "7536039", "7529314", "7940736", "8132203", "7685954", "1412717", "1617622", "1531394", "1995903", "3578785", "3019518", "4053030", "6644238", "7052093", "227592", "894190", "184741", "165196"], "inbound_citations": ["36825574", "27721149"], "label": "0"}

The RCTs enrolled 11,008 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis treated for 2\u201324 wk; the long-term open label trial enrolled 5,155 patients receiving celecoxib for a maximum of 2 yr. In the RCTs, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 1,864; 208 patient-years), celecoxib 25\u2013400 mg b.i.d. (n = 6,376; 1,020 patient-years), or a comparator NSAID (n = 2,768; 535 patient-years); NSAIDs were naproxen 500 mg b.i.d., diclofenac 50 or 75 mg b.i.d., or ibuprofen 800 mg t.i.d.). In the long-term, open-label trial, patients received celecoxib 100\u2013400 mg b.i.d. for up to 2 yr (n = 5,155; 5,002 patient-years). The principal outcome measure of this analysis was development of a UGI ulcer complication, which was prospectively defined as bleeding, perforation, or gastric outlet obstruction. Ulcer complications were assessed and adjudicated by persons blinded to the patient's treatment assignment or the study in which the patient participated.RESULTS:In the RCTs, UGI ulcer complications occurred in no placebo patients (0 of 1,864 patients), in 2 of 6,376 celecoxib patients (0.03%), and in 9 of 2,768 patients receiving an NSAID (0.33%), corresponding to annual incidences of 0.20% for celecoxib (p > 0.05vs placebo) and 1.68% for NSAIDs (p = 0.002vs celecoxib and placebo). In the long-term open-label trial, nine UGI ulcer complications occurred, for an incidence of 0.17% and an annualized incidence of 0.18%.CONCLUSIONS:The incidence of UGI ulcer complications associated with celecoxib was 8-fold lower than with nonspecific NSAIDs. The incidence of ulcer complications observed in celecoxib-treated patients was similar to that in patients receiving placebo in the RCTs, and to that in non-NSAID users reported in the literature.", "outbound_citations": ["19078452", "10664917", "10609815", "10580457", "10560596", "9751091", "9596549", "9399978", "9402773", "9391242", "9204251", "9135032", "9116088", "8969678", "8937281", "8781269", "8855725", "7611589", "7711618", "7832763", "7965814", "7909103", "7907735", "1744122", "1834002", "1712772", "1849272", "3114736", "3596334", "6100476", "5284360"], "inbound_citations": ["37093356", "36087627", "32361486", "32328850", "30957659", "30479041", "30892034", "30884758", "30383755", "29853790", "28795997", "28983850", "28569554", "28132905", "26538822", "26448006", "26457127", "26086246", "25601921", "25048053", "25516774", "25243883", "24845457"], "label": "1"}

These risks are usually increased in elderly populations. Parecoxib sodium is an injectable prodrug of the cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitor valdecoxib that has exhibited analgesic activity in previous trials. The purpose of this study was to compare the GI safety and tolerability profile of parecoxib sodium with that of ketorolac, naproxen, and placebo in a 7-day endoscopic trial in elderly subjects. This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. After a normal baseline endoscopy, healthy elderly subjects aged 66 to 75 years were randomized to receive i.v. parecoxib sodium (10 mg BID), oral naproxen (500 mg BID), or placebo for 7 days, or placebo for 2 days followed by i.v. ketorolac (15 mg QID) for 5 days. Endoscopy was performed again after 7 days. Among the first 17 subjects enrolled, ulcers were observed in all treatment groups except the parecoxib sodium group (ketorolac, 4/4 subjects; naproxen, 2/4 subjects; and placebo, 2/5 subjects). Four subjects in the ketorolac group and 1 subject in the naproxen group had multiple gastric ulcers or combined gastric and duodenal ulcers. Because of the unexpectedly high incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers observed, the study was terminated early and the randomization blind broken.

These NSCLC cells also have increased prostaglandin expression (PGE2). Many lung cancers also express 12-lipoxygenase RNA and 12-lipoxygenase protein and biosynthesize 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which correlates with their metastatic potential. Several studies have demonstrated that COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors could inhibit the in vitro growth of human lung cancer cell lines. In this report, we evaluated the growth-inhibitory effects of sulindac sulfide, a COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor; exisulind (sulindac sulfone), a novel proapoptotic agent that does not inhibit COX enzymes; and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor on human lung cancer cell lines. We compared these effects with those of 13-cis-retinoic acid, a chemoprevention agent, and with the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel and cisplatin, alone or in combination. Our goal was to develop new chemoprevention and treatment strategies. Each of the six agents tested inhibited the in vitro growth of three NSCLC and three SCLC cell lines at the highest concentration. Paclitaxel was the most potent agent (IC50 = 0.003-0.150 microM); sulindac sulfide, NDGA, and 13-cis-retinoic acid had intermediate potency (IC50 = 4-80 microM), and cisplatin and exisulind were the least potent (IC50 = 150-500 microM). Combination studies showed synergistic interactions for sulindac sulfide, exisulind, and NDGA with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and 13-cis-retinoic acid, regardless of drug-resistance phenotype. At high concentrations, the combination of 13-cis-retinoic acid and each of the five other drugs resulted in a strong synergistic effect. These studies provide a rationale for chemoprevention (exisulind +/- retinoic acid +/- NDGA) and therapeutic (exisulind +/- paclitaxel +/- cisplatin) studies in patients at risk for, or with, lung cancer.", "outbound_citations": ["9823297", "9731479", "9744528", "9744535", "9849488", "9661890", "9515807", "9615719", "9659587", "17092819", "9449931", "9230200", "9192825", "9169405", "9067547", "9000566", "8391063", "1547522", "1312696", "1855224", "2202902", "2841961", "49354"], "inbound_citations": ["36820994", "36156330", "35275977", "35050491", "34885809", "32325062", "31642411", "31843629", "31257975", "29776741", "28840978", "29228762", "28789344", "28011194", "28808212", "27285378", "27313893", "26822118", "26573786", "26439661", "26396928", "25939347", "25734181", "25086928", "25120722"], "label": "0"}

The purpose of this study was to determine the analgesic efficacy of a single oral dose of rofecoxib 50 mg compared with the combination of codeine 60 mg/acetaminophen 600 mg in a model of postsurgical dental pain. In this double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, parallel-group study, patients experiencing moderate or severe pain after the surgical extraction of > or = 2 third molars, at least 1 of which was a mandibular impaction, were randomized to receive placebo, rofecoxib 50 mg, or codeine 60 mg/acetaminophen 600 mg. Patient evaluations of pain intensity, pain relief, and global assessments were recorded throughout the 24-hour period after dosing. The 2-stopwatch method was used to determine time to confirmed perceptible pain relief. The primary end point assessing overall analgesic effect was total pain relief over 6 hours (TOPAR6). Secondary end points were patient global assessment of response to therapy (PGART) at 6 hours, onset of analgesia, peak analgesic effect, and duration of analgesia. A total of 393 patients were enrolled; 182 received rofecoxib, 180 received codeine/acetaminophen, and 31 received placebo. The overall analgesic effect of rofecoxib 50 mg was greater than that of codeine 60 mg/acetaminophen 600 mg for TOPAR6 (12.4 vs 7.0; P < 0.001) and PGART at 6 hours (P < 0.001). The onset of analgesic effect was similar for rofecoxib and codeine/acetaminophen. Peak analgesic effect as measured by peak pain relief scores during the first 6 hours was significantly greater in the rofecoxib group compared with the codeine/acetaminophen group (P < 0.001), as was the duration of analgesic effect measured by the time to rescue analgesia (9.6 hours vs 2.3 hours, P < 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 33.0%, 46.1%, and 32.3% of patients treated with rofecoxib, codeine/acetaminophen, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse events were nausea (6.0%, 25.0%, and 9.7%, respectively) and vomiting (3.8%, 18.3%, and 6.5%, respectively). Significantly more patients in the codeine/acetaminophen group than in the rofecoxib group experienced adverse events overall (P < 0.050) and nausea in particular (P < 0.001).

NSAIDs (other than aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]) are also enjoying greater popularity as antipyretics since the recognition of Reye's syndrome's putative association with aspirin. In neonates, NSAIDs have been used for many years in an attempt to pharmacologically close the ductus arteriosus. This review examines the various NSAIDs and their potential and real applications in the neonatal population. For completeness, acetaminophen (paracetamol), which has weak NSAID activity and is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic in this patient group, was also included. The prostaglandin system is important for healthy development, and conversely there are unique risks posed by pharmacologic interference with this system in the neonatal period. The prostanoid system in neonates has the capacity to modulate nociception, but comes at the expense of interfering with nearly every organ system. Physiologic effects of inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis applicable to neonates include disruption of the sleep cycle, increased risk of pulmonary hypertension, alterations in cerebral blood flow, decreased renal function, disrupted thermoregulation, and alterations in hemostasis balance, among others. Prostaglandins are also important for the normal development of the central nervous, cardiovascular, and renal systems, and there is evidence that the proper genesis of these systems may be adversely effected by NSAID exposure in utero and in the neonatal period. Gastrointestinal adverse effects have provided the impetus for the development and marketing of selective cyclo-oxygenase type 2 (COX-2) inhibitors.

Over the past few years, cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors have been proved to have certain advantages over non-selective NSAIDs and have been increasingly used for pain management in patients with OA. The main objective of this randomised, double-blind, within-patient study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of three COX-2 inhibitors in 30 patients affected by symptomatic OA of the knee. We evaluated the effects of oral nimesulide (100mg), celecoxib (200mg) and rofecoxib (25mg). Each drug was administered for 7 days. Analgesic efficacy was determined using the patient's assessment of pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and by total pain relief over 3 hours (TOPAR3) on the first and last days of treatment. In addition, the overall analgesic efficacy and tolerability were determined by a global assessment by the patient at the end of each week of treatment, using 5-point categorical scales. At the end of the study, each patient was asked about which of the three forms of treatment they would choose as a continuation of the pain therapy. Taking all the results into consideration, nimesulide proved to be significantly more effective in providing symptomatic relief than did celecoxib and rofecoxib. Furthermore, nimesulide provided more rapid relief of pain associated with walking than did the other two drugs tested. Patients expressed similar preference for nimesulide and rofecoxib, but a lesser preference for celecoxib treatment. No patient withdrew from the study because of adverse events and the three different forms of treatment were generally safe and well tolerated.

Two of these drugs, celecoxib (Celebrex, G.D. Searle & Co., Chicago, Illinois) and rofecoxib (Vioxx, Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, Pennsylvania), are available for use in the United States in patients with osteoarthritis (Figure 1). Celecoxib is also approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (2), and rofecoxib is also approved for treatment of acute pain and menstrual pain (3). Two other COX-2 inhibitors, meloxicam and nimesulide, are available outside the United States. Figure 1. Chemical structures of celecoxib (Celebrex, G.D. Searle and Co., Chicago, Illinois) and rofecoxib (Vioxx, Merck and Co., Inc., West Point, Pennsylvania). Background Cells use cyclooxygenase to convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and then to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), which in turn is converted to physiologically active prostaglandins and thromboxanes (Figure 2). Although cyclooxygenase was once thought to be one enzyme, it is now known that two different cyclooxygenasescyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2can produce PGH2. Cyclooxygenase-1 is expressed at a fairly constant level in most cells, including the gastrointestinal mucosa and platelets. In the gastrointestinal mucosa, COX-1 plays a particularly important physiologic role: Prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), that are produced from COX-1-derived PGH2 protect the gastrointestinal epithelial lining against ulceration. Platelets use COX-1-derived PGH2 to generate thromboxane A2, which assists in hemostasis. Because traditional NSAIDs and aspirin inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 (4), they decrease gastrointestinal synthesis of prostaglandins (predisposing patients to gastrointestinal ulceration) and production of platelet thromboxane A2 (predisposing patients to bleeding). Persons who receive long-term therapy with traditional NSAIDs have more hemorrhages and other ulcer-related complications, hospitalizations, and deaths than those who do not receive such therapy (5). Figure 2. Reactions catalyzed by cyclooxygenase-1 ( COX-1 ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ). PGG PGH In animals, COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the macula densa region of the kidney (6, 7) and in neurons in the cerebral cortex and the limbic region of the brain (8, 9). In many other cells, COX-2 is expressed at very low levels, but its expression can be dramatically upregulated by many stimuli. These stimuli include inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1; mitogens, such as platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor; and bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide (an endotoxin). Selective COX-2 inhibitors and dual COX-1-COX-2 inhibitors result in similar reductions of cytokine-mediated, COX-2-derived prostaglandin production at sites of inflammation. However, the COX-2 inhibitors also reduce the risk for gastrointestinal ulcer formation and bleeding. Therefore, morbidity and mortality associated with use of traditional NSAIDs could be decreased by use of COX-2 inhibitors. In addition, prophylaxis of ulcers could become unnecessary in some patients receiving COX-2 inhibitors. Cyclooxygenase-2 seems to play a vital role in ovulation, fertilization, embryo implantation, and decidua formation in mice (10, 11). Although it is not known whether COX-2 inhibitors would affect these functions in humans, they should not be used in late pregnancy because they could theoretically lead to premature closure of the ductus arteriosus (12, 13). Traditional NSAIDs may cause renal sodium retention with weight gain and edema formation; potassium retention with hyperkalemia; and, rarely, acute renal failure. Because COX-1 and COX-2 are expressed in the kidney (6, 7), it was not clear at first whether selective COX-2 inhibitors would share these effects. Rossat and colleagues (14) reported that in normotensive, salt-depleted persons, celecoxib resulted in decreased urinary outputs of sodium, potassium, and water that were similar to those seen with naproxen. In clinical trials, edema occurred in 2.1% (95% CI, 1.7% to 2.5%) of patients who received celecoxib and 1.1% (CI, 0.6% to 1.6%) of patients who received placebo (12). In rofecoxib trials, edema occurred in 3.7% (CI, 3.0% to 4.4%) of patients in the treatment group and 1.1% (CI, 0.4% to 1.9%) of patients in the placebo group. Because edema may result from therapy with COX-2 inhibitors, they, like dual COX-1-COX-2 inhibitors, should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention, heart failure, and hypertension (12, 13). Because prostaglandins synthesized from COX-2-derived PGH2 may mediate some of the mitogenic effects of several growth factors, COX-2 inhibitors (and dual COX-1-COX-2 inhibitors) could also prove to have a suppressive effect in certain neoplasms. For example, COX-2 messenger RNA is overexpressed in most colorectal tumors and in some colon polyps (15). Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are being evaluated in patients with colon polyps and polyposis syndromes (16). Dual COX-1-COX-2 inhibitors, such as aspirin and sulindac, have been reported to be beneficial in reducing the risk for colorectal adenoma and carcinoma (17) and the number of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (18). Determination of Cyclooxygenase Selectivity A drug's selectivity in inhibiting COX-2 activity is usually determined by observing a reduction in the products of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. When leukocytes are exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, COX-2 catalyzes the reaction that results in synthesis of PGE2. The 50% inhibitory concentration (COX-2 IC50) of a particular drug relative to PGE2 production is often used as a COX-2 assay. Cyclooxygenase-1 assays estimate the drug concentration that reduces generation of platelet-derived thromboxane by 50% during clotting (the COX-1 IC50). Cyclooxgenase-2 selectivity is reflected by a ratio of COX-2 IC50 to the COX-1 IC50 that is less than 1 (4, 19-25). For NSAIDs, such ratios can vary more than 1000-fold (Table 1). New COX-2 inhibitors (meloxicam, nimesulide, flosulide, celecoxib, and rofecoxib) have high COX-2 selectivity and have IC50 ratios of approximately 0.1 or less (Table 1). Table 1. Cyclooxygenase Selectivity of 25 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Role of Cyclooxygenase-1 and Cyclooxygenase-2 in Inflammation, Pain, and Fever Several controlled clinical trials suggest that specific suppression of COX-2 (sparing COX-1) relieves joint inflammation, pain, and fever. However, this issue is not yet entirely clear because some selective COX-2 inhibitors also inhibit COX-1 at therapeutic doses (4, 24, 25). For example, the therapeutic dosage of nimesulide (100 mg/d), a powerful COX-2 inhibitor, results in plasma levels that are high enough to inhibit COX-1, thereby reducing platelet thromboxane production (24). In addition, the experimental COX-2 inhibitor L-745,337 inhibits prostaglandin generation in inflamed bursa tissue in vitro only at concentrations that also inhibit COX-1 (26). In rodents, COX-2 inhibition alone may be insufficient to resolve inflammation and pain, although the relevance of these studies to humans is uncertain. For example, 0.1 mg of the COX-2 inhibitor SC-58125 per kg of body weight produced a 50% inhibition of COX-2 activity in rats. However, a dose 100 times greater was required to reduce inflammation and pain (27). In another study, carrageenan was injected into the paws of rats to induce inflammation. The lowest doses of nimesulide or NS-398 that reduced the inflammation also inhibited COX-1 activity, reduced gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis, and damaged the gastric mucosa (28). Furthermore, NS-398 did not reduce inflammation of the paw in COX-2-deficient mice. However, indomethacin, a dual COX-1-COX-2 inhibitor, reduced the inflammation presumably by blocking COX-1 (28). Carrageenan-induced inflammation of the paw also subsided more slowly in untreated, COX-2-deficient mice than in normal mice; this suggests that COX-2 also generates anti-inflammatory prostanoids. Similarly, COX-2-derived prostaglandin D2 and 15-deoxy 12-14PGJ2 produced by monocytes have a late-acting anti-inflammatory effect on carrageenan-induced pleurisy in rats (29). Celecoxib (100 mg/d to 200 mg/d) was more effective than placebo but less effective than dual COX-1-COX-2 inhibitors, such as ibuprofen (400 mg/d) or naproxen (550 mg/d), in relieving pain after dental surgery (2). Rofecoxib (50 mg/d) was effective in controlling acute pain in adults and menstrual pain in women (3, 13). Rofecoxib (25 mg/d) was also as effective as ibuprofen (400 mg/d) in reducing fever associated with an acute viral syndrome in adults. Both rofecoxib and ibuprofen were superior to placebo (30). Role of Cyclooxygenase-2 in the Gastrointestinal Tract Some evidence suggests that COX-2, like COX-1, may be present in normal gastric mucosa (31, 32), although not every study has found this (33). If COX-2 is present in the normal gastric mucosa, it could play a physiologic role there. For example, when the normal gastric mucosa of rats is exposed to a mild gastric irritant (for example, dilute ethanol), it is protected against subsequent injury by a stronger irritant, such as absolute ethanol (34). This protection is mediated by an increase in endogenous prostaglandin synthesis (34). In animals, selective COX-2 inhibitors (and dual COX-1-COX-2 inhibitors, such as indomethacin) abolish this protective response; this suggests that prostaglandins derived from COX-2 play a critical role in the defense reactions of the gastric mucosa (35). Evidence also suggests that prostaglandins derived from COX-2 may be important in the healing of gastric ulcers (36-38). In experimental gastric erosions or ulcers in rodents, COX-2 (but not COX-1) messenger RNA and protein accumulated in the ulcer margin as a consequence of increased tumor necrosis", "outbound_citations": ["10580458", "10577093", "10430112", "10385625", "10383505", "10391671", "10371510", "10227244", "10225536", "10194467", "9949762", "10096266", "10436769", "29585905", "9736253", "9751091", "9730912", "9649464", "9663182", "9626023", "9572320", "9535022", "9572318", "9506875", "9444611", "9346237", "9404473", "9168834", "9034984", "9051872", "9024292", "9524791", "8982652", "8690211", "8630635", "8630634", "8630632", "8637870", "8862936", "8581280", "8566109", "8829892", "7991575", "7926468", "8037405", "7744131", "7744132", "7601181", "7601179", "8385741", "7680981", "7506169", "2146132", "6869543"], "inbound_citations": ["34628270", "33234769", "31977923", "31755383", "30838041", "31205513", "32185271", "28492740", "27029853", "25201152"], "label": "0"}

Celecoxib, which selectively inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2, is a novel anti-inflammatory drug with minimal gastrointestinal toxic effects while retaining anti-inflammatory efficacy. Our aim was to assess the potential effects of celecoxib on gastric permeability in comparison with placebo and ibuprofen. Design We conducted a prospective, double-blind, cross-over study. Setting This study is carried out at Marmara University Hospital. Participants Twenty-five healthy subjects entered the study but 19 subjects completed the treatment. Intervention Subjects were randomized to celecoxib 100 mg twice daily, ibuprofen 600 mg twice daily or placebo for 7 days in pre-defined sequences. Treatments were separated by a 7 day washout period. Main outcome measure Gastric permeability was assessed by measuring urinary excretion of sucrose spectrophotometrically. Results Ibuprofen 600 mg twice daily produced greater increases in gastric permeability compared with placebo or celecoxib (geometric mean of urinary sucrose recovery was 59.15, 32.65 and 33.11 mg/h for ibuprofen, placebo and celecoxib, respectively) (P < 0.001). Celecoxib was generally better tolerated than ibuprofen.

Patients with exacerbation of osteoarthritis were treated with the recommended dose of meloxicam (7.5 mg) or piroxicam (20 mg) once daily for 28 days; 4320 patients were administered meloxicam and 4336 piroxicam. The incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in the meloxicam group (22.5%) compared with the piroxicam group (27.9%; P < 0.001), mainly due to the significantly lower incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events in the meloxicam than in the piroxicam group (10.3% vs 15.4%,; P < 0.001), while the efficacy of both drugs was equivalent. Individual GI events occurred significantly less often with meloxicam than piroxicam: dyspepsia (3.4% vs 5.8%; P < 0.001), nausea/vomiting (2.5% vs 3.4%; P < 0.05) and abdominal pain (2.1% vs 3.6%; P < 0.001). There were 16 patients with perforations, ulcerations or bleeding (PUBs) of the upper GI tract in the piroxicam group compared with seven in the meloxicam group (relative risk piroxicam:meloxicam = 1.4). Four PUBs were complicated (perforations or bleedings); none of these occurred in the meloxicam group (relative risk piroxicam:meloxicam = 1.9). The outcome of SELECT is consistent with that of the large-scale clinical trial of similar design and size which compared 7.5 mg meloxicam with 100 mg diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis, and with a previous global analysis of the safety of meloxicam.

However, these benefits are obtained at a price. Use of NSAIDs is associated with various gastrointestinal side effects. Minor side effects such as nausea, dyspepsia, anorexia, abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea may affect 10% to 60% of patients [2]. Symptomatic ulcers and potentially life-threatening ulcer complications such as upper gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction are reported in 2% to 4% of patients who take NSAIDs for a year [3]. The chance of hospitalization or death from a gastrointestinal adverse event is 1.3% to 1.6% per year in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [4]. These infrequent but potentially serious gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs have become a major health care problem because of the many patients at risk [5]. General physicians and rheumatologists caring for patients with symptoms of chronic arthritis may be reluctant to abandon using NSAIDs, which help most of these patients, in order to protect the few who may develop serious complications from use of these drugs. On the other hand, gastroenterologists see fewer patients for arthritis but many with serious gastrointestinal complications. Life-threatening events such as perforation or serious hemorrhage from NSAID-induced ulcers, which often develop with little or no warning [6], are a real problem because of the many patients at risk. Various agents have been used in attempts to reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal lesions. In one endoscopic study, cimetidine at a dose of 300 mg four times a day showed no benefit in healing NSAID-related lesions compared with placebo, and 400 mg at bedtime provided no benefit in preventing these lesions compared with placebo [7]. Antacids (magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, 10 to 20 mL as needed to a dose as high as 60 mL daily) and sucralfate have recently been reported to reduce dyspeptic symptoms in arthritic patients receiving NSAIDs in whom gastropathic lesions (but not ulcers) were shown endoscopically [8, 9]. The surface-active antiulcer drug sucralfate was ineffective in preventing ulcers in persons receiving NSAIDs [10, 11], and the histamine-2-receptor antagonist ranitidine did not prevent gastric ulcers but did reduce the frequency of duodenal ulcers [12, 13]. Results of preliminary studies indicate that the effects of omeprazole parallel those of ranitidine [14]. A recent study [15] in achlorhydric patients showed that NSAID-induced ulcers develop in the absence of gastric acid. In contrast, several clinical trials have shown that the incidence of endoscopically visible erosions and ulcers associated with NSAID use can be reduced by cotherapy with the synthetic prostaglandin misoprostol [16-19]. However, it was not proved that preventing endoscopic lesions would prevent clinically serious complications of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal ulcers [20]. Our objective was to determine whether concurrent therapy with misoprostol reduces the incidence of serious upper gastrointestinal complications in older patients with chronic rheumatoid arthritis who are taking NSAIDs. Because most patients taking NSAIDs do not routinely have endoscopy, we investigated the incidence of these complications during clinical care as actually practiced. A second goal was to better define which patients were at increased risk for development of serious NSAID-induced upper gastrointestinal complications. Methods Patients Ambulatory patients at least 52 years of age who had chronic rheumatoid arthritis, defined by American College of Rheumatology criteria [21], and who were expected to be taking 1 of 10 specified NSAIDs at predefined minimum doses for 6 months were sought from practices of family medicine, internal medicine, or rheumatology. Of these practices, 661 in the United States and 3 in Canada enrolled at least one patient between July 1991 and August 1993. For all patients, a medical history was elicited, a physical examination was done, and a modified Health Assessment Questionnaire that included eight items on activities of daily living was administered [22]. Patients were excluded if they had had active peptic ulcer disease within 30 days of study enrollment; were taking or expected to need antiulcer medication (histamine-2 blockers, sucralfate, omeprazole) or any experimental medication during the study; had the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, pyloric or duodenal obstruction, previous gastric resection or vagotomy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, varices, or cirrhosis; had a history of inflammatory bowel disease, upper gastrointestinal tract malignancies, hepatitis, alcoholism, or bleeding diathesis; were estimated to have a life expectancy of less than 8 months or had do-not-resuscitate status; were women of child-bearing potential; or could not tolerate misoprostol or any prostaglandin. The following were the minimum NSAID doses (mg/d) allowed: aspirin, 2000; diclofenac, 100; flurbiprofen, 200; ibuprofen, 1200; indomethacin, 75; ketoprofen, 150; naproxen, 750; piroxicam, 20; sulindac, 200; or tolmetin, 1200. Patients were allowed to receive more than one NSAID. Intervention Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either misoprostol or placebo in the form of 200- micrograms tablets from coded bottles supplied by the manufacturer. Patients were randomly assigned in blocks of four, so that in each block, half the patients would receive misoprostol and half would receive placebo. Because blocks were assigned to investigators, patients were randomly assigned within the individual centers. Investigators were not informed about the randomization procedure but were told only that the study was randomized and double-blind. Patients were instructed to begin taking half a tablet with meals and at bedtime each day for 10 days and then, if the drug was tolerated, to increase the dose to a whole tablet four times a day for the rest of the study. If the drug was not tolerated, the patients were instructed to reduce the dose back to half a tablet four times a day. Patients could continue therapy with arthritis disease-modifying agents (such as gold or corticosteroids) and were allowed to take antacids that did not contain magnesium. Patients purchased their own arthritis medications or antacids and reported their consumption when seen monthly for examination and counts of study medication tablets. Physicians were instructed to watch closely for clinical signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or other possible gastrointestinal complications, to inquire about symptoms, and to investigate suspicious episodes by appropriate clinical procedures. Outcome Measures All suspicious events, regardless of presumed cause, were to be reported, along with all available patient data, to the study medical officer (HWD) and then to an external review committee. This committee consisted of a gastroenterologist (FS), a rheumatologist (Kenneth Brandt, MD, Indiana University), and an epidemiologist (Marie Griffin, MD, MPH, Vanderbilt University). The committee determined, without unblinding the randomization code, whether the patient had upper gastrointestinal bleeding; other ulcer complications; or a problem such as hemorrhoids, diverticulitis, colon polyps, or cancer. It developed definitions of what were considered to be complications related to NSAID use and categories of such complications. The committee reached consensus and assigned such events to one of the following categories of definite upper gastrointestinal complications: 1. perforated ulcer, proved at surgery; 2. gastric outlet obstruction caused by proven ulceration and stricture, proved by endoscopy; 3. hematemesis, with endoscopically proven gastric or duodenal ulceration or erosion; 4. active or recent visualized bleeding from endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion; 5. melena, with endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion; 6. heme-positive stool, with endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion, plus either a) a decrease in hematocrit of at least 0.05 or b) orthostatic change in the pulse rate (from sitting to standing) of at least 20 beats per minute or decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg; 7. hematemesis, without endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion; and 8. melena, with heme-positive stool and without endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion. The committee also defined categories of events not involving clinically significant bleeding: 9. report of melena with no other data; 10. heme-positive stools, with endoscopically proven ulceration or erosion and without active bleeding; and 11. report of melena and heme-negative stools when the stools were tested. Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Methods The placebo group was expected to have an incidence of serious NSAID-induced upper gastrointestinal complications of about 2% per year or about 1% during the 6-month study period. We estimated that the misoprostol group might have 40% to 50% fewer complications and that 60% to 70% of patients would complete the study. Given an less than 0.05 and power greater than 0.80, we planned in the protocol to assess the number of such complications observed, without unblinding the study, after 7500 patients had been followed. We did this to confirm the incidence assumptions and adjust the study size if necessary. We used the Fisher exact test to compare occurrence of events in the treatment groups. To identify risk factors, we evaluated the relation between the occurrence of serious upper gastrointestinal complications and patient characteristics using logistic regression. Supplementary time-to-event analyses were done using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves. The study was supported by a grant from G.D. Searle & Co.

METHODSWe studied 34 patients (mean age, 44.26 yr; standard deviation [SD], 13.09 yr) allocated randomly to receive celecoxib 200 mg twice a day for 72 hours starting on the evening before surgery or placebo capsules in a double-blind study. Fourteen patients received 20 to 80 mg dexamethasone intravenously during surgery (mean, 40 mg; SD, 19.22 mg) because of visible signs of compression of the affected nerve root. After lumbar disc surgery, patients were monitored for visual analog scores for pain at rest and on movement, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) piritramide requirements, and von Frey thresholds in the wound area. RESULTSPain scores decreased and wound von Frey thresholds increased continuously until discharge, with no intergroup differences. Mean 24-hour PCA piritramide requirements were 22.63 mg (SD, 23.72 mg) and 26.14 mg (SD, 22.57 mg) in the celecoxib and placebo groups, respectively (P = not significant). However, patients with intraoperative dexamethasone (n = 14) required only 10.29 mg (SD, 8.55 mg) 24-hour PCA piritramide, in contrast to the 34.25 mg (SD, 24.69 mg) needed in those who did not receive intraoperative dexamethasone (P = 0.001). In addition, 24 hours after the operation, pain scores on movement were significantly lower in the dexamethasone subgroup (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONCelecoxib has no effect on postoperative pain scores and PCA piritramide requirements. The intraoperative use of 20 to 80 mg dexamethasone is able to significantly decrease postoperative piritramide consumption and pain scores on the first day after surgery.", "outbound_citations": ["11950408", "11331167", "11049912", "10842019", "10707400", "10390127", "10227244", "10214482", "9661554", "9010653", "8569017", "8630629", "8624614", "8655940", "8273901", "8433138", "1607978", "2134443", "2218714", "2718048", "3307518", "6462404", "323768"], "inbound_citations": ["36475244", "36265899", "36058564", "33444664", "32361928", "32384500", "31414128", "31308627", "31021886", "31222540", "30681429", "30662111", "30283167", "29718884", "29416464", "29241268", "29046234", "28986051", "26797106", "27026642", "26760402", "26270586", "26424336", "24916651", "26213843", "25911562", "25320134", "24621831", "24885519"], "label": "0"}

Before and after each 2-week period of NSAID intake, laboratory studies were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPlatelet aggregation was significantly less influenced, thromboxane levels were less inhibited (246 vs 117 pg/ml) and bleeding times were less prolonged with meloxicam than with naproxen (3.2 vs 2.3 min). Moreover, the results of all tests during meloxicam exposure were comparable with baseline values.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn RA patients, meloxicam, a representative of the selective COX-2 inhibitors, does not interfere with platelet function and thromboxane levels, in contrast with naproxen (a non-selective COX inhibitor).", "outbound_citations": ["11509060", "10943882", "10664917", "10546927", "10364907", "9929039", "9084574", "7608308", "7876402", "2120205", "2183172", "3358796", "6127382", "5284360", "13871375"], "inbound_citations": ["35019878", "35904290", "34368598", "33093967", "31961516", "30472018", "29556907", "27569276", "27458627", "26558519", "24698769", "25153972"], "label": "0"}

This in turn can lead to unreliable conclusions about treatment effectiveness. Although widely acknowledged as important, no studies in rheumatology have measured the extent of these biases. We identified variables contributing to confounding and investigated the strength of the confounding effect. Analytical methods (propensity scores) are available to mitigate the effect of nonrandom assignment if the full extent of confounding can be understood.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA population of 6637 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) from the practices of 433 US rheumatologists completed 2 sets of detailed questionnaires concerning (1) the last 6 months in 1998 and (2) the first 6 months of 1999, generally prior to and after the release of celecoxib and rofecoxib. Patients who received the COX-2 specific inhibitors in period 2 were identified (n = 1517), and their characteristics were compared to the 5120 who did not start a new COX-2 specific inhibitor during Period 1.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients starting a new COX-2 specific inhibitor had a greater lifetime history of adverse reactions of all kinds, but particularly gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. They also had more severe scores for pain, functional disability, fatigue, helplessness, and global severity, and they used more inpatient and outpatients services than patients who would not switch to COX-2 specific inhibitors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nConfounding by indication and channeling bias result in an overall increase in severity of about 25% for the above measures. Observational studies should account for these biases by a broadly defined propensity score that includes the variables identified in this report. These observations are germane to observational studies of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics, as well, and suggest the need for careful control of confounders when assessing treatment effects in rheumatic disease observational studies.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31118821", "29237621", "27492466", "27575590", "27431503", "26663814", "26932124", "25881857"], "label": "0"}

Therefore, CT-3 may be an effective analgesic for poorly controlled resistant neuropathic pain.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine the analgesic efficacy and safety of CT-3 in chronic neuropathic pain in humans.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nRandomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial conducted in Germany from May-September 2002.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nTwenty-one patients (8 women and 13 men) aged 29 to 65 years (mean, 51 years) who had a clinical presentation and examination consistent with chronic neuropathic pain (for at least 6 months) with hyperalgesia (n = 21) and allodynia (n = 7).\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomized to two 7-day treatment orders in a crossover design. Two daily doses of CT-3 (four 10-mg capsules per day) or identical placebo capsules were given during the first 4 days and 8 capsules per day were given in 2 daily doses in the following 3 days.

Eight hours after intake of the drug, the pain scale differences between groups were less marked. No dose response was observed. Adverse effects, mainly transient dry mouth and tiredness, were reported significantly more often during CT-3 treatment (mean [SD] difference, -0.67 [0.50] for CT-3-placebo sequence vs 0.10 [0.74] for placebo-CT-3 sequence; P =.02). There were no significant differences with respect to vital signs, blood tests, electrocardiogram, Trail-Making Test, and Addiction Research Center Inventory-Marijuana scale.

Meloxicam is a relatively COX\u20102\u2010selective anti\u2010arthritis drug that shows significant TxA2 inhibition, albeit less than traditional NSAIDs. A randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial was conducted in 79 healthy adults to compare the effects of once\u2010daily therapeutic (7.5 mg, 15 mg) and supratherapeutic (30 mg) doses of meloxicam with extended\u2010release indomethacin (Indo\u2010ER 75 mg once daily) on bleeding time, TxA2 formation, and platelet aggregation. The authors measured platelet aggregation to COX\u20101\u2010dependent (ADP, arachidonate) and COX\u20101\u2010independent (high\u2010dose collagen) agonists, bleedingtime, serum TxB2, and clottingtimes (aPTT and PT) after 8 days' administration and at 3 and 6 hours after steady\u2010state dosing. Meloxicam significantly decreased TxB2 production compared with placebo in a dose\u2010dependent fashion, reaching a peak of 77% inhibition 6 hours after 30 mg meloxicam; Indo\u2010ER blocked TxB2 formation by 96% at the same time point. However, neither acute nor 8 days' administration of meloxicam at any dose caused a significant increase in bleeding time or inhibition of platelet aggregation to any agonist when compared with placebo. By contrast, Indo\u2010ER significantly increased the bleeding time and inhibited platelet aggregation to COX\u20101\u2010dependent agonists 6 hours after dosing. Clotting times were unaffected by any drug. It was concluded that unlike nonselective NSAIDs, meloxicam's blockade of TxA2 formation (even at supratherapeutic doses) does not reach levels that result in decreased in vivo platelet function, as measured bybleeding time and aggregometry.

A case history is described of a 52-year-old woman with a temporary colostomy after resection of a sigmoid tumor and who presented with bloody diarrhea 5 days after beginning therapy with rofecoxib. The hemorrhage had its origin in the transverse colon, and the endoscopic appearance was that of actively bleeding acute hemorrhagic colitis. No other colonic lesions were detected, nor was there any evidence of related infection, bleeding diathesis, or other systemic diseases. On discontinuing rofecoxib and instituting parenteral rehydration, the bleeding and diarrhea stopped. Endoscopic follow-up revealed regenerating mucosa in the transverse colon. The time relation, the absence of other causes of hemorrhage, and the clinical evolution all strongly support the probability of a causal relation between rofecoxib and hemorrhagic colitis.

Our goal was to determine the statistical power of predefined dichotomous outcome measures (termed \"a priori\"), compared with that of continuous measures derived from trial data in which there was no predefined response threshold (termed \"data driven\"), and to evaluate the sensitivity to change of these measures in the context of different treatments and early versus later-stage disease. In order to generalize beyond results from a single trial, we performed simulation studies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe obtained summary data from trials comparing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and from comparative coxib-placebo trials to test the power of 2 a priori outcomes, the ACR20 and improvement of the Disease Activity Score (DDAS), as well as 2 data-driven outcomes. We studied patients with early RA and those with later-stage RA (duration of <4 years and 4-9 years, respectively). We performed simulation studies, using the interrelationship of ACR core set measures in the trials to generate multiple trial data sets consistent with the original data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe data-driven outcomes had greater power than did the a priori measures. The DMARD comparison was more powerful in early disease than in later-stage disease (the sample sizes needed to achieve 80% power for the most powerful test were 64 for early disease versus 100 for later disease), but the coxib-versus-placebo comparison was less powerful in early disease than in later disease (the sample sizes needed to achieve 80% power were 200 and 100, respectively). When the effects of treatment on core set items were small and/or inconsistent, power was reduced, particularly for a less broadly based outcome (e.g., DDAS) compared with the ACR20.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe simulation studies demonstrate that data-driven outcome definitions can provide better sensitivity to change than does the ACR20 or DDAS. Using such methods would improve power, but at the expense of trial standardization. The studies also show how patient population and treatment characteristics affect the power of specific outcome measures in RA clinical trials, and provide quantification of those effects.", "outbound_citations": ["12369656", "11764220", "11508441", "11465711", "11087700", "10643696", "10586458", "10513802", "10513507", "10090187", "9082927", "8546736", "8582152", "7779114", "7818570", "8507213", "1642652", "6534410", "7362664"], "inbound_citations": ["37101144", "33738492", "26914724", "27696724"], "label": "0"}

The exact tradeoff between cost and effectiveness is unknown. Contribution This analysis suggests that using rofecoxib and celecoxib rather than naproxen to treat chronic arthritis is cost-effective only for patients with a previous bleeding ulcer or if the cost of COX-2 inhibitors were 10% of its current average wholesale price. Implications At current prices, COX-2 inhibitors offer a cost-effective therapeutic option for treating chronic arthritis only for patients with a previous bleeding ulcer. The Editors Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are prevalent and clinically significant health care problems in the United States today, affecting 15% of the population (1), resulting in more than 100 000 hospitalizations per year (2), and consuming nearly 2.5% of the annual gross domestic product when both direct and indirect costs are considered (3). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used to treat chronic arthritis pain, and they account for 3% of the U.S. prescription drug market (4). These agents are a mainstay of treatment despite their association with clinically significant peptic ulcer complications, including symptomatic ulcers, ulcer hemorrhages, and ulcer perforations (5). Moreover, NSAIDs may induce upper-gastrointestinal (GI) dyspeptic symptoms (6, 7), including epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, and heartburn, even in the absence of endoscopic lesions (8). The decision to use NSAIDs to treat patients with chronic arthritis requires a delicate balance between effective pain relief and potential GI complications. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors, including rofecoxib and celecoxib (coxibs), have been developed as safer alternatives to nonselective NSAIDs and are widely used in clinical practice. When compared with nonselective NSAIDs, including naproxen and ibuprofen, coxibs achieve equal pain relief while reducing upper GI dyspeptic symptoms by 15% (9) and clinically significant ulcer complications by 50% (10-13). For these reasons, the American Pain Society has recently endorsed coxibs as the drug class of choice for the initial management of moderate to severe arthritis pain, although they cost more than nonselective NSAIDs (14). Despite the significant relative risk reduction in GI complications afforded by coxibs, their absolute risk reduction compared with nonselective NSAIDs is only 1% to 2% for overall ulcer complications and less than 1% for significant ulcer complications (ulcer hemorrhages or perforations) (10-13). In addition, although coxibs reduce GI-related utilization of health care resources compared with nonselective NSAIDs in controlled trials, recent data from clinical practice indicate that patients switching from nonselective NSAIDs to coxibs do not have a concurrent decrease in overall GI-related resource utilization (15, 16). The enthusiasm for coxibs may be further tempered by data suggesting that coxibs are associated with a higher rate of cardiovascular events than nonselective NSAIDs (17). For example, one randomized, controlled trial revealed that for every 333 patients treated with rofecoxib instead of naproxen, there was one additional cardiovascular event, including stroke, unstable angina, or acute myocardial infarction (9). Although the reasoning behind this finding is uncertain and controversial (18), the clinical disparity in significant events was highlighted in a systematic review of coxib trials reporting cardiovascular end points (17). Several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports have also raised this concern (19-21). In light of these data, we sought to determine whether the degree of risk reduction in GI complications seen with coxibs offsets their increased cost compared with generic nonselective NSAIDs in the management of chronic arthritis. We performed an economic analysis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of coxibs versus nonselective NSAIDs in the management of chronic arthritis pain. Methods Decision Model Framework Decision analysis is a quantitative method for estimating the financial costs and clinical outcomes of alternative strategies under conditions of uncertainty (22). By using decision-analysis software (DATA 4.0, TreeAge Software, Inc., Williamstown, Massachusetts), we evaluated two strategies for managing a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis who were not taking concurrent aspirin and required long-term NSAID therapy for moderate to severe arthritis pain (Figure 1). Patients with a history of ulcer complications were not included in our base-case analysis but were evaluated in a sensitivity analysis. Patients who entered the hypothetical model did not have GI symptoms and were initially treated with either a coxib (celecoxib, 200 mg once daily, or rofecoxib, 25 mg once daily) or a nonselective NSAID at the maximum FDA-approved dose (modeled after naproxen, 500 mg twice daily). Over the course of a lifetime horizon, the patients either developed a GI complication (nonulcer dyspepsia, symptomatic ulcer, ulcer hemorrhage, or ulcer perforation) or remained free of GI adverse events. Patients without complications continued taking their prescribed therapy, and those with complications required further evaluation. To make our model clinically realistic, we required patients to develop symptoms or clinically significant adverse outcomes to prompt further evaluation. We based our assumptions about patient and physician behavior on patient-centered outcomes rather than surrogate end points, such as endoscopic lesions or ulcer healing rates. To capture the full range of downstream costs generated by each strategy, we included the ongoing cost of care associated with GI events and the probability of developing recurrent events over the course of a lifetime in the model. Figure 1. Truncated decision model. A Model Assumptions To systematically bias our analysis in favor of the coxib strategy, we designed our model to explicitly support a study hypothesis that coxibs are more cost-effective than nonselective NSAIDs. This best case model for coxibs was based on four assumptions (Figure 1). First, all patients developing upper-GI dyspeptic symptoms, including epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, or heartburn, were required to undergo upper endoscopy and were prescribed once-daily proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for the remainder of their lifetimes, regardless of whether an ulcer was identified. Although many patients who develop GI symptoms while taking NSAIDs do not receive endoscopy or long-term PPI therapy, our exaggerated assumption was designed to impart a significant economic penalty for the presence of upper GI symptoms. This assumption economically favors coxibs because they are associated with substantially fewer dyspeptic symptoms than nonselective NSAIDs (9). Second, all patients receiving a nonselective NSAID who developed an upper-GI dyspeptic symptom were also required to discontinue their therapy and switch to a coxib for the remainder of their lifetimes, regardless of whether an ulcer was found on endoscopy. Third, all symptomatic patients found to have an ulcer by upper endoscopy were required to undergo endoscopic biopsy and rapid urease testing for Helicobacter pylori and subsequently received a 14-day course of eradication therapy if positive for H. pylori. Although the role of H. pylori in the pathogenesis of NSAID-related ulcers is controversial (23), we purposely required all patients to be tested and treated for H. pylori to incur an additional economic penalty for the presence of ulcers, therefore biasing the model in favor of coxibs. Finally, although data indicate that nonselective NSAIDs are associated with more GI adverse events than coxibs, a recent FDA review indicates that the incidence of overall serious adverse events is lower with nonselective NSAIDs than with coxibs (7.8% vs. 9.3%) (20). However, to bias our model in favor of coxibs, our base-case analysis included only GI-related adverse events and did not model the observed disparity in adverse events for other organ systems (20). Clinical Data Our base-case model incorporated 23 probability estimates derived from a systematic review of the medical literature (Table 1). We performed a structured search of published reports from the MEDLINE bibliographic databases and hand-searched published abstracts from two major subspecialty journals (Arthritis & Rheumatism and Gastroenterology) to identify English-language publications from January 1985 to December 2002 that pertained to our 23 clinical inputs. We targeted randomized, controlled trials with one or more arms that investigated the use of either nonselective NSAIDs or coxibs in managing chronic arthritis pain and selected trials that reported clinically significant GI complications. Where available, we used summary estimates derived from published systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Where there was a range of data without previous meta-analysis, we used meta-analysis software (RevMan 4.1, Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, United Kingdom) to establish point estimates for use in the decision tree. Table 1. Base-Case Clinical Probability Estimates Clinical Probability Estimates Upper Gastrointestinal Dyspeptic Symptoms Patients Receiving Nonselective NSAID. Upper-GI dyspeptic symptoms include epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, and heartburn. A recent meta-analysis of randomized, controlled NSAID trials reporting upper-GI dyspeptic symptoms as an outcome derived a pooled prevalence of dyspeptic symptoms of 10.9% in the large exposure studies (sample size > 1000 patients); we adopted this as our base-case value (7). Because the precision of this estimate is unlikely to be reproduced among different populations and may vary with duration of therapy, we varied it from 5% to ", "outbound_citations": ["2032518", "12501222", "12456259", "12395955", "12242171", "12242172", "12190159", "12204485", "11984514", "11932876", "11802751", "11790071", "11809181", "11754710", "12369656", "11712877", "11509060", "11519771", "11316141", "11274623", "11242496", "11232673", "11252686", "11128654", "11099680", "11087881", "11115219", "11041909", "10979111", "10930388", "10871971", "10817549", "10789614", "10609815", "10580457", "10580458", "10560596", "10577093", "10521198", "10500058", "10357689", "10072409", "10102948", "9588729", "9495599", "9433865", "9385902", "9377120", "9245224", "9191627", "9153371", "9128309", "9429738", "8892491", "8594244", "7611589", "7613903", "7743311", "7638563", "7527761", "8277174", "8284626", "8135917", "8483401", "8341989", "1833259", "2120690", "3499815", "3493897", "12992243"], "inbound_citations": ["28045603", "25744810", "29702786", "24925692", "26208921"], "label": "0"}

The roles of COX-1 and COX-2 in the pathogenesis of these symptoms are unclear. To test whether COX-2 inhibition with rofecoxib would have greater GI tolerability than nonselective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition, we compared the incidences of (1) treatment discontinuations for GI adverse events (AEs) and (2) prespecified dyspeptic-type GI AEs among patients with osteoarthritis treated with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prespecified, combined analysis of investigator-reported GI AEs in all 8 double-blind, randomized, phase 2b/3 osteoarthritis trials of rofecoxib was conducted. Patients included men and women with osteoarthritis (N = 5435); there was no upper age limit for entry. Treatments tested included rofecoxib, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg (combined), vs ibuprofen, diclofenac, or nabumetone (combined). Primary outcomes were the time (by survival analysis) to (1) treatment discontinuation due to GI AEs and (2) first reported dyspeptic-type GI AE. Between-treatment comparisons were made by log-rank test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe number of treatment discontinuations caused by GI AEs during 12 months was significantly lower (P=.02) with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs (8.2 vs 12.0 per 100 patient-years; relative risk, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.94). The incidence of prespecified dyspeptic-type GI AEs during the first 6 months was significantly lower (P=.02) with rofecoxib vs NSAIDs (69.3 vs 85.2 per 100 patient-years; relative risk, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.97). However, the difference between treatments in dyspeptic-type GI AEs was attenuated after 6 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nRofecoxib was associated with a lower incidence of treatment discontinuations due to GI AEs over 12 months and a lower incidence of dyspeptic-type GI AEs over 6 months than treatment with nonselective COX inhibitors, or NSAIDs.

Various approaches have been taken to developing NSAIDs with reduced gastrointestinal toxicity, and few have been successfully reduced the incidence of adverse reactions. These include cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors and nitric oxide (NO)-releasing NSAIDs. Especially, much has been written about the potential of COX-2 inhibitors as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents that lack the gastrointestinal side effects of traditional NSAIDs. COX-2 expression is most evident at sites of inflammation, while COX-1 accounts for the majority of prostaglandin synthesis in the normal gastrointestinal tract. However, there are distinct examples of circumstances in which COX-2-derived prostaglandins play a role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal mucosal integrity, particularly when the mucosa is injured, and the delineation of COX-1 and COX-2 might not be quite as clear as has been suggested. On the other hand, the rational behind the NO-releasing NSAIDs is that the NO released from the derivatives will exert beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa. This approach has been successfully demonstrated to lessen the incidence of gastrointestinal damage and to promote the healing of gastric ulcers. The present article overviews the roles of COX and NO in housekeeping functions of the gastrointestinal mucosa in various circumstances, and the effects of gastrointestinal sparing NSAIDs, mainly COX-2 selective inhibitors and NO-releasing derivatives of NSAIDs, on the ulcerogenic and healing responses in the gastrointestinal mucosa of experimental animals.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

In addition, celecoxib has some novel therapeutic and pharmacological activities. Celecoxib inhibits anti-apoptotic kinase activation and is the first specific COX-2 inhibitor to be marketed for familial adenomatous polyposis, an inheritable predisposition for colorectal cancer. Celecoxib is not without gastrointestinal (GI) side effects but demonstrates markedly reduced GI ulceration in clinical trials when compared to traditional non-specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The specific COX-2 inhibitors each have distinctive pharmacokinetic properties. Celecoxib can be given either once or twice daily. Racial differences in drug disposition, and pharmacokinetic changes in elderly patients, patients with chronic renal insufficiency and patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, are evident with celecoxib. Despite the specific action of these drugs, there remains the potential for significant drug interactions. Celecoxib has demonstrated interactions with fluconazole, lithium and warfarin. Increased clinical vigilance should be maintained when co-prescribing medications with celecoxib until further clinical experience is gained. Celecoxib represents a major therapeutic advance in terms of GI safety.

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors decrease upper GI clinical events but the effect on lower GI events has not been determined. We performed a post hoc analysis of serious lower GI clinical events with a nonselective NSAID and a COX-2-selective agent in a prospective, double-blind, randomized GI outcomes trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 8076 rheumatoid arthritis patients 50 years or older (or 40 years or older on corticosteroid therapy) expected to require NSAIDs for 1 year or greater were randomly assigned to naproxen 500 mg twice daily or rofecoxib 50 mg daily. The rate of serious lower GI clinical events, defined as bleeding with a 2 g/dL drop in hemoglobin or hospitalization, or hospitalization for perforation, obstruction, ulceration, or diverticulitis, was determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe rate of serious lower GI events per 100 patient-years was 0.41 for rofecoxib and 0.89 for naproxen (relative risk, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.93; P = 0.032). Serious lower GI events accounted for 39.4% of all serious GI events (complicated upper GI event or lower GI event) among patients taking naproxen and 42.7% among those taking rofecoxib.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSerious lower GI events occurred at a rate of 0.9% per year in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking the nonselective NSAID naproxen, accounting for nearly 40% of the serious GI events that developed in these patients. Serious lower GI events were 54% lower with the use of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib.", "outbound_citations": ["8359073", "9149053", "11398914", "11087881", "10986213", "10974182", "9596460", "9596549", "9041228", "7918931", "8500743", "1501650", "1499936", "2015469", "2121310", "3917814"], "inbound_citations": ["36473615", "35049210", "34395945", "34183155", "32937926", "31937550", "31767519", "31720893", "31547642", "31406189", "30996860", "30884758", "30906775", "30632013", "30555323", "30094858", "30012319", "29942215", "29438118", "29320568", "28179185", "28806270", "28652650", "28166082", "27853388", "27783046", "27083387", "27779477", "27213279", "27053860", "26925883", "26747402", "26810416", "27151132", "26457031", "26364932", "26011636", "26004029", "25868717", "25963327", "25721304", "25460554", "25857826", "25319808", "25653559", "25598854", "25088922", "25434661", "24703084", "24602275"], "label": "0"}

Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients treated with antihypertensive medication can lead to destabilization of blood pressure control and other cardiorenal events. The potential for similar interactions with cyclooxygenase-2\u2013specific inhibitors has not been fully explored. The authors evaluated the cardiorenal safety of two new cyclooxygenase-2\u2013specific inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib. MethodsThis study was a 6-week, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trial in patients with osteoarthritis who were \u226565 years of age and were taking antihypertensive agents. Patients received once-daily celecoxib 200 mg or rofecoxib 25 mg. The primary endpoints were the development of edema, changes in systolic blood pressure, and changes in diastolic blood pressure as measured at any time point in the study. Measurements occurred at baseline and after 1, 2, and 6 weeks of treatment. FindingsEight hundred ten patients received study medication (celecoxib, n = 411; rofecoxib, n = 399). Nearly twice as many rofecoxib-compared with celecoxib-treated patients experienced edema (9.5% vs. 4.9%, P = 0.014). Systolic blood pressure increased significantly in 17% of rofecoxib-compared with 11% of celecoxib-treated patients (P = 0.032) at any study time point. Diastolic blood pressure increased in 2.3% of rofecoxib-compared with 1.5% of celecoxib-treated patients (P = 0.44). At week 6, the change from baseline in mean systolic blood pressure was +2.6 mmHg for rofecoxib compared with \u22120.5 mmHg for celecoxib (P = 0.007). ConclusionsPatients taking antihypertensive therapy and receiving cyclooxygenase-2\u2013specific inhibitors should be monitored for the development of cardiorenal events.

To examine the relationship between change of CRP and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) over a 24 mo period to define the sensitivity of HAQ to change.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA prospective study of 109 consecutive patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA and had elevated CRP before steroid or 2nd line therapy. A full clinical assessment including HAQ was performed at presentation and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo. On the basis of the change in CRP at 6 mo, patients were divided into 3 groups: (1) CRP suppression to normal, (2) 50% reduction in CRP, and (3) less than 50% CRP change.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 3 groups were clinically and immunologically similar at onset. At 6 mo the median HAQ fell to 5 (lower to upper quartiles 7.5 to 19) in Group 1 (CRP normalized, n = 34), 6 (3.75 to 10) in Group 2 (CRP reduced by 50%, n = 30), and 12 (6 to 18) in Group 3 (less than 50% CRP change, n = 44), p < 0.005 for Groups 1 and 2 versus Group 3. At 12 and 24 mo HAQ remained significantly lower in Groups 1 and 2 compared with Group 3. In Group 1, patients either maintained a normal CRP (n = 28) or their CRP became elevated (n = 6). Only in those patients in whom a re-elevation of the CRP occurred was deterioration in HAQ subsequently seen.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSuppression of elevated CRP in patients with active RA is associated with improvement in functional score, whereas persistent elevation of CRP is associated with functional deterioration. Once abnormal CRP is suppressed, no functional deterioration is likely to occur without re-elevation in CRP. Therefore, elevated CRP provides a convenient short term correlation with functional outcome and can be used as a guide for therapy. A HAQ score is a sensitive indicator of change in early disease.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32947160", "32260219", "30677239", "31777790", "27188329", "26612523", "25615002", "25698349", "25956953", "25889630"], "label": "1"}

It has been claimed that the new COX\u20102 inhibitors offer advantages in terms of drug safety. To test this hypothesis, the authors compared in a double\u2010blind, randomized trial the effects of celecoxib (200 mg bid) and diclofenac (75 mg bid) on blood pressure and renal function in two groups (each n =12) of young (mean age = 32 years) and elderly (mean age = 68 years) normotensive subjects. Changes from baseline in the 24\u2010hour blood pressure profiles, parameters of the renin\u2010angiotensin\u2010aldosterone system, inulin clearance, urinary marker proteins, and eicosanoid excretion were monitored during the treatment period of 2 weeks. Comparison between celecoxib and diclofenac showed no significant difference in minor alterations of blood pressure. During daytime, there was a trend to elevation of mean arterial blood pressure (mmHg) by celecoxib in the elderly of 2.8 (95% confidence interval [Cl] = \u22122.5 to 8.2) in comparison with the young subjects of \u22121.3 (95% Cl = \u22123.7 to 1.0); there was also a trend to elevation of mean arterial blood pressure by diclofenac in the elderly of 4.1 (95% Cl = \u22121.2 to 9.4) in comparison with the young subjects of 0.4 (95% Cl =\u22122.4 to 3.2). In both populations, the authors found no significant drug effects on the parameters of the renin\u2010angiotensin\u2010aldosterone system, inulin clearance, and urinaiy marker proteins. As expected, diclofenac reduced excretion of all prostanoids, whereas celecoxib did not affect production of TxB2 and its metabolites. Neither in young nor in elderly normotensive subjects were blood pressure and renal function significantly affected by a short\u2010terrn treatment with standard doses of celecoxib and diclofenac.

A total of 462 patients with New York Heart Association classes I to III who were less than 77 years of age and were from 58 institutions in the United States, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom participated in this multicenter, phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial. Patients were allocated at a ratio of 2:1 to parecoxib/valdecoxib or standard care (control) groups, respectively. Intravenous study drug (40 mg) was administered within 30 minutes after extubation and every 12 hours for a minimum of 3 days. Subsequently, oral treatment at a dose of 40 mg every 12 hours was initiated and administered for a combined total of 14 days. Patient-controlled analgesia with morphine, oral opioids, or acetaminophen was available as required. Assessment of the analgesic efficacy of the study drug was primarily based on morphine and morphine equivalent use. Additional efficacy evaluations included daily pain intensity, patient and physician global evaluation of study medication, and pain effect on quality of life. Clinical adverse events were assessed by the principal investigator at each site from the time of the first dose through the 30-day postdosing period. Patients in the parecoxib/valdecoxib group received significantly less morphine or morphine equivalents than patients in the control group during the 0- to 24-hour (P =.009), 24- to 48-hour (P =.017), 72- to 96-hour (P =.002), 96- to 120-hour (P =.004), and 120- to 144-hour (P =.037) periods. Both patients (P <.001) and physicians (P <.001) evaluated the study medication as significantly better than control therapy. The modified Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire used in the oral dosing period detected significant improvements in the parecoxib/valdecoxib treatment group in 6 of 8 domains tested (eg, current pain, worst pain, and mood) beginning on day 4 and continuing for at least 4 days. Although there were no differences between the groups in overall adverse events, serious adverse events occurred twice as frequently in parecoxib/valdecoxib-treated patients (19.0%, 59/311 patients) than in control patients (9.9%, 15/151 patients; P =.015). Regarding individual serious adverse events, a greater incidence in sternal wound infection was found in the parecoxib/valdecoxib patients (10 [3.2%]) versus control patients (0 [0%]) (P =.035). The incidences of other individual serious adverse events, including cerebrovascular complications, myocardial infarction, and renal dysfunction, were proportionally greater but not significantly different between the groups. In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, the cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor combination, parecoxib/valdecoxib, was effective for postoperative analgesia. However, the 14-day treatment regimen also was associated with an increased incidence of serious adverse events overall and sternal wound infections in particular. Therefore our study raises important concerns requiring their comprehensive evaluation in a large-scale trial before these cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors are used in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.", "outbound_citations": ["12397188", "11835924", "11786451", "11782819", "11696466", "11509060", "11519767", "11173048", "11173043", "11173044", "11173045", "11173047", "11173046", "11132739", "11060833", "10936130", "10737277", "10548210", "10451130", "10357329", "10365022", "9951432", "9861122", "9605782", "9454527", "9002496", "8916810", "7907735", "8080219", "8011183", "8105724", "1424027", "1992237", "1992241", "6361561", "6646795", "6968859"], "inbound_citations": ["37093356", "37003853", "35890126", "34994826", "33824647", "31977923", "31073922", "31851755", "30383755", "29202670", "30488949", "30204605", "29029110", "29066931", "28934782", "28703413", "28526157", "28491485", "27888052", "27940550", "27826802", "27533522", "26984863", "26899022", "27034841", "25956433", "26112345", "25918957", "25907164", "26017392", "25940579", "25767411", "25747315", "25340915", "25342992", "24690187", "24218498"], "label": "0"}

Patients received a single, preoperatively administered oral dose of placebo or 10 (oral surgery only), 20, 40, or 80 mg valdecoxib. Analgesic efficacy was assessed postoperatively, over a 24-h treatment period, or until the patient required rescue medication. Efficacy measures included time to rescue medication, proportion of patients requiring such rescue, pain intensity, and the Patient's Global Evaluation of Study Medication.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn both studies, all doses of valdecoxib produced analgesia with a duration (time to rescue analgesia) and magnitude (Pain Intensity, Patient's Global Evaluation) significantly greater than placebo. A dose-dependent effect was observed up to 40 mg valdecoxib, with an 80-mg dose providing no additional analgesic benefit. In both models, all doses of valdecoxib were well tolerated, with no clinically significant treatment-related gastrointestinal, renal, or platelet-derived adverse events, and no evidence of a dose-related increase in adverse events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPreoperative orally administered valdecoxib provides well-tolerated and effective analgesia for mild to moderate postoperative pain.", "outbound_citations": ["12098171", "11260714", "11159230", "11152033", "11065198", "10804043", "10715145", "10796810", "11055820", "10855103", "10566562", "10352661", "10223523", "9852572", "9822210", "9696467", "9597202", "9597150", "10103349", "9516027", "9311400", "9244028", "9085303", "8799525", "8909736", "8773860", "8875548", "7769943", "2234874", "2354100", "3287910", "7053264"], "inbound_citations": ["36361772", "31769260", "35005417", "31583333", "29922745", "28676997"], "label": "0"}

Both parecoxib and valdecoxib inhibit human cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) activity in vitro. Thus, a potential exists for in vivo interactions with other CYP2C9 substrates, including propofol. This investigation determined the influence of parecoxib on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bolus dose propofol in human volunteers. Methods This was a randomized, balanced crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical investigation. Twelve healthy 21- to 37-yr-old subjects were studied after providing institutional review board\u2013approved written informed consent. Each subject received a 2-mg/kg intravenous propofol bolus 1 h after placebo (control) or 40 mg intravenous parecoxib on two occasions. Venous concentrations of propofol, parecoxib, and parecoxib metabolites were determined by mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental analysis. Pharmacodynamic measurements included clinical endpoints, cognitive function (memory, Digit-Symbol Substitution Tests), subjective self-assessment of recovery (Visual Analog Scale) performed at baseline, 15, 30, 60 min after propofol, and sedation depth measured by Bispectral Index. Results Propofol plasma concentrations were similar between placebo- and parecoxib-treated subjects. No significant differences were found in pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution) or pharmacodynamic parameters (clinical endpoints [times to: loss of consciousness, apnea, return of response to voice], Bispectral Index scores, Digit-Symbol Substitution Test scores, memory, Visual Analog Scale scores, propofol EC50).

Thus, the effects of rofecoxib on inhibition of ex vivo serumgenerated thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and platelet aggregation by low doses (81 mg) of aspirin were examined in healthy volunteers. This was a double\u2010blind, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, parallel study of two treatment groups (n = 12 per group) in which subjects received 50 mg of rofecoxib or placebo for 10 days in a blinded fashion. Subjects also received 81 mg aspirin once on each of days 4 through 10 in an open\u2010label fashion. Blood for measurement of serum TXB2 production and platelet aggregation studies was collected on day 1 (prior to rofecoxib/placebo), on day 4 (prior to aspirin), and on day 10 (before and 4 hours following the seventh dose of aspirin). Platelet\u2010derived serum TXB2 (COX\u20101 assay) was measured in blood clotted for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. Platelet aggregation was independently induced employing 1 mM arachidonic acid and 1 \u03bcg/mL collagen as agonists. Rofecoxib administered alone had no significant effect on serum TXB2 production or platelet aggregation (day 4). TXB2 production was inhibited 98.4% by aspirin coadministered with either rofecoxib or placebo (day 10). Similarly, platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid was inhibited 93.7% and 93.5% by aspirin coadministered with either rofecoxib or placebo, respectively (day 10). The comparable values for inhibition of collagen\u2010induced platelet aggregation were 86.8% and 90.8%, respectively. No important clinical or laboratory adverse experiences were observed. In conclusion, rofecoxib alone (50 mg QD for 4 days) did not inhibit serum TXB2 production or platelet aggregation. In addition, rofecoxib (50 mg QD for 10 days) did not alter the antiplatelet effects of low\u2010dose aspirin (inhibition of platelet aggregation and TXB2 production).

Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors appear to alter the balance of vasoactive eicosanoids (prostacyclin and thromboxane) and to suppress the inflammatory mediators implicated in the progression of atherogenesis and ischemic myocardial injury. Neutral, harmful, and beneficial cardiovascular (CV) effects have all been postulated to result from these changes. Investigations conducted with rofecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, have substantially contributed to our understanding of this scientific area. Rofecoxib had little or no effect on platelet aggregation or platelet-derived thromboxane synthesis but reduced systemic prostacyclin synthesis by 50% to 60%. These findings prompted extensive analyses of CV thrombotic events within the rofecoxib development program. Among 5435 osteoarthritis trial participants, similar rates of CV thrombotic events were reported with rofecoxib, placebo, and comparator, nonselective NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, and nabumetone). In the VIGOR gastrointestinal outcomes trial of >8000 patients, naproxen (an NSAID with aspirin-like sustained antiplatelet effects throughout its dosing interval) was associated with a significantly lower risk of CV events than was rofecoxib. A subsequent pooled analysis from 23 studies (including VIGOR) encompassing multiple disease states and including more than 14,000 patient-years at risk also demonstrated that rofecoxib was not associated with excess CV thrombotic events compared with either placebo or nonnaproxen NSAIDs. Again, naproxen appeared to be the outlier, suggesting a cardioprotective benefit of naproxen. Finally, among the predominantly elderly, male population participating in Alzheimer trials, both rofecoxib- and placebo-treated patients had similar rates of CV thrombotic events. The totality of data is not consistent with an increased CV risk among patients taking rofecoxib.", "outbound_citations": ["8907587", "12236854", "12136912", "12045164", "12020179", "12020180", "12020178", "11964481", "11956125", "11909559", "11868054", "11786451", "11792343", "11809254", "12017215", "11752357", "11752364", "11762933", "11733615", "11717412", "11965201", "11705824", "11696466", "11509060", "11514380", "11518732", "11502709", "11496855", "11426020", "11248083", "11171823", "11173047", "11275626", "11392445", "11218076", "11337029", "11185674", "11209977", "11192369", "11087881", "11115219", "11041909", "11028250", "10979111", "10963682", "10952950", "10942685", "10873679", "10874543", "10871971", "10817549", "10733371", "10731924", "10693877", "10580458", "10566565", "10511349", "10500058", "10514410", "10467215", "10377455", "10440619", "10383505", "10215647", "10073969", "9874808", "10539839", "9822058", "9262402", "9077376", "9058647", "8650589", "8147925", "8037411", "8375421", "8435027", "8419003", "1984895", "1969567", "1969518", "3933848", "372242", "1059088"], "inbound_citations": ["36792039", "35762631", "34262622", "33091490", "32251635", "31844085", "31406516", "29480373", "27301402", "27388291", "27575590", "26331692", "24620015", "25298608", "25197169"], "label": "0"}

In rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy, the plasma exudation rate peaked at 5 h, at which time COX-2 was detectable in cells from the pleural exudate. Meloxicam and piroxicam (1 and 3 mg/kg) and NS-398 (3 mg/kg) showed almost equal anti-inflammatory potency against 5-hour pleurisy. A single oral administration of the compounds caused a dose-dependent increase in the number of rats with gastric mucosal erosion. The ED50 value for meloxicam (5.92 mg/kg) was significantly higher than that for piroxicam (1.76 mg/kg), indicating that meloxicam is safer. Indometacin showed intermediate safety (2.59 mg/kg). In in vitro experiments, indometacin inhibited COX-1 about 1.7 times more potently than COX-2. NS-398 inhibited COX-2 with an IC50 of 0.32 microM, but never affected COX-1 activity, even at 100 microM. In the same assay system, meloxicam inhibited COX-2 about 12 times more selectively than COX-1. Piroxicam, however, inhibited both isoforms almost equally. These results indicate that meloxicam is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with low gastric toxicity. One reason for its in vivo pharmacological profile may be related to its relative selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1. Thus, meloxicam may belong to a group of COX-2 selective anti-inflammatory agents with a better safety profile than conventional COX-1 and COX-2 nonselective anti-inflammatory agents.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36402480", "31153785", "29506317", "29256371", "28903825", "25561918", "25356044", "25241126"], "label": "0"}

Valdecoxib is a new, highly selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2\u2013specific inhibitor with a rapid onset of action and significant analgesic properties that is being developed for the management of acute pain. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the opioid-sparing efficacy of valdecoxib as part of a multimodal treatment of pain associated with hip arthroplasty. This multicenter, multiple-dose, double-blind, parallel-group study compared the opioid-sparing effects, analgesic efficacy, and safety of 20-and 40-mg doses of valdecoxib twice daily with placebo in patients receiving morphine by patient-controlled analgesia after hip arthroplasty. Study medication was first administered 1 to 3 hours preoperatively. The total amount of morphine administered, pain intensity, and patient's global evaluation of study medication were assessed over a period of 48 hours. Patients receiving 20 or 40 mg valdecoxib twice daily required on average 40% less morphine than those receiving placebo after hip arthroplasty. Pain intensity levels and patient satisfaction were significantly improved in both valdecoxib groups compared with placebo. Valdecoxib and placebo were equally well tolerated. Pre-and postoperative administration of valdecoxib reduces the amount of morphine required for postoperative pain relief and provides greater analgesic efficacy compared with morphine alone.

The model was evaluated in a prospective study of 149 patients with early RA, monthly CRP assays, and 6-monthly Sharp scores of radiographs of the hands and feet.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTime integrated CRP values correlated closely with radiologic progression in each patient, but there was considerable variation between individuals with similar radiographic scores. The theoretical model accommodated these results, and based on CRP measurements and radiographic scores over 6 months, it provided a k value for each patient that reflected the individual relationship between CRP and radiologic damage. Using this k value combined with actual CRP levels over 3 and 6 years, the model accurately predicted the extent of radiologic progression that was actually observed at these times. Best results were obtained using estimation of the k value from 6 or 12 month observational data. The model has been incorporated into a software program for routine clinical use that indicates the levels to which CRP should fall to prevent further joint damage. Similar results were obtained for ESR.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA model has been established defining the individual relationship between time integrated CRP and ESR values, reflecting rheumatoid disease activity, and progression of radiologic damage. It accurately prediets outcome from 6 months after presentation and can be used as a practical decision support system.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36376988", "33807932", "31935319", "31718678", "31948192", "30677239", "30632540", "29968101", "28724913", "28569212", "28265847", "27522465", "28264816", "29263455", "25416711", "25455156", "25525593", "25128520", "25231819", "25365093", "25050521"], "label": "0"}

This paper explores the potential economic implications of the use of rofecoxib versus nonselective NSAIDs for the treatment of osteoarthritis via a decision analytic model based on rofecoxib clinical data and the published literature. Base-case 1-year analyses were done with data on GI adverse events, specifically perforations, ulcers, and bleeds (PUBs), obtained from a prespecified pooled analysis of the rofecoxib clinical trials. Analyses were also performed using pooled results of two 12-week endoscopic surveillance trials, with adjustments for silent ulcers of 40% and 85%. Under base-case conditions, the expected cost savings in GI problems and comedications averted with rofecoxib versus NSAIDs was 0.81 dollars per day, representing an 85% offset of the difference in drug price. For rofecoxib versus NSAIDs, the expected cost per PUB avoided with rofecoxib was 4738 dollars, and expected cost per year of life saved was 18,614 dollars. In analyses based on endoscopic data, therapy with rofecoxib was less expensive than therapy with NSAIDs, regardless of silent ulcer adjustment. Results were most sensitive to prophylactic GI comedication rates, and were robust over a range of model assumptions and costs. In this analysis based on differences in clinically significant GI events for osteoarthritis patients, cost differences between rofecoxib and NSAIDs were markedly offset by expected cost savings in GI problems and comedications averted with rofecoxib. Costs per year of life saved with rofecoxib versus NSAIDs were well within accepted benchmarks for cost-effectiveness. When endoscopic data alone were considered, rofecoxib was cost saving across all assumptions about silent ulcer rates.", "outbound_citations": ["11179238", "11276801", "10904451", "10871971", "10817549", "10693877", "10628594", "10580458", "10500058", "10203431", "9855174", "9715832", "9588729", "9572324", "10178500", "9433865", "9402773", "9444455", "9146764", "8917329", "8687261", "8664664", "7488273", "8750407", "7611589", "8039085", "7909103", "7907735", "8265610", "8457220", "8474076", "1628906", "2038014", "1903808", "2120690", "2505706", "2642450", "2904006", "3348239", "6371307"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

In this disease, the chemopreventive effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be related to their inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied the effect of celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, on colorectal polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 77 patients to treatment with celecoxib (100 or 400 mg twice daily) or placebo for six months. Patients underwent endoscopy at the beginning and end of the study. We determined the number and size of polyps from photographs and videotapes; the response to treatment was expressed as the mean percent change from base line.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt base line, the mean (+/-SD) number of polyps in focal areas where polyps were counted was 15.5+/-13.4 in the 15 patients assigned to placebo, 11.5+/-8.5 in the 32 patients assigned to 100 mg of celecoxib twice a day, and 12.3+/-8.2 in the 30 patients assigned to 400 mg of celecoxib twice a day (P=0.66 for the comparison among groups). After six months, the patients receiving 400 mg of celecoxib twice a day had a 28.0 percent reduction in the mean number of colorectal polyps (P=0.003 for the comparison with placebo) and a 30.7 percent reduction in the polyp burden (the sum of polyp diameters) (P=0.001), as compared with reductions of 4.5 and 4.9 percent, respectively, in the placebo group. The improvement in the extent of colorectal polyposis in the group receiving 400 mg twice a day was confirmed by a panel of endoscopists who reviewed the videotapes. The reductions in the group receiving 100 mg of celecoxib twice a day were 11.9 percent (P=0.33 for the comparison with placebo) and 14.6 percent (P=0.09), respectively. The incidence of adverse events was similar among the groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, six months of twice-daily treatment with 400 mg of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, leads to a significant reduction in the number of colorectal polyps.", "outbound_citations": ["10369853", "9927187", "9811310", "9751091", "9458081", "9230200", "9249645", "9012840", "9002004", "9561120", "8945508", "8840961", "8653697", "8521479", "7657130", "7634976", "7780968", "7832763", "7926468", "8076772", "8037405", "8052854", "8298943", "8353834", "8385741", "1528264", "1659272", "1669840", "1650315", "1651562", "1759994", "3390835", "6887943", "7471122"], "inbound_citations": ["37165697", "37113586", "37108756", "37029841", "37046763", "36988046", "36985723", "36923425", "36813233", "36692829", "36551963", "36556972", "36553450", "36298592", "36087627", "35962368", "36185863", "36153112", "35902507", "35890126", "35798022", "35764787", "35694899", "35636921", "35585779", "35570229", "35988962", "35988966", "35269660", "34984819", "35057027", "34857698", "34443670", "34279934", "34266857", "34185173", "34122428", "34019782", "34063506", "33893298", "33812575", "33812493", "33812492", "33628741", "33667839", "33509804", "34211259", "33374459", "33328390", "33300198", "34610992", "33437151", "33343991", "33220601", "33208600", "33294257", "33238464", "33031275", "33025506", "33015377", "33033527", "32934706", "32973519", "32752153", "32650550", "32507936", "32601342", "32498447", "32266177", "32227417", "32325966", "32269737", "32171525", "32169282", "32151704", "32131561", "32112902", "32086499", "31994315", "32138838", "31038071", "31622622", "31563626", "31850977", "31817109", "31780574", "31726219", "31536956", "31111530", "31604405", "31100474", "30820968", "31530543", "31440123", "31318093", "31122736", "29420684", "31262194", "31132889", "31020311", "31034926", "30584801", "30925028", "30585890", "30585891", "30819896", "30690875", "30847405", "30783074", "30715618", "30665732", "31559366", "30347274", "29714143", "29512148", "31629465", "31451211", "31033488", "30009698", "30514977", "29627343", "30555636", "30161027", "30333551", "30568688", "30217246", "29864420", "30200215", "30183370", "30189271", "30214544", "29923556", "29982480", "29661728", "29421522", "31773066", "29720902", "29616131", "29428221", "29720901", "29623501", "29491011", "29540495", "29206907", "29343809", "29202670", "29806488", "29316620", "29329257", "29174953", "29416648", "29434827", "30459046", "28948694", "31583304", "29263155", "29028945", "26686322", "29032044", "28939645", "29022408", "29142519", "29472948", "28923228", "28959684", "27810226", "28713941", "28796726", "28720504", "28790112", "28378879", "28765715", "28718684", "28682183", "27128580", "28635355", "28583127", "28501255", "28501250", "28285845", "28413499", "28418862", "28282278", "28785563", "27940058", "28079135", "28045548", "27761963", "28849572", "28386336", "28007462", "28787469", "27998883", "27091391", "27530656", "27938787", "27884749", "27612668", "26464283", "27835591", "27777129", "27780807", "27877214", "27645552", "27672271", "27430377", "27367234", "27480131", "27432344", "26769407", "27429001", "27207660", "27095653", "26893159", "27056662", "27031855", "27092331", "27020655", "27002448", "26915684", "26956214", "26775730", "27039721", "27039732", "26932709", "26931344", "26950454", "26981198", "26893066", "26882261", "26558688", "26970132", "27057439", "27308637", "26414675", "26979937", "29206386", "26549540", "26802941", "26548623", "25951989", "26569228", "26586936", "26513172", "26225471", "26116902", "26033783", "26364615", "26378024", "25770059", "26109217", "26284997", "26622316", "28868409", "26265988", "26251576", "26223300", "26187794", "26093284", "25908304", "26211576", "25555743", "25939347", "25955461", "25650335", "25951487", "25931827", "25597952", "25263946", "25589413", "25792707", "25399784", "25434586", "25351347", "27127412", "25452783", "24975382", "25432409", "25449604", "25464095", "25531498", "25347472", "24706410", "25248683", "25190452", "24932515", "25258577", "25113252", "24969217", "24934992", "24400667", "25060262", "25003576", "25023354", "24670930", "24987355", "24576779", "24887090", "25303258"], "label": "0"}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate steady-state pharmacokinetics, biochemical selectivity and tolerability of rofecoxib (Vioxx), characterized in vitro as a COX-2 inhibitor. Four panels of healthy men (n = 8 per panel) were administered rofecoxib (n = 6) (25, 100, 250, 375 mg) or placebo (n = 2) once daily on day 1 and days 3-14. Blood samples for assays of rofecoxib plasma concentration and COX isoform activity were obtained pre-dose and at specified time points post-dose. Rofecoxib pharmacokinetics were found to be complex and nonlinear. Elimination half-life ranged from 9.9 h to 17.5 h after multiple dosing with an accumulation ratio close to 2 for all doses. COX-2 inhibitory activity as assessed by average inhibition of whole blood lipopolysaccharide-stimulated prostaglandin E2 over the 8-h post-dose period on day 14 was 0.3, 67, 96, 92 and 96% for the placebo and the 25-, 100-, 250- and 375-mg treatment groups, respectively. No treatment group showed significant inhibition of COX-1 as assessed by thromboxane B2 generation in clotting whole blood. Side effects were mild and transient.

Contribution This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 5557 patients with osteoarthritis includes patients typical of community practice: older patients with comorbid conditions and patients using aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. Rofecoxib and naproxen therapies were discontinued by 5.9% and 8.1% of patients, respectively, because of gastrointestinal side effects. Among low-dose aspirin users, 5.2% taking rofecoxib and 9.4% taking naproxen discontinued using the drugs. Cautions The trial tested daily doses of medicines for a short period (3 months) rather than long-term, intermittent dosing based on symptoms. The Editors Osteoarthritis usually affects older persons who frequently take many medications for comorbid conditions (1-3). Patients with osteoarthritis often use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat symptoms because of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs; in addition, NSAIDs are preferred to simple analgesics such as acetaminophen or mild opiates (4). Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity is a common side effect of dual cyclooxygenase (COX)-1- and COX-2-inhibiting NSAIDs. In older patients, GI toxicity is increased by concomitant aspirin use, previous GI intolerability, and other comorbid conditions. The 2 main forms of NSAID-induced GI toxicity manifest as serious alterations in mucosal integrity (leading to perforations, ulcers, and GI bleeding) and GI intolerability, which is more common. Gastrointestinal intolerability is exemplified by dyspepsia, constipation, and abdominal pain that in its most severe form prompts discontinuation of therapy or initiation of treatment with GI protective agents. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs affect prostaglandin synthesis through dual inhibition of COX isoforms COX-1 and COX-2 (5-8). Cyclooxygenase-1 is responsible for producing prostanoids involved in GI mucosal protection and normal platelet function, while COX-2 leads to the production of prostaglandins that mediate pain and inflammation (9-11). Gastrointestinal toxicity induced by NSAIDs is thought to be principally caused by inhibition of COX-1 (12, 13). Rofecoxib is a COX-2 selective inhibitor and spares COX-1 inhibition. A pooled analysis of 8 efficacy trials in osteoarthritis and a large prospective study of outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis showed that rofecoxib maintained efficacy and resulted in a significantly lower incidence of serious GI toxicity compared with nonspecific dual COX inhibitors (14, 15). We prospectively compared rofecoxib and a dual COX-inhibiting NSAID (naproxen) in relatively unselected patients with characteristics typical of persons seen in clinical practice. Our study sample included elderly patients with comorbid conditions. Forty-nine percent had hypertension, 60% had a history of cardiovascular events, and 47% had a history of GI events, including previous discontinuation of therapy with arthritis medication because of GI symptoms (15%). Methods Study Sample Physicians predominantly at primary care practices associated with investigational sites recruited patients from their existing practices or recruited new patients presenting with osteoarthritis who were screened for study participation. Patients were at least 40 years of age and had osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, hand, or spine that had been symptomatic for more than 6 months and required regular treatment with an NSAID or acetaminophen. Osteoarthritis was classified as American College of Rheumatology functional class I, II, or III. Patients were excluded if, in the opinion of the investigator, they had a potentially confounding concurrent disease. Patients were not excluded because of a history of dyspepsia, ulcer, GI bleeding, or other GI symptoms besides history of malabsorption as long as they did not have a history of sustained use (>4 consecutive days) of GI protective medications such as H2-blockers, antacids, and proton-pump inhibitors during the month before study entry. Low-dose aspirin ( 100 mg/d) was allowed if it had been taken for cardiovascular prophylaxis before randomization. Study Design We enrolled 5557 patients at 600 study sites, 581 in the United States and 19 in Sweden. At the baseline visit, written informed consent and medical history were obtained and eligible patients underwent physical examination. Baseline laboratory tests included complete blood count, serum chemistry studies, and urinalysis. In addition, at baseline, patients completed a Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS) questionnaire, which is a 0- to 100-mm visual analogue scale, and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey, which measured quality of life. Patients who primarily had osteoarthritis of the hand completed the Australian/Canadian (AUSCAN) Osteoarthritis Hand Index (16). Following an initial overview of the questionnaires with study staff, patients completed all efficacy questions without assistance from site personnel. A computer-generated randomization schedule was used to assign eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, or naproxen, 500 mg twice daily. Allocation was balanced by study site. To maintain blinding, patients took rofecoxib plus a naproxen placebo or naproxen plus a rofecoxib placebo in the morning and naproxen or naproxen placebo in the evening. Acetaminophen ( 2600 mg/d) was available to all patients as needed during the study as rescue medication for intolerable pain. Patients were also permitted to use concomitant GI protective medications during the trial (including proton-pump inhibitors, antacids, and H2-blockers) if needed to treat GI symptoms. Investigational site staff contacted patients by telephone for collection of safety data at weeks 3 and 9 of therapy. At week 6 and week 12 (or discontinuation), patients returned to the office and were questioned by a clinical investigator about adverse events and changes in medical therapy since the last visit. A physical examination was performed, vital signs were recorded, and patients completed the PGADS questionnaire. The investigator identified adverse events on the basis of physical examination of the patient and patient-reported adverse events; he or she also evaluated adverse events for severity and determined causality. Study medication, adherence, and rescue acetaminophen use were recorded. At week 12 (or discontinuation), a physical examination was performed; patients completed the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey; and complete blood count, serum chemistry studies, and urinalysis were done. Patients with hand osteoarthritis completed the AUSCAN Osteoarthritis Hand Index. Adherence was assessed by measuring pill count (doses taken compared with doses scheduled) during study site visits at weeks 6 and 12. The investigators were instructed to report all laboratory and clinical adverse events that occurred during treatment and within 14 days of discontinuation of therapy with the study drug. Patients were instructed to contact an investigator if they wanted to discontinue treatment. An investigator could recommend that a patient discontinue treatment because of clinical or laboratory assessments. Ethical Considerations The study was conducted with consideration for the protection of patients, as outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards or ethical review committees. All patients gave written informed consent before undergoing any examination or study procedure. Statistical Analysis All analyses were prespecified in the protocol and detailed in the data analysis plan. The primary end point, GI tolerability, was defined as discontinuation due to GI adverse events or abdominal pain during the 12-week treatment period. The primary time point or exposure period was defined as end of study, that is, from the time of the first dose up to 14 days after the 12-week visit (day 98) or discontinuation. For time-to-event data, the log-rank test was used to compare the cumulative incidence curves for discontinuation due to GI adverse events. The Cox proportional-hazards model with treatment as a factor was used to estimate relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% CIs for rofecoxib compared with naproxen. Similar analyses were conducted for any concomitant use of GI medications during the trial. Incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events was tabulated by treatment group. Additional tabulations were prepared for serious adverse events, drug-related adverse events, and adverse events that resulted in study withdrawal. To determine the incidence of perforations, ulcers, bleeding, and cardiovascular events, two expert external committees (GI and cardiovascular) evaluated blinded data obtained from patients suspected of having an event that required adjudication, according to previously described criteria (17). A Cox proportional-hazards model with treatment effect as a factor was used to estimate RRs and corresponding CIs for perforations, ulcers, bleeding, or cardiovascular events in the rofecoxib group compared with the naproxen group. The Fisher exact test was used to compare incidence of confirmed perforations, ulcers, bleeding, thrombotic events, and cardiovascular events according to Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration criteria (17). Summaries were prepared for all other safety variables. The PGADS questionnaire was measured on a 0- to 100-mm visual analogue scale and was evaluated at baseline, week 6, and week 12. The analysis of PGADS applied a last-observation-carried-forward approach in which missing data at week 12 were imputed by data from week 6. Missing baseline and week 6 data were not imputed. For each efficacy evaluation, differences in treatment means and corresponding CIs were estimated fr", "outbound_citations": ["12416788", "12039807", "12086296", "11866677", "11792343", "11275626", "11087881", "11156493", "11115219", "11041909", "10980759", "10979111", "10871971", "10782831", "10752019", "10580458", "10383505", "9596549", "9572317", "9597150", "9561120", "8898449", "7610990", "8159730", "8298418", "8265610", "8210577", "8454631", "1464605", "12473274", "1834002", "2642452"], "inbound_citations": ["30536757", "30055077", "30096840", "29251608", "28698825", "27659504", "28019014", "27608487", "27534608", "26525846", "25827797", "25539845", "25342992"], "label": "1"}

'Non-cases' were all reports of reactions other than these being studied. Amineptine and acetaminophen were used as 'positive controls'. Among the 42,913 adverse drug reactions recorded in the database between January 1995 and December 1997, 5708 (13 per cent) were liver injuries. In comparison with other drugs in the database, liver injuries were inversely associated with exposure to NSAIDs, whatever the class of the drugs (OR 0.3 [0.3-0.4]). In contrast, liver injuries were significantly related to acetaminophen (OR 2.1 [1.9-2.3]), and amineptine (OR 14.0 [10.5-18.7]). Naproxen and diclofenac were associated with a higher frequency of liver injuries, respectively 15.7 per cent and 11.5 per cent. The risk associated with NSAIDs alone significantly decreased when the analysis was performed after exclusion of hepatotoxic drugs associated with NSAIDs (except for naproxen). The present results show the low frequency of liver damage associated with NSAIDs.

Conventional treatment for these debilitating conditions routinely involves the use of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are nonspecific inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2. Numerous studies suggest that inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by NSAIDs is deleterious to kidney function, particularly in high-risk patients. As celecoxib inhibits COX-2 and spares COX-1 at therapeutic doses, we hypothesized that it may offer an improved renal safety profile in patients at risk for NSAID-induced renal toxicity. This article represents a post hoc analysis of the renal safety of celecoxib, using the safety database generated during its clinical development program. This analysis includes data from more than 50 clinical studies involving more than 13,000 subjects. Most subjects were enrolled in randomized, controlled trials (of up to 12 weeks' duration); however, more than 5000 subjects received celecoxib for as long as 2 years in a long-term, open-label study at as much as twice the maximum recommended dosage. The overall incidence of renal adverse events after celecoxib was greater than that after placebo but similar to that after NSAIDs. The most common events reported after celecoxib, namely, peripheral edema (2.1%), hypertension (0.8%), and exacerbation of preexisting hypertension (0.6%), were not time- or dose-related. Peripheral edema was not associated with increased weight or blood pressure. Furthermore, there was no evidence of drug-drug interactions between celecoxib and concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics. We conclude that celecoxib is well tolerated by patients who may be at risk for NSAID-induced renal toxicity, such as the elderly and those with hypertension or preexisting chronic heart disease.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35234840", "33245277", "32912981", "30519048", "29202670", "28764659", "28274156", "27814606", "27317936", "27253415", "26940257", "27000064", "25020203"], "label": "1"}

We assessed whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective NSAID naproxen among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 8076 patients who were at least 50 years of age (or at least 40 years of age and receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid arthritis to receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg of naproxen twice daily. The primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers).\n\n\nRESULTS\nRofecoxib and naproxen had similar efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months, 2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective rates of complicated confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and 1.4 per 100 patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8; P=0.005). The incidence of myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the naproxen group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs. 0.4 percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.7); the overall mortality rate and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes were similar in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper gastrointestinal events than treatment with naproxen, a nonselective inhibitor.", "outbound_citations": ["11028250", "10979111", "10871971", "10817549", "10693877", "10609815", "10580457", "10580458", "10555907", "10566565", "10500058", "10369853", "9596549", "9558445", "8687261", "8803564", "7611589", "8265610", "8375421", "8454631", "6639693"], "inbound_citations": ["37093356", "37153279", "36797236", "36424024", "36792039", "36675454", "36500502", "36198050", "36270473", "36175343", "36151393", "36057770", "36058148", "36031811", "36741433", "35779690", "35677432", "35585779", "35572190", "35234840", "35339101", "35600275", "35163356", "35187113", "34808133", "34767851", "34668591", "34642179", "34334792", "34255857", "34305919", "34232837", "34198968", "34234675", "33876393", "33837224", "33213769", "33376011", "33305585", "33288857", "33191311", "33272872", "33169534", "33156907", "33234913", "33110169", "33085015", "33190014", "33142429", "32998383", "32969360", "32937079", "32921269", "32932669", "32858871", "32903591", "32785485", "32848762", "32821151", "32731769", "32653589", "32540483", "32771085", "32427079", "32791982", "32754470", "32322101", "32251635", "32282738", "32279725", "32610747", "32111102", "32115046", "31957506", "31977923", "31937550", "31935033", "31943085", "31916080", "32154149", "34305336", "32894506", "31088130", "31629819", "31889729", "31851037", "31404942", "31785384", "31445233", "31553935", "31551825", "31480335", "31406189", "31122736", "31359235", "31357612", "31339385", "31040441", "30981577", "30835963", "30484960", "31068805", "30999962", "30477749", "30345927", "29485681", "30900061", "30830923", "30884758", "32431393", "30813156", "30628139", "30820123", "30666154", "30641973", "30223247", "30552656", "30536757", "30383903", "30204233", "29939099", "29468666", "30658157", "31451211", "30607467", "30564910", "29993259", "29964214", "29525238", "30439866", "30479459", "30362840", "30613611", "30383755", "29727003", "30706039", "30139288", "30231067", "30136244", "30119677", "30096158", "30066292", "30021495", "30013400", "30015253", "29928007", "29874966", "29421522", "29505793", "29548675", "29747461", "29620048", "29587668", "29506541", "29421936", "29445300", "29392089", "29480591", "29295852", "29212381", "29796239", "29202670", "29239790", "30459046", "29756563", "29207335", "28819782", "29214381", "29020251", "29020288", "29201297", "28939645", "29030657", "28983850", "28695614", "29081954", "28876390", "28786378", "28378879", "28601533", "28602866", "28569554", "28658301", "28477984", "28054752", "28509650", "28062298", "27982453", "27875062", "28336160", "28019014", "28138824", "28138363", "28127041", "28067282", "27841017", "28094550", "27652576", "27859873", "27650559", "28274156", "27498352", "27652819", "28738385", "27919112", "27492900", "28216796", "27682515", "27590884", "27622453", "27575590", "27432695", "27855829", "27083387", "27608487", "27537326", "27467204", "26931292", "27474698", "27318821", "27312830", "27311100", "27105159", "26997558", "26921135", "27037270", "26970519", "26979823", "27417868", "27168132", "27533522", "26984863", "26899022", "26844536", "26980438", "26942308", "26775657", "26695395", "26166140", "26784119", "26764192", "26857105", "26408839", "26939273", "26810416", "27107994", "26701927", "26670066", "26845012", "26600291", "25956433", "26480878", "26404864", "25251373", "26539002", "26281772", "26096497", "26150361", "27011859", "26622316", "26269118", "26622385", "26225198", "26186173", "26134750", "26004029", "26142028", "25908304", "26142039", "26112345", "26129789", "26017392", "25773005", "25970845", "25950691", "26084136", "25263946", "25800393", "25796279", "25857826", "25878388", "25830062", "25492024", "25554116", "25150427", "25653559", "24351518", "25537698", "25074039", "25515365", "25572030", "25598854", "25434661", "25230166", "25499395", "25608693", "25340915", "25436616", "23088217", "25220474", "25219631", "25313347", "25133963", "25098498", "24690187", "24667227", "24628410", "25071338", "25050589", "25011568", "24887395", "24635449", "24623474", "24931511", "24480048", "24102791"], "label": "1"}

Methods: A 6-month prospective study involving 562 OA patients enrolled at 29 Spanish primary-care centres. Patients were continued on established tNSAID therapy for the first 3 months then switched to rofecoxib 12.5 or 25\u2009mg/day. Results: Both patients and physicians were significantly more likely to be satisfied with rofecoxib treatment than with tNSAIDs (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and assessments of overall health status improved significantly during rofecoxib therapy (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Adherence to therapy was significantly better with rofecoxib than during tNSAID treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Use of rofecoxib was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of discontinuations attributed to lack of effectiveness (p\u2009<\u20090.001) or gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (p\u2009<\u20090.001 compared with tNSAIDs). Rofecoxib was also associated with a >60% reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing a GI adverse event and a halving in the proportion of patients who received GI co-medications; concomitant analgesic use decreased by one-third during rofecoxib therapy. Conclusions: Use of rofecoxib was associated with marked improvements in several indices of treatment effectiveness and tolerability, and in patient and physician satisfaction and perception of general health status compared with tNSAIDs. Rofecoxib is a valuable additional medication for relieving the symptoms of OA and its use in place of tNSAIDs may lead to a reduction in the prescription of concomitant medications.", "outbound_citations": ["12841920", "12173280", "11754710", "12201624", "12086296", "11813933", "11589252", "11405384", "11171692", "11041909", "10871971", "10817549", "10994564", "10555907", "2009784"], "inbound_citations": ["33548997", "26636489"], "label": "0"}

Subjects were randomly assigned to placebo, rofecoxib 25 or 50 mg followed by 25 mg every 24 hours as needed, or naproxen sodium 550 mg every 12 hours as needed for up to 3 days. Subjects took all four treatments in a balanced, complete-block, crossover design. Measurements included self-administered questionnaires of analgesic efficacy, spontaneous reports of adverse experiences, physical examinations, and laboratory safety tests. Rofecoxib 25 and 50 mg provided analgesic efficacy greater than placebo (P < or = .006) for the primary endpoint of total pain relief over the first 8 hours. For other efficacy endpoints (sum of the pain intensity difference over the first 8 hours, subject's global evaluation, peak pain relief, peak pain intensity difference, and time to remedication) both doses of rofecoxib were better than placebo (P < or = .006) and were not distinguishable from naproxen sodium for all efficacy endpoints.

The COX-2 gene is over-expressed in reflux oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus, gastric and colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatotoxicity, cirrhosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, and specific COX-2 inhibitors have been tried experimentally and clinically and found effective. A Medline search was performed of English-language experimental studies and controlled clinical trials from January 1980 to January 2002, and relevant citations were noted. Review of available literature shows that sulindac and COX-2 inhibitors are effective in preventing as well as regressing familial adenomatous polyposis. However, they have not been shown to prevent cancer in these patients. Studies evaluating NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in carcinogen-induced and genetically manipulated animal models of various cancers have been promising especially in conditions such as Barrett's oesophagus, oesophageal and hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. COX-2 inhibitors may be of value in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis, pancreatitis and hepatitis, although carefully planned randomized controlled clinical trials demonstrating their efficacy need to be conducted. At present NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors cannot be recommended for average-risk individuals or for those with sporadic colorectal neoplasia (or other forms of cancers) as chemo-preventive agents. COX-2 inhibitors may open up a new therapeutic era in which these drugs can be used for chemo-prophylaxis. However, COX-2 selective inhibitors retain renal adverse effects of the non-selective inhibitors and the concern regarding the pro-thrombotic potential of COX-2 inhibitors will limit their value as chemo-preventive agents.", "outbound_citations": ["11330414", "12607513", "12046075", "12115513", "12010890", "11835924", "11792343", "11756685", "11735747", "11735746", "11735744", "11729118", "11606854", "11743745", "11586094", "11511527", "11448905", "29470942", "11350912", "11286478", "11304662", "11171823", "11173045", "11160126", "11223821", "11252686", "11527961", "11185674", "11087869", "11059772", "10979111", "10980113", "10950041", "10877734", "11020910", "11005569", "10925968", "10874065", "10874062", "10871971", "10817549", "11317165", "10786664", "10778945", "10702199", "10657949", "10664917", "10859997", "10606363", "10632332", "10580457", "10580458", "10555933", "10560596", "10555907", "10597402", "10471832", "10425287", "10485483", "10468690", "10473081", "10430112", "10369853", "10385625", "10390124", "10215647", "10321755", "10051469", "10327390", "10070951", "10228831", "10226539", "10555149", "10029375", "9823297", "9811310", "9809985", "9766645", "9731479", "9783758", "9783757", "9679035", "9679948", "9556464", "9521170", "9488582", "9458081", "9399940", "9353183", "9439674", "9336110", "9815550", "9303370", "9262254", "9230200", "9140046", "9102213", "9065401", "9065402", "9024292", "8995303", "8959316", "8938184", "8903327", "8653697", "8632912", "8898449", "8531950", "8521479", "7592593", "8630885", "7657130", "7641194", "7606732", "7780968", "7767971", "7698600", "7708772", "8538196", "7926468", "7920212", "8172988", "8117171", "8299902", "8298943", "8339210", "8331682", "8385741", "8384235", "8420281", "1560809", "1650315", "1892140", "1712772", "2012355", "2120205", "2311181", "2513898", "2535920", "3731036", "3458943", "6509432", "6583454", "7471122"], "inbound_citations": ["35782818"], "label": "0"}

The limit of quantification was 10 ng x ml(-1), the intra-batch precision was 6.3, 2.1 and 2.1% and the intra-batch accuracy was 3.2, 0.3 and 0.1% for 30, 300 and 1200 ng x ml(-1) respectively. The inter-batch precision was 2.3, 2.8 and 2.7% and the accuracy was 3.3, 0.3 and 0.1% for 30, 300 and 1200 ng x ml(-1) respectively. This method was employed in a bioequivalence study of one nimesulide drop formulation (nimesulide 50 mg x ml(-1) drop, Medley S/A Ind\u00fastria Farmac\u00eautica, Brazil) against one standard nimesulide drop formulation (Nisulid, 50 mg x ml(-1) drop, Astra M\u00e9dica, Brazil). Twenty-four healthy volunteers (both sexes) took part in the study and received a single oral dose of nimesulide (100 mg, equivalent to 2 ml of either formulation) in an open, randomized, two-period crossover way, with a 2-week washout interval between periods. The 90% confidence interval (CI) for geometric mean ratios between nimesulide and Nisulid were 93.1-109.6% for C(max), 87.7-99.8% for AUC(last) and 88.1-99.7% for AUC(0-infinity). Since the 90% CI for the above-mentioned parameters were included in the 80-125% interval proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration, the two formulations were considered bioequivalent in terms of both rate and extent of absorption.", "outbound_citations": ["11114083", "10360444", "10080658", "9427063"], "inbound_citations": ["36005622", "30696255", "27284972"], "label": "0"}

Probability estimates were derived from detailed data of 2 randomized trials and a systematic search of the medical literature. Utility estimates were obtained from 60 randomly selected members of the general public. Cost estimates were obtained from Canadian provincial databases. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for patients at average risk of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) events and for high-risk patients with a prior history of a UGI event. Subjects were patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where a decision has been made to treat with NSAIDs but who do not require low-dose aspirin. Main outcome measures were proportion of patients with clinical or complicated UGI events, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and life expectancy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEvaluation of rofecoxib versus naproxen in patients with RA at average risk resulted in costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $Can271,188. Celecoxib was dominated by diclofenac in average-risk patients. Both rofecoxib and celecoxib are cost-effective in high-risk patients.

H. pylori infection for 4 and 12 weeks caused moderate and severe gastritis, respectively, with cyclooxygenase-2 expression and an increase in prostaglandin E(2) production. In normal animals, gastric injury was caused by indomethacin, but not by NS-398. At 4 weeks infection, gastric lesions were synergistically aggravated by indomethacin, and NS-398 at high doses. However, at 12 weeks, the synergistic effects of indomethacin and NS-398 with H. pylori were not observed.

It has been suggested that as much as 38% of the elderly population would meet criteria for MCI and although the associated memory deficits are mild, the fact that up to 15% of MCI patients, particularly those with a particular type of memory impairment, convert to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) annually has prompted serious attention. Despite the high conversion rate, MCI cannot be used synonymously with early or mild AD, as patients with AD are impaired not only in memory performance but in other cognitive domains as well; they meet diagnostic criteria for dementia. However, since there is a high conversion rate from MCI to AD, it is likely many with MCI have the underlying neuropathology of AD, though they do not yet meet clinical diagnostic criteria. Therefore, treatment strategies developed for AD, specifically acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and Cox-2 inhibitors, have been among the first employed to treat MCI. It is hoped that by impeding the progression of MCI in this manner, fewer patients will convert to AD.

Two studies with identical protocols assessed the single- and multiple-dose analgesic efficacy and tolerability of celecoxib, a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, in the treatment of acute pain after orthopedic surgery. These were multicenter, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trials conducted between January and June 1998. Both consisted of a single-dose assessment period (SDAP) and a multiple-dose assessment period (MDAP). In the SDAP, patients who had undergone orthopedic surgery received a single oral dose of celecoxib 200 mg, hydrocodone 10 mg/acetaminophen 1000 mg, or placebo within 24 hours after the end of anesthesia, with pain assessments conducted over the following 8-hour period. In the MDAP, extending from 8 hours after the first dose of study medication up to 5 days, patients who had received < or =1 dose of rescue medication during the SDAP continued on study medication (placebo recipients were rerandomized to active treatment), which could be taken up to 3 times a day as needed. A total of 418 patients were enrolled in the 2 trials. During the SDAP, 141 patients received celecoxib, 136 received hydrocodone/acetaminophen, and 141 received placebo. During the MDAP, 185 patients received celecoxib and 181 received hydrocodone/acetaminophen. When the combined data were analyzed, mean pain intensity difference (PID) scores generally favored the active treatments over placebo from 1 to 6 hours (with the exception of 1.5 hours) after dosing (P < or = 0.016) and favored celecoxib over the other treatments at 7 and 8 hours after dosing (P < 0.001). The active treatments demonstrated superior summed PID scores through 8 hours (P < 0.001), significantly shorter median times to onset of analgesia (P < 0.05), and significantly longer median times to first use of rescue medication (P < 0.05). During the MDAP, more hydrocodone/acetaminophen-treated patients (20%) than celecoxib-treated patients (12%) required rescue medication (P < 0.05), and the celecoxib group had significantly lower maximum pain intensity scores (P < 0.001, days 2-5), required fewer doses of study medication (P < or = 0.01, days 3-5), and had superior scores on a modified American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire (P < or = 0.013). In addition, a significantly lower proportion of celecoxib-treated patients experienced adverse events (43%) compared with hydrocodone/acetaminophen-treated patients (89%; P < 0.001). Over 8 hours, patients with moderate to severe pain after orthopedic surgery experienced comparable analgesia with single doses of celecoxib and hydrocodone/acetaminophen. Over a 5-day period, oral doses of celecoxib 200 mg taken 3 times a day demonstrated superior analgesia and tolerability compared with hydrocodone 10 mg/acetaminophen 1000 mg taken 3 times a day. Most patients required no more than 2 daily doses of celecoxib 200 mg for the control of their postorthopedic surgical pain.", "outbound_citations": ["11304658", "10955327", "10925968", "10826459", "11317165", "19078452", "10664917", "10580457", "10560596", "9715832", "9598258", "9322460", "9135032", "8636625", "8959196", "7500539", "8357002", "7137610", "7053264", "5284360"], "inbound_citations": ["37085034", "35949389", "35717988", "34977658", "34434475", "33796593", "33615243", "34285886", "33062524", "32200065", "32754705", "31851037", "31764672", "31604491", "31072715", "31047126", "29569951", "30733030", "30364866", "30160247", "29913027", "29553279", "29253346", "29274661", "28727706", "28343643", "28231966", "27271789", "26929661", "26683233", "26827847", "26003773", "25797973", "25415660"], "label": "0"}

This study tested whether nabumetone has effects different from those of indomethacin on exercise-induced changes in renal function and the renin-aldosterone system. In a randomized fashion, ten subjects were studied after indomethacin (100 mg), nabumetone (1 g) or no medication (control) administered orally at 22.00 hours on the day before each study day, and again at 8.00 hours upon arrival at the laboratory. Renal function was studied at baseline, during graded 20-min exercise sessions at 25%, 50% and 75% of the maximal oxygen uptake rate, and subsequently during two 1-h recovery periods. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and plasma catecholamines at rest and during exercise were not altered by indomethacin or nabumetone. Indomethacin decreased urinary rates of excretion of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F(1alpha) (6-oxo-PGF(1alpha)) and thromboxane B(2) in all study periods. Nabumetone decreased 6-oxo-PGF(1alpha) excretion during and after exercise. Excretion rates for PGE(2) did not change. Neither indomethacin nor nabumetone changed baseline values or exercise-induced decreases in renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate. Indomethacin, but not nabumetone, decreased sodium excretion, urine flow rate and free water clearance. The renal response to exercise, however, remained unchanged. In contrast with nabumatone, indomethacin decreased the plasma renin concentration. Thus, during exercise, nabumetone may decrease the excretion of 6-oxo-PGF(1alpha) by inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-1 or by inhibition of specific exercise-induced activation of cyclo-oxygenase-2, or both. None of the drugs changed the renal response to exercise.

AIMS We compared the biochemical and gastrointestinal effects of nimesulide, a potent and selective COX-2 inhibitor, with naproxen which exhibits no selectivity. SUBJECTS Thirty six healthy volunteers were randomised to nimesulide 100 mg or naproxen 500 mg twice daily for two weeks in a double blind, crossover study with a washout between treatments. METHODS Gastrointestinal side effects were assessed by endoscopy, and by estimation of small intestinal absorption-permeability and inflammation. Comparisons were made between variables at the end of each treatment phase. RESULTS Nimesulide caused significantly less gastric injury using the modified Lanza score (p<0.001) as well as reduced duodenum injury (p=0.039). Nimesulide had lower visual analogue scores (VAS) for haemorrhage and erosive lesions in the stomach (p<0.001) and for mucosal injection in the duodenum (p=0.039). Naproxen increased excretion of calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation (5.5 (1.2) to 12.1 (2.1) mg/l) while nimesulide had no effect (treatment difference p=0.03). Naproxen abolished platelet aggregation to arachidonic acid and suppressed serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) by 98%, indices of COX-1 activity. In contrast, nimesulide had no significant effect on platelet aggregation, although it reduced serum TXB2 by 29%. Production of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin by gastric biopsies, also COX-1 dependent, was inhibited by naproxen, but not by nimesulide. COX-2 activity, determined as endotoxin induced prostaglandin E2 formation in plasma, was markedly suppressed by both treatments. INTERPRETATION Nimesulide has preferential selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1 in vivo at full therapeutic doses and induces less gastrointestinal damage than that seen with naproxen in the short term.", "outbound_citations": ["10693877", "10580457", "10348815", "9874808", "9808683", "9824578", "9649464", "9402773", "9391242", "9171872", "9051872", "8827022", "8949635", "8690211", "8726300", "8521478", "8581280", "7562530", "7611589", "7729650", "7991575", "7965814", "8053430", "8159730", "7510883", "8220939", "8215426", "8500743", "8473346", "8362208", "1411288", "1519577", "1594589", "2120769", "2193376", "2642450", "3345876", "2831188", "2888943", "3609658", "3596334", "2955117", "3933848", "4052129", "2409791", "20218005", "7028786", "6965646", "637512", "4556704", "9712237", "6465160", "1834002", "1568650"], "inbound_citations": ["34209869", "33716293", "33552178", "33828365", "28869827", "28599988", "28317866", "26233559"], "label": "1"}

It is therefore possible that higher doses of rofecoxib may affect platelet function. This could be important if rofecoxib is given to thrombocytopenic patients. In these cases, already moderate inhibition of platelet function could precipitate bleeding complications. We therefore set out to investigate the influence of rofecoxib on platelet function in healthy volunteers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe set up a balanced-randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two way cross-over study. Peripheral blood was withdrawn from 42 healthy volunteers before and 3 hours after intake of 50, 250, 500 mg of rofecoxib or placebo (n = 14 per group). Platelet function was assessed by a platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) which measures collagen-epinephrine induced closure time (CEPI-CT) under shear stress.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCEPI-CT increased by 14% (p = 0.002) and 11% (p = 0.003) three hours after intake of placebo and rofecoxib at dosages of up to 500 mg, respectively.

This study compared the incidence of endoscopically detected gastroduodenal ulcers in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with rofecoxib or a non-selective NSAID. Methods: In this multicentre, randomised, double blind, 12 week study, patients with rheumatoid arthritis were allocated to rofecoxib 50 mg once daily (n=219), naproxen 500 mg twice daily (n=220), or placebo (n=221). Endoscopy was performed at baseline and at six and 12 weeks. Lifetable analysis and log rank tests were used to analyse the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers \u22653 mm. Gastric or duodenal ulcers \u22655 mm and erosions were also evaluated as secondary end points. Tolerability was assessed by adverse events. Results: The cumulative incidence of ulcers \u22653 mm at 12 weeks was significantly higher in patients on naproxen (25.5%) than in patients receiving rofecoxib (6.8%; difference 18.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.7%, 25.7%); p<0.001) or placebo (2.9%; difference 22.6% (95% CI 16.1%, 29.1%); p<0.001). The difference between rofecoxib (6.8%) and placebo (2.9%) did not reach statistical significance (p=0.066). Results were similar for ulcers \u22655 mm and for mean changes from baseline in the number of gastroduodenal erosions. The overall incidence of clinical adverse events was similar among treatment groups (61% of patients on placebo, 62% in patients on rofecoxib, and 66% in patients on naproxen). Conclusions: Rofecoxib 50 mg daily (twice the dose recommended for this patient population) resulted in a lower incidence of endoscopically detected gastroduodenal ulcers and erosions than treatment with naproxen 500 mg twice daily.", "outbound_citations": ["2901397", "14657426", "14657315", "14638357", "12870732", "12801972", "12671882", "12657935", "12683873", "12671887", "12516030", "12490472", "12761724", "12586304", "12235079", "12130426", "12024119", "11873099", "11872049", "11878299", "11859032", "12059051", "11743252", "11941952", "11315901", "11718587", "11563999", "11693340", "11489912", "11403809", "11172334", "11136272", "11529651", "11087881", "11115219", "10986213", "11036286", "10974182", "10871971", "10817549", "10796907", "10770302", "10746728", "10733316", "10716154", "10693877", "10904926", "11077658", "10904925", "10580458", "10580584", "10566732", "10577093", "10511349", "10482429", "10383505", "10205204", "10096266", "10566731", "9609215", "9263345", "9302367", "9178711", "9020274", "9108615", "7611589", "7577004", "7761808", "7698687", "7890235", "7991575", "7922996", "7531643", "8159730", "8121485", "8247072", "8282253", "8328732", "1834002", "1902217", "2038014", "1987872", "2758387", "3324305", "3297204", "6378441", "6993671", "299896", "10369853", "PMC1728068", "10500058", "PMC45366", "PMC43549", "PMC1382439"], "inbound_citations": ["33191311", "32969360", "28748412", "25757007", "25246044"], "label": "1"}

Plasma concentrations of meloxicam were determined by validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. The pharmaco-kinetic profile of meloxicam is characterized by almost complete absorption over a prolonged phase-avoiding high initial drug concentrations- and is bound to plasma proteins by more than 99.5%. Meloxicam is metabolized to four biologically inactive metabolites and excreted in urine and faeces with an elimination half-life (t1/2) of around 20 h. This is reflected in a total plasma clearance of 7 to 8 ml/min. Steady state is achieved within 3 to 5 days. In addition, the pharmacokinetic parameters are linear over the entire dose range, there are no changes with multiple dosing and bioequivalence was shown for a number of different formulations.

Thereafter, patients received either 15 mg meloxicam plus 40 mg frusemide day(-1), or one placebo tablet plus 40 mg frusemide day(-1) for 7 days.

Intravenous morphine, 4 mg, was studied as a positive analgesic control. Methods In this multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, women experiencing moderate-to-severe pain on the first day after abdominal hysterectomy or myomectomy received one intravenous dose of parecoxib sodium, 20 or 40 mg, ketorolac, 30 mg, morphine, 4 mg, or placebo. Analgesic efficacy and tolerability were evaluated for 24 h postdose or until patients, whose pain was not adequately controlled, opted to receive rescue analgesia. Results Two hundred two patients were enrolled. All treatment groups had comparable demographics and baseline pain status. All active treatments had an equally rapid time to onset of analgesia (10\u201323 min). Overall, each parecoxib sodium dose and ketorolac were significantly superior to morphine and placebo for most measures of analgesic efficacy at most time points, including a significantly longer (two- to threefold) time to rescue analgesia (P \u2264 0.05). All treatments were well tolerated. Conclusions Single intravenous doses of parecoxib sodium, 20 mg and 40 mg, have comparable analgesic effects and are well tolerated after laparotomy surgery.

The hydroalcoholic extract and it's fractions (aqueous and ethanolic) inhibited carrageenan-induced edema. However, only the ethanolic fraction was used in the other experiments due to it's yield. The extract also inhibited the cotton pellet granuloma and the increase of vascular permeability induced by histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and prostaglandin E2, but not that produced by bradykinin. The extract or the fraction did not present analgesic activity in the writhing test using acetic acid and did not reduce croton oil-induced ear edema in mice. When the ethanolic fraction and LPS were administered i.p. to Balb/C mice 72 h before blood or peritoneal fluid collection, no changes were observed in the white or total blood cell counts in the peripheral blood. On the other hand, changes were observed in both total and differential cell counts in the peritoneal exudate since all doses of the fraction reduced the number of total leukocytes (mainly lymphocytes) obtained from the peritoneal exudate. In contrast to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the administration of the hydroalcoholic extract or the ethanolic fraction alone did not potentiate gastric mucosal lesions induced by aspirin. The extract and the fraction inhibited the appearance of gastric lesions induced by indomethacin, ethanol and pylorus ligature, but not those induced by stress. As also observed with carbenoxolone, the ethanolic fraction increased the wall mucus in hypothermical-restraint stress-induced gastric lesions. The anti-ulcerogenic effect of the extract and of the ethanolic fraction may be related to an increase of mucosal defensive factors, such as prostaglandin and mucus. The anti-inflammatory actions of the extract and the fraction may be due to an inhibitory effect on histamine and cyclooxygenase II, but not on cyclooxygenase I, because the extract and it's fraction present both anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerogenic effects. The major substances present in the ethanolic fraction are flavonoids which will be isolated and identified.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36679128", "35164352", "35153134", "33359854", "30576771", "30150181", "29436586", "29378554", "28502905", "28472941", "28280516", "27544002", "29034192", "30549828", "26812486", "27548136", "27096253", "26770385", "25739325", "28911694", "25453279", "24756057", "24561028"], "label": "0"}

However, important findings such as high levels of activating cytokines in the CSF and signs of CNS inflammation have been controversial. The authors conducted a trial of the new selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib, an immunomodulatory drug, in schizophrenic patients to evaluate its therapeutic effects.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIn a prospective, double-blind evaluation, 50 patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were randomly assigned to either risperidone plus celecoxib or risperidone plus placebo. After a washout period, 25 patients received 2-6 mg/day of risperidone plus placebo and 25 received risperidone plus 400 mg/day of celecoxib for 5 weeks. The treatment effect was calculated by analysis of covariance. There were no significant differences between groups in age, sex, duration or severity of disease or psychopathology, or risperidone dose or plasma level.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver 5 weeks, both groups of patients showed significant improvement in scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and on all subscales. However, the celecoxib group showed significantly greater improvement in the total score.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdditional treatment with celecoxib has significant positive effects on the therapeutic action of risperidone with regard to total schizophrenia psychopathology. Moreover, the fact that treatment with an immunomodulatory drug showed beneficial effects on schizophrenia symptoms indicates that immune dysfunction in schizophrenia is not just an epiphenomenon but is related to the pathomechanism of the disorder. However, a nonimmunological therapeutic effect of celecoxib mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor has to be taken into account.", "outbound_citations": ["11203433", "10831492", "10773011", "10650446", "10528118", "10428420", "10200747", "9792246", "9705828", "9690329", "9690975", "9533165", "9092596", "19698539", "8789908", "8724976", "7653683", "7666381", "7766533", "7708934", "7704891", "8102512", "8352945", "3616518", "4917967"], "inbound_citations": ["37126871", "36810627", "36191804", "36636540", "36341700", "36334327", "36232626", "36148246", "36181926", "36217374", "35963926", "34995032", "35935056", "34802039", "34766870", "34547958", "33985351", "33852994", "33479775", "33176653", "33217958", "32256401", "32153436", "31958901", "32021213", "32007786", "31824351", "31445233", "31551825", "31439071", "30993607", "30219209", "31214060", "30864461", "30778328", "30766494", "31138893", "30364161", "30216787", "30218782", "29648618", "29995356", "29937710", "29742478", "29424804", "28093569", "29892311", "29197507", "29084087", "29626336", "29668471", "29284800", "29090685", "29181395", "28445800", "28851055", "28409660", "27782767", "27839914", "28456928", "28418288", "28566947", "27543496", "28560257", "27993603", "27622678", "28738373", "28738385", "28374670", "27470381", "27181513", "27524864", "27271499", "26988274", "26954600", "26427750", "26767392", "26542836", "26472628", "27793220", "29114461", "26690116", "26343594", "25736181", "26092265", "26261884", "26330878", "25919386", "25866122", "25553408", "26359903", "24948484", "25449712", "25560300", "25385789", "23491967", "25385788", "25017614", "25429645", "25608958", "25300872", "24878170", "25133871", "24856568", "23734059", "24971013", "24803587", "24911574", "24851091"], "label": "0"}

We assessed whether celecoxib would be similar to diclofenac plus omeprazole in reducing the risk of recurrent ulcer bleeding in patients at high risk for bleeding.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied patients who used NSAIDs for arthritis and who presented with ulcer bleeding. After their ulcers had healed, we randomly assigned patients who were negative for Helicobacter pylori to receive either 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily plus daily placebo or 75 mg of diclofenac twice daily plus 20 mg of omeprazole daily for six months. The end point was recurrent ulcer bleeding.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the intention-to-treat analysis, which included 287 patients (144 receiving celecoxib and 143 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole), recurrent ulcer bleeding occurred in 7 patients receiving celecoxib and 9 receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole. The probability of recurrent bleeding during the six-month period was 4.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 6.7) for patients who received celecoxib and 6.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.3 to 8.4) for patients who received diclofenac plus omeprazole (difference, -1.5 percentage points; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -6.8 to 3.8). Renal adverse events, including hypertension, peripheral edema, and renal failure, occurred in 24.3 percent of the patients receiving celecoxib and 30.8 percent of those receiving diclofenac plus omeprazole.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with a recent history of ulcer bleeding, treatment with celecoxib was as effective as treatment with diclofenac plus omeprazole, with respect to the prevention of recurrent bleeding. Renal toxic effects are common in high-risk patients receiving celecoxib or diclofenac plus omeprazole.", "outbound_citations": ["11802750", "11712924", "11274623", "11179238", "10979111", "10877734", "11014340", "10609815", "10580464", "10580457", "10500058", "10430112", "10230829", "10225536", "9732401", "9024292", "7611589", "7481195", "7907735", "8328732", "1834002", "831755", "795448"], "inbound_citations": ["36112341", "35132561", "33649044", "33407172", "32926346", "32503692", "32105355", "31937550", "31865463", "31339385", "31406516", "30477749", "30996860", "30632013", "30631366", "30361444", "30023927", "29691276", "28410791", "28597983", "27521989", "27476707", "27121479", "27019010", "26906248", "26806184", "26524151", "26558151", "26281772", "26142039", "25823424", "25857826", "25433956"], "label": "1"}

The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of meloxicam under natural prescribing conditions for up to 6 months. This was a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study. Participating centers were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: the meloxicam-only group, and the group who received comparator NSAIDs (ie, diclofenac, ibuprofen, piroxicam, or indomethacin). A total of 4526 patients received either meloxicam (n = 2530) or a comparator NSAID (n = 1996). Treatment groups were comparable in terms of observed efficacy measures. Meloxicam patients had significantly lower rates of reported gastrointestinal (GI) adverse drug reactions (1.80% vs 3.20%; P = 0.003), including dyspepsia (0.08% vs 0.35%; P = 0.049), abdominal pain (0.91% vs 1.90%; P = 0.006), gastritis (0.08% vs 0.60%; P = 0.002), and GI bleeding (0.08% vs 0.50%; P = 0.007), compared with those receiving comparator NSAIDs. There was evidence that meloxicam was prescribed preferentially to patients who had not responded to NSAIDs previously, who had previously experienced NSAID-induced side effects (and so were at high risk for developing NSAID-induced GI toxicity), or who were more seriously impaired. The nonrandomized and unblinded nature of this study limits the conclusions that can be drawn concerning efficacy or tolerability.

Drugs known to prolong the QT interval include cardiovascular as well as noncardiovascular medications such as histamine H1-receptor antagonists, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and macrolides.1 The common mechanism by which these drugs alter the QT interval is through their effect on potassium ion channels2. They reduce the outward repolarizing current and prolong the action potential duration and the QT interval. This prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) can lead to torsade de pointes (TdP). The risk of drug-induced TdP raises the question of early detection of abnormal ventricular repolarization. Celecoxib was introduced as a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) in Europe in 1999\u20132000 (in France, winter 2000) and is widely used today. Its most common adverse drug reactions are peripheral edema, salt retention, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, headache, insomnia, or fainting sensation.3 We report 3 cases of TdP with celecoxib. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of TdP in patients receiving celecoxib. Case 1. A 76-year-old white woman was given celecoxib for arthrosis. She had familial and personal history of long QT syndrome, and thus was taking a \u03b2-blocker (propranolol 160 mg/d) and had a dual-chamber pacemaker implanted in 1999 to prevent any cardiac arrhythmias (i.e., ventricular arrhythmias evident as TdP). Since 1999, she had not presented with any significant event (i.e., TdP, hospital admission for syncope, ventricular arrhythmias) and was not taking any concurrent medications. Three days after starting celecoxib 100 mg/d, this patient presented with syncope leading to direct admission to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU), where syncope recurred concomitantly with TdP. After discontinuation of celecoxib (the last dose received was prior to admission), TdP disappeared. In this case, ECG findings were related to the presence of a known familial long QT syndrome. Measurement of the QT interval showed a duration of 680 ms, thus prolonged when compared with the corrected QT value (QTc) of 440 ms in relation with heart rate. After TdP occurrence, the pacemaker\u2019s rate was controlled to normalize QT length. Her previous treatment, except for celecoxib, was restarted, and arrhythmia or cardiac symptoms did not recur during a 2-month follow-up period. According to the Naranjo probability scale,4 the likelihood that celecoxib caused the adverse reaction was rated as possible. Case 2. A 43-year-old white man was hospitalized for 2 recurrent episodes of syncope. The patient\u2019s past medical history included mild, untreated hypertension, asymptomatic ventricular premature beats investigated in 1999 with negative checkup results, and glaucoma treated with intraocular timolol. Just before admission, he had acute rhinitis treated with cetirizine (an H1-receptor antagonist), acetaminophen, inhaled dexamethasone, and inhaled framycetin and polymyxin B; concomitant joint pain was treated with transdermic ketoprofen and celecoxib 200 mg/d, started 4 days before TdP occurred. In the CICU, he presented with repeated symptomatic episodes of sustained TdP requiring numerous external cardioversions secondary to pacing and isoprenaline infusion. After discontinuation of celecoxib the day of admission (the last dose was prior to admission), TdP disappeared and did not recur during a follow-up after 4 months. In this case, QTc was 360 ms, length of QT interval before TdP was 480 ms and 370 ms after TdP. The likelihood of celecoxib causing the adverse reaction was judged as possible.4 Case 3. An 81-year-old white woman, with no past medical history and no drug treatment, was started on celecoxib 200 mg/d for arthrosis. Three days later, she was hospitalized for sinus bradycardia. The 24-hour Holter ECG recording revealed the presence of intermittent long QT syndrome with short runs of TdP (QTc 420 ms, QT interval 500 ms). These ventricular arrhythmias were asymptomatic. Celecoxib was discontinued 3 days after admission. A 24-hour ECG recorded 1 week later showed intermittent long QT syndrome (QT interval 500 ms intermittently); however, TdP was no longer present. On the Naranjo scale4 celecoxib was determined as the possible cause for the adverse reaction. No recurrence of TdP was reported after 1-month follow-up. Discussion. These 3 cases suggest a possible relationship between celecoxib and TdP occurrence, since TdP was never observed in these patients before celecoxib administration and the cardiac arrhythmia did not recur after that drug was discontinued. However, concurrent factors that may contribute to TdP should also be recognized and considered. Two of these patients had symptomatic TdP requiring hospitalization in the CICU. All 3 patients had cardiac abnormalities, which might predispose them to the development of TdP: congenital long QT syndrome treated appropriately in 1 patient, benign ventricular premature beat in the second case, and intermittent long QT syndrome in the last patient. It should be stated that antiarrhythmics (\u03b2-blockers such as timolol) and second-generation histamine H1-receptor antagonists (cetirizine) are recognized causes of drug-induced long QT interval syndrome, and thus their influence could also be discussed.5 However, the last patient had no cardiac event history and did not receive any other drugs. In all cases, electrolytes were normal (data not shown). It is difficult and premature to draw conclusions about the mechanism of this potential adverse drug reaction. To our knowledge, TdP has never been reported with NSAIDs. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is known to be constitutive in various tissues (kidney, brain) and inducible in the heart.6 Moreover, nimesulide, another COX-2 inhibitor, is able to block calcium channels in human myometrial myocytes.7 Modification of electrophysiologic pattern by increasing repolarization could lead to TdP. It is premature, given the strength of evidence and the lack of information about electrophysiologic properties of celecoxib, to suggest that this problem might occur with other COX-2 inhibitors. These case reports suggest that celecoxib might possibly reveal or induce QT-related disease and should thus be used with caution in patients at high risk of developing TdP, especially when personal or familial history of long QT syndrome is known. Further pharmacodynamic and drug safety studies, both at a basic and clinical level, should be performed to understand this unexpected cardiac event.", "outbound_citations": ["11419561", "10455298", "7606309", "7736582", "7249508"], "inbound_citations": ["29372020"], "label": "0"}

However, up to now various postoperative regimens such as the routine administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were often used in combination with enamel matrix proteins. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the results might have been influenced by the effect of the postoperative medication. The aim of this randomized, controlled, blinded, clinical investigation was to determine the effect of postsurgical administration of a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor on the healing of intrabony periodontal defects following regenerative periodontal surgery with EMD. Twenty two patients, each of whom exhibited one deep intrabony defect, were randomly treated with either EMD plus a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor (test) or with EMD alone (control). The postoperative regimen consisted of oral administration of 12.5 mg rofecoxib twice daily for 14 days. The following parameters were recorded at baseline and at 6 months by the same calibrated and blinded investigator: plaque index (Pl), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), pocket depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Power analysis to determine superiority of the anti-inflammatory treatment showed that the available sample size would yield 70% power to detect a 1 mm difference. No statistical significant differences in any of the investigated parameters between the two groups were observed at baseline. The results show that, in the test group, mean PD decreased from 8.7+/-1.4 mm to 4.7+/-2.0 mm (P<0.001) and mean CAL from 9.7+/-2.0 mm to 6.5+/-2.1 mm (P<0.001). In the control group, mean PD decreased from 8.6+/-1.6 mm to 4.7+/-1.8 mm (P<0.001) and mean CAL from 9.5+/-1.6 mm to 6.5+/-2.2 mm (P<0.001). There were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the investigated parameters.

CELECOXIB, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (Celebrex, GD Searle and Co, Skokie, IL), is increasingly being used for the relief of pain and inflammation in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Elsewhere we reported on two patients with a hypersensitivity reactions after ingestion of rice are scarce (4,5). Therefore, rice is commonly regarded as hypoallergenic and is frequently included in diets for allergic patients. A 27-year-old woman without a history of atopy presented at the allergy unit because of several episodes of rhinitis with sneezing, itching of the scalp and asthma within minutes after eating meals with seafood and rice. With each episode the symptomsbecame stronger and the last reaction was accompanied by acute urticaria. Six months before the first reaction she spent several months in the Far East without experiencing any symptoms after consuming this kind of food. Skin prick tests (SPT) with a battery of common inhalant (ALK, Horsholm, Denmark) and food allergen extracts (Stallergenes, Antony Cedex, France), including different fishes, seafood and rice were all negative, however, \u2018prick\u2013prick\u2019 and scratch tests were clearly positive with \u2018native\u2019 cooked rice. SPT with rice extract from another manufacturer (Bencard) elicitedapositivewheal-and-flare reaction. The total IgE concentration was 55 kU/l, IgE specific to rice (CAP FEIA, Pharmacia)were 4.6 kU/l (CAPclass 3), to oat 1.5 kU/l (CAP class 2), to wheat 0.9 kU/l (CAP class 2), to rye 0.7 kU/l (CAPclass2), to corn0.56 kU/l (CAPclass 1), to barley 0.36 kU/l (CAP class 1), to soy, buckwheat, fish and shrimps 0, respectively. Based on the patient\u2019s history, the positive prick\u2013prick tests and presence of IgEantibodies to rice, thediagnosisof food allergy to rice was made. The patient refused an oral provocation. She was advised to avoid further rice consumption and she received an emergency kit consisting of histamines, steroids and epinephrine. Eighteen months later she experienced an allergic reaction with rhinitis and asthma after a vegetarianmeal consisting of tofu and rice, although she removed the rice from her plate. The concentration of IgE specific to rice was still increased (10.5 kU/l) (CAP class 3) while no IgE antibodies could be detected to soy. Under elimination diet the patient remained asymptomatic during two years and the level of IgE antibodies to rice dropped to 2.3 kU/l (CAP class 2). During travel in the USA she ate Chinese noodles without knowing that they were produced from rice. Immediately after ingestion of these noodles she developed generalized itching and dyspnea. After this allergic reaction the patient carefully avoided meals containing rice. Three years after the last episode IgE specific to rice has decreased strikingly to 0.5 kU/l (CAPclass 1). The SPT to native cooked rice became negative. Rice (Oryza sativa) belongs with other cultivated cereals to different tribes of the Poaceae family. As previously described (2,4), we also observed the presence of IgE specific to different cereals, but in lower concentrations than to rice. The existence of close allergenic cross-reactivity between different cereal grains has already been demonstrated by RAST inhibition studies (4,6). A 16-kDa rice protein (RP) was identified as a cross-reactive IgE binding structure that fulfilled the criterion of a major allergen (6). Recently, a 33-kDa rice allergen, designated Glb33, was identified as a novel plant glyoxalase I (7). Our patient hadnoproblemswhen eating other cereals nor she suffered from hay fever to grass pollen.A study fromJapandescribed cross-allergenicity between rice and buckwheat antigens (8), but IgEantibodies to buckwheat were not found in our patient. Musken et al. (4) found similar allergenic potency of different sorts of rice all containing allergens of low molecular weight (14.4 and 28 kDa) as detected by western blotting. In conclusion, our patient demonstrated that in anonatopic person ingested rice can produce IgE-mediated allergic reactions and therefore should be regarded as a potential cause of food allergy. The strict avoidanceoveryearsmay lead to lossof the sensitization.", "outbound_citations": ["11551246", "11390425", "11139585", "11188419", "11146365", "10887307", "10645754", "9510411", "7513507", "8250723", "1451475", "1725171"], "inbound_citations": ["24388008"], "label": "0"}

This study was conducted in order to understand the association between acute renal failure and the two COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib. A search was performed in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) to identify cases of renal failure submitted to the FDA. A MEDLINE search of the English language literature was also performed to identify published cases of renal failure associated with celecoxib and rofecoxib. One hundred twenty-two and 142 domestic US cases of celecoxib and rofecoxib-associated renal failure, respectively, were identified in the AERS database. The literature search identified 19 cases of acute renal impairment in association with celecoxib and rofecoxib. In addition, drug regulatory authorities in the UK, Canada, and Australia have received about 50 reports of renal failure with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Descriptive statistics of the AERS cases have been summarised in this report. Data from AERS and published case reports suggest that use of both these drugs is associated with renal effects similar to that of conventional nonselective NSAIDs. Physicians should be aware that serious or life-threatening renal failure has been reported in patients with normal or impaired renal function after short-term therapy with celecoxib and rofecoxib. Patients at greatest risk for renal injury are those with pre-existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and/or ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Kidney function should be monitored closely for any signs of potential renal injuries soon after initiating treatment with these agents, especially in high-risk populations. In addition, healthcare practitioners should adequately warn patients of the signs and symptoms of serious renal toxicity, and of the need for them to see their physician promptly if they occur.

Further, the higher the blood pressure, the more marked is the reduction in life expectancy [6]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide when grouped by generic categories [7], accounting for 4% to 9% of all prescriptions in developed countries [8-12]. Since 1967, their use has increased steadily, particularly among elderly persons [13]. Certain NSAIDs have been reported in randomized, controlled trials to elevate blood pressure in some previously normotensive persons with [14] and without antihypertensive therapy [15-20], in patients with mild hypertension untreated [19, 21, 22] or treated with single doses of antihypertensive agents [23, 24], and in hypertensive persons whose blood pressure had been controlled by drug therapy [21, 25-39]. However, several well-designed studies have failed to show any effect of NSAIDs on blood pressure [40-51]. In addition, many randomized studies [52-63] have attempted to compare the effect of various NSAIDs on blood pressure control with widely differing results that have been thus far inconclusive. For most of the individual trials, the estimates may have been imprecise because the sample size was insufficient. In view of the anticipated increase in the prevalence of hypertension [64] and the substantial use of NSAIDs, any potential drugdrug (NSAID-antihypertensive agent) and drug-disease (NSAID-hypertension) interactions should be fully clarified. Consequently, we did a meta-analysis of randomized trials. Our primary goal was to produce a stable estimate of the overall effect of various NSAIDs on blood pressure; our secondary aims were to evaluate possible mechanisms by which NSAID therapy may alter blood pressure and to determine potential predisposing factors for this interaction. It has been proposed that NSAIDs may alter blood pressure through the effects of prostaglandin synthesis inhibition on body weight, cardiac output, or renal function. Consequently, where provided, we have included these data in the meta-analysis. Although NSAIDs have been associated with blood pressure elevation in normotensive persons and in both treated and untreated hypertensive persons, data pertaining to studies including persons in these subgroups were also analyzed separately to determine whether differential effects occurred in various population groups. Similarly, it was uncertain whether NSAIDs interacted with antihypertensive agents from different classes in the same manner and whether different NSAIDs altered blood pressure to the same degree. Consequently, we also studied these subgroups separately. Methods We did a MEDLINE search from 1966 to 1990. We also did the following additional searches: Embase (1974 to 1990), Biosis (1969 to 1990), Diogenes (1976 to 1990), Science Citation Abstracts (1972 to 1990), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to 1990), IOWA Drug Information Service (1966 to 1990), and the Combined Health Information Database (1973 to 1990). For each search, key words relating to trial design (meta-analysis, research design, double-blind method, double-blind study, double, blind, random allocation, random, control, clinical trials) were crossed with the names of individual NSAIDs and the following terms: anti-inflammatory agents, nonsteroidal, hypertension, blood pressure. Articles reviewing the potential interaction between NSAIDs and blood pressure were selected from these searches, and their bibliographies were carefully checked for randomized trials not published elsewhere. We also reviewed textbooks on hypertension, clinical pharmacology, and NSAIDs, and checked reference lists of all randomized trials identified by any of the above means. We selected 194 articles as potentially fulfilling the entry criteria. Only 60 articles, however, described random allocation of one or more NSAIDs and measurement of the effect of NSAIDs on blood pressure. Of the 60 articles, 38 included randomized and controlled trials [14-51] (Appendix Tables 1 and 2). Twelve more articles [52-63] were reports of randomized but not placebo-controlled studies; in these studies, two or more NSAIDs were compared with each other rather than with placebo in terms of their effects on blood pressure control. The remaining 10 articles [65-74] could not be included: eight articles [65-72] because they did not provide measures of variance for the blood pressure data such as standard error or standard deviation, which was needed for our analysis; one article [73] because no blood pressure data were provided; and one article [74] because blood pressure measurement was not the primary goal of the study and because uncontrolled administration of morphine in that trial probably confounded blood pressure levels. The eight articles that did not provide variance data for the blood pressure measurements [65-72] and the article in which blood pressure data were not provided [73] were similar to the 50 articles included in the meta-analysis with respect to patient characteristics, relevant diagnoses, and treatment received. In addition, like the included trials, reporting of an effect of NSAIDs on blood pressure was inconsistent among these articles. However, many were completed several years ago, reducing the possibility of obtaining accurate, reliable data from the original authors; most were abstracts [66, 67, 69, 70, 73], and none had a large sample size with adequate follow-up. Consequently, we considered it appropriate to exclude these studies. Control and Measurement of Potential Bias To minimize selection bias, the Clinical Trials Coordinator coded the methods and results of articles that potentially fulfilled the entry criteria for the meta-analysis. The relevant methods and results sections were photocopied after any identifying information was blacked out. The decision to accept or reject articles was made by two authors, based on the methods alone without any knowledge of the source of the articles (authors or institution) and achieved by consensus. The same two authors subsequently developed an algorithm for assessing the methodologic rigor and scientific quality of the articles to be pooled and for calculating quality assessment scores (0 to 100 [the higher the score, the better the quality of the study assessed]), using only the methods and results sections. This algorithm was broadly based on a systematic evaluation of study quality published by Chalmers and colleagues [75]. Quality assessment scores by the two assessors highly correlated (r = 0.9), suggesting close interobserver agreement. In an attempt to control data-extraction bias, relevant data were drawn from papers by the assessors, who were blinded to all but the results sections, and in 89% of studies evaluated agreement in the data extracted was complete. One author provided a quality assessment score for all trials and extracted data from every trial included in the meta-analysis, whereas the other author reviewed a 20% random selection for quality assessment scoring and another 20% random selection for extraction of data. Appendix Tables 1 and 2 present the relevant features of all randomized, controlled trials with a placebo group. Table 1 provides details of patients at trial entry (age, sex, race) and key study features (sample size, percent dropouts, design, quality assessment score, geographic location, and source of support). Appendix Table 4 outlines the treatment received by patients in each trial (including diet, NSAID type and duration of use, and antihypertensive type and duration), and the average difference (in mm Hg) between mean blood pressure recorded on NSAID treatment and control treatment, respectively, adjusted for baseline mean blood pressure ([NSAID treatment mean blood pressure -baseline mean blood pressure] [control treatment mean blood pressure baseline mean blood pressure]). Appendix Tables 3 and 4 present similar information for randomized, controlled trials without a placebo group. Because only two trials [41, 51] used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (both with same small sample sizes: n = 12) and all other trials assessed blood pressure using standardized mercury sphygmomanometers, the method of blood pressure measurement was not considered in the analysis.

Treatment Received in Randomized, Controlled Trials *Table OMITTED Appendix Table 3. Study Features of Randomized Trials without a Placebo Group *Table OMITTED Appendix Table 4. Treatment Received in Randomized Trials without a Placebo Group *Table OMITTED Combining the Trials The randomized, controlled trials assessing the effect of NSAIDs on blood pressure [14-51] may be readily subdivided into two broad categories (Appendix Table 3): those of predominantly white, middle-aged patients of both sexes with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension [29 trials] and those of predominantly white, healthy, young volunteers of both sexes with no history of hypertension and with normal blood pressure (15 trials). These broad categories may be further subdivided (Appendix Tables 1 and 2) into three groups of trials in hypertensive patients and two groups of trials involving normal volunteers based on whether or not antihypertensive therapy was coadministered and on its duration. Because all these trials were randomized and controlled, measured the effect of NSAIDs on blood pressure in patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension or healthy volunteers, and had no other apparent systematic differences between the trials in each of the five groups, we considered it clinically appropriate to pool their results. To assess whether these trials could be combined statistically, the randomized, contro", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37139811", "37234862", "37115960", "36912251", "36230222", "35893088", "35390421", "35234840", "35329224", "35130054", "35132561", "34905954", "34943230", "34850597", "34692276", "34289396", "34170889", "34101620", "33876393", "33793337", "33514562", "33192558", "32997126", "32761267", "32520869", "32508173", "32479922", "32495923", "32499470", "31937550", "31529687", "31212012", "31698367", "31586784", "31480335", "31471727", "31355212", "30531470", "31994525", "31690479", "31258091", "30399109", "30362840", "29291681", "30354828", "30354807", "30406113", "30118723", "30096158", "29793573", "29505772", "29602405", "29434680", "29171096", "28695614", "28885417", "28830958", "28573369", "28487435", "28451853", "28451850", "28491485", "27881247", "28276722", "27873228", "28766354", "27814606", "27317138", "27536519", "27225954", "26655222", "26271463", "26416811", "25956433", "26457127", "26421118", "27785299", "26112123", "25828847", "25829340", "25940579", "25908474", "25800393", "25691622", "25760878", "25533872", "24042856", "25439535", "25492840", "25618128", "25349652", "26104814", "25217433", "25136585", "24755117"], "label": "0"}

Plasma renin and aldosterone were determined on Days 2 and 9, with the subject supine, after 1 h of rest in the sitting position following 1 h of walking, and 3 h after oral intake of 40 mg furosemide, also in the sitting position. Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected on Days 1 and 8 for the measurement of the electrolytes, aldosterone pH1 and the urinary prostaglandins PGE2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TxB2. After the first day of treatment with 25 mg b.d. flosulide, the increase in body weight was close to significance (0.86 vs -0.08 kg with placebo). A dose- and time-dependent decrease in both active and inactive plasma renin were observed, whereas the fall in plasma and urinary aldosterone was statistically significant only after the higher dose of flosulide. These changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were observed in the absence of oedema. Two out of eight volunteers experienced a strong and immediate reduction in the excretion of prostaglandins but overall the two doses tested did not produce a statistically significant inhibition in renal prostaglandins, especially following repeated dosing.

Among the randomized, controlled trials with the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib, one study demonstrated a significant difference between rofecoxib and its NSAID comparator (naproxen) in the risk of CV thrombotic events. A combined analysis of individual patient data was undertaken to determine whether there was an excess of CV thrombotic events in patients treated with rofecoxib compared with those treated with placebo or nonselective NSAIDs. Methods and Results\u2014CV thrombotic events were assessed across 23 phase IIb to V rofecoxib studies. Comparisons were made between patients taking rofecoxib and those taking either placebo, naproxen (an NSAID with near-complete inhibition of platelet function throughout its dosing interval), or another nonselective NSAIDs used in the development program (diclofenac, ibuprofen, and nabumetone). The major outcome measure was the combined end point used by the Antiplatelet Trialists\u2019 Collaboration, which includes CV, hemorrhagic, and unknown deaths; nonfatal myocardial infarctions; and nonfatal strokes. More than 28 000 patients, representing >14 000 patient-years at risk, were analyzed. The relative risk for an end point was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.38) when comparing rofecoxib with placebo; 0.79 (95% CI: 0.40, 1.55) when comparing rofecoxib with non-naproxen NSAIDs; and 1.69 (95% CI: 1.07, 2.69) when comparing rofecoxib with naproxen. Conclusions\u2014This analysis provides no evidence for an excess of CV events for rofecoxib relative to either placebo or the non-naproxen NSAIDs that were studied. Differences observed between rofecoxib and naproxen are likely the result of the antiplatelet effects of the latter agent.", "outbound_citations": ["11792343", "11157642", "11509060", "11179262", "11171823", "11173047", "11275626", "11392445", "11028250", "10986213", "10943882", "10877012", "10693877", "10580458", "10500058", "10501435", "10383505", "10215647", "10096266", "9822058", "8375421", "8419003", "2081244", "3125883", "3933848"], "inbound_citations": ["35234840", "34198968", "27388291", "27575590", "27608487", "27308948", "26457127", "26316712", "25860222", "25026711"], "label": "1"}

The primary analysis used the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration end points, which include: (1) cardiovascular, hemorrhagic, and unknown deaths, (2) nonfatal myocardial infarction, and (3) nonfatal stroke. Other secondary thrombotic events were also examined. Separate analyses were performed for all patients and for those not taking aspirin. Data from all controlled, completed arthritis trials of > or =4 weeks duration, including 13 new drug application studies and 2 large post-marketing trials (CLASS and SUCCESS) were included for analyses. Patients were randomized to celecoxib at doses from 100 to 400 mg twice daily (18,942 patients; 5,668.2 patient-years of exposure), diclofenac 50 to 75 mg twice daily, ibuprofen 800 mg thrice daily, naproxen 500 mg twice daily (combined NSAID exposure of 11,143 patients; 3,612.2 patient-years), or placebo (1,794 subjects; 199.9 subject-years). Data from a long-term uncontrolled trial with 5,209 patients (6,950 patients-years) treated with celecoxib were included in a supplemental analysis. The entire 15-trial database was searched for possible serious thrombotic events as well as to identify all deaths. For these patients, detailed clinical data were obtained and reviewed by 2 of the investigators (WBW and JSB), who were independently and blinded to exposure, to classify the event as primary, secondary, or neither. All analyses were done using the intent-to-treat population, and time-to-event analyses were performed using per-patient data. To examine heterogeneity of results among studies, tests of interaction were performed using the Cox model. Incidences of the primary and secondary events were not significantly different between the celecoxib and placebo groups, nor for the celecoxib group compared with the NSAIDs group, regardless of aspirin use and NSAID type. The relative risks comparing celecoxib with the NSAIDs for the primary events were 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.61, p = 0.79) for all patients, and 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.56, p = 0.62) for the subgroup not taking aspirin.

The primary efficacy assessment was \u2018Throat Pain on Swallowing\u2019 on day 3. In addition, secondary quality-of-life assessments were performed on days 3 and 5. All adverse events and treatment-emergent signs and symptoms were recorded. Data from 313 patients were evaluable for efficacy (105 celecoxib 200 mg once daily, 107 celecoxib 200 mg twice daily, 101 diclofenac 75 mg twice daily). The upper 95% confidence limits for the visual analog scale of \u2018Throat Pain on Swallowing\u2019 on day 3 for celecoxib 200 mg once daily relative to diclofenac 75 mg twice daily, and celecoxib 200 mg twice daily relative to diclofenac 75 mg twice daily were 9.26 and 7.83, respectively. All secondary efficacy and quality-of-life measures were clinically similar for the three treatment groups, and no statistically significant differences were detected. The incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events were similar for all groups, but numerically higher among patients taking diclofenac than celecoxib. More patients in the diclofenac group reported gastrointestinal complaints (7.3%) compared with those in the celecoxib groups (4.3% in the celecoxib 200 mg once-daily group and 3.4% in the celecoxib 200 mg twice-daily group). In conclusion, 5 days of treatment with celecoxib 200 mg once daily is as effective as diclofenac 75 mg twice daily in the symptomatic treatment of viral pharyngitis.

New anti-inflammatory drugs have been developed in an attempt to improve their gastrointestinal side effect profile. Our objective was to compare the effect on gastrointestinal permeability of acute equieffective doses of four different NSAIDs; three were designed to reduce gastrointestinal mucosal injury. MATERIALS Healthy volunteers underwent sugar tests in a randomised fashion, 15 days apart, at: (1) baseline; (2) after two days of 75 mg slow release (microspheres) indomethacin; (3) after two days of 7.5 mg oral meloxicam which preferentially inhibits cyclooxygenase 2; and (4) after two days of 750 mg naproxen. A subgroup of subjects was tested after two days of 200 mg celecoxib. In each test, subjects ingested a solution containing sucrose, lactulose, and mannitol and sucralose, to evaluate gastroduodenal, intestinal, and colonic permeability, respectively. RESULTS Gastric permeability was significantly affected by naproxen (p<0.05) but not by slow release indomethacin, meloxicam, or celecoxib. Intestinal permeability was significantly increased by the first three NSAIDs (p<0.05) but not by celecoxib. Abnormal lactulose/mannitol ratios were observed in 42% of meloxicam treatments, in 62% during indomethacin, and in 75% of subjects treated with naproxen. Finally, colonic permeability, as measured by sucralose, was not significantly increased by any of the four drugs. CONCLUSION Our study provides evidence that the newly developed NSAIDs reduce gastric mucosal permeability significantly. However, most produced significant alteration of small intestinal permeability. In contrast, our results suggest that celecoxib seems to exhibit the most desirable gastrointestinal side effect profile.", "outbound_citations": ["10986213", "10994617", "10792129", "10446103", "10369403", "10233193", "10951657", "9626023", "9690719", "9428239", "9428222", "9561441", "9712237", "9365818", "9203940", "9146759", "8978349", "9097995", "8628981", "7572894", "7909091", "8043223", "8500718", "8500743", "8444070", "1568563", "1546927", "1782303", "1933208", "1671893", "1901563", "2120205", "2220886", "2128070", "2120769", "2387527", "2317122", "3345876", "2888943", "3917814", "3968618", "3928859", "6107406", "873124", "5284360", "9149052", "9434280", "6432500", "2493366", "2787642", "2302984", "2311975", "2015469"], "inbound_citations": ["36473615", "35567815", "35783372", "34513903", "34135912", "33911896", "33552178", "33331088", "32629992", "31100459", "31270586", "30667372", "30720188", "29142512", "28462884", "28130543", "27853388", "27763627", "27083387", "27246797", "26914765", "18604233", "26091645", "25433956", "24859298", "24859230"], "label": "0"}

The incidence of adverse events was monitored throughout the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nValdecoxib was clinically and statistically superior to placebo for Patient's and Physician's Global Assessment of Arthritis and for all WOMAC OA Indices over the 12 week study period (P<or= 0.05). Valdecoxib 10 mg was similar to naproxen in terms of efficacy, and demonstrated greater numerical improvements compared with valdecoxib 5 mg. Valdecoxib 5 mg and 10 mg demonstrated similar tolerability compared to placebo and a lower incidence of GI-related adverse effects compared with naproxen.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSingle daily doses of valdecoxib 5 mg and 10 mg were similar to naproxen and superior to placebo, in treating symptomatic OA of the hip. Both doses of valdecoxib were well tolerated and demonstrated improved GI tolerability compared to naproxen.", "outbound_citations": ["10979111", "10871971", "10782831", "10715145", "10560596", "9737710", "9596549", "9077531", "9175123", "8687261", "7991575", "7907735", "1834002", "3741515", "6419595", "6416259", "14280261"], "inbound_citations": ["36361772", "34262619", "27659504", "27359284"], "label": "1"}

Five hundred and thirteen patients were treated in a double-blind trial comparing once-daily meloxicam 7.5 mg, 15mg, 30mg, or placebo (140, 134, 102 and 137 patients, respectively). Outcome measures included scores on Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for pain on movement (primary endpoint) and pain at rest in the target joint as well as global efficacy. Lesquesne's index of severity and paracetamol consumption were also measured. Global tolerability and the occurrence of adverse events were monitored. Both meloxicam 7.5 mg and 15 mg were significantly more effective than placebo with respect to pain on movement (p < 0.01 and p < 0.03, respectively). Both doses of meloxicam compared favourably with placebo with respect to pain of the target joint at rest, although only the 15 mg dose achieved statistical significance (p < 0.02). Global efficacy showed a significant difference for both doses of meloxicam (p < 0.05 and p < 0.002 for 7.5 mg and 15 mg doses, respectively).

Patients who had AS according to the modified New York criteria, without peripheral synovitis and with active disease (pain > or =40 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS] and an increase in pain of at least 30% after nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug withdrawal) were eligible for study. Primary outcome measures were change in pain intensity (VAS) and change in functional impairment (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI]).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 246 randomized patients, 76 were allocated to receive placebo, 90 ketoprofen, and 80 celecoxib. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups at study entry.

Subjects were assigned to 1 of 4 study groups: Group 1, placebo (vitamin C, 500 mg per os [PO]); Group 2, acetaminophen 2000 mg PO; Group 3, celecoxib 200 mg PO; or Group 4, acetaminophen 2000 mg and celecoxib 200 mg PO. All patients received a standardized anesthetic technique. During the postoperative period, pain was assessed using a 10-point verbal rating scale. Recovery times, the need for rescue analgesics, side effects, and patient satisfaction scores were also recorded. The combination of acetaminophen and celecoxib was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing postoperative pain. Celecoxib, when administered alone or in combination with acetaminophen, improved patients\u2019 satisfaction with their postoperative analgesia. With the combination of acetaminophen and celecoxib, an additional expenditure of $6.16 would be required to obtain complete satisfaction with postoperative pain management in one additional patient who would not have been completely satisfied if he/she had received the placebo.

One hypothesis is that COX-1 inhibition may play a relevant pathogenic role. If so, drugs that are not active on COX-1 would be expected to be well tolerated by CU patients.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed at assessing the tolerability of a central analgesic (tramadol) in a group of patients with CU and a history of intolerance to several NSAIDs, asking for a safe, alternative compound.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-eight patients with CU exacerbated by several, distinct NSAIDs underwent single-blind, placebo-controlled, oral challenges with increasing doses of tramadol (50 mg total dose). Most of them underwent oral challenges with rofecoxib, paracetamol, and/or nimesulide as well.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-three patients tolerated tramadol, whereas, surprisingly, in 5 (18%) patients tramadol induced urticaria, in one case with laryngeal edema. A similar proportion of CU patients did not tolerate rofecoxib, and higher proportions of patients did not tolerate acetaminophen and nimesulide.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMechanisms other than COX inhibition may also play a role in drug intolerance in patients with CU. In CU patients intolerant to NSAID, the tolerability of tramadol, as well as of other \"alternative\" drugs, should be assessed by oral challenge tests.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33974096", "31100553", "28550985", "28573063"], "label": "0"}

The analgesic efficacy of the cyclooxygenase-2 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, celecoxib and rofecoxib, have not been evaluated after major orthopedic surgery. This study was designed to determine whether the administration of a preoperative dose of celecoxib or rofecoxib to patients who have undergone spinal stabilization would decrease patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine use and/or enhance analgesia. We evaluated 60 inpatients undergoing spine stabilization by one surgeon. All patients received PCA morphine. The patients were divided into three groups. Preoperatively, they were given oral celecoxib 200 mg, rofecoxib 50 mg, or placebo. The outcome measures included pain scores and 24-h morphine use at six times during the first 24 postoperative h. The total dose of morphine and the cumulative doses for each of the six time periods were significantly more in the placebo group than in the other two groups. The morphine dose was significantly less in five of the six time intervals in the rofecoxib group compared with the celecoxib group. The pain scores were significantly less in the rofecoxib group than in the other two groups at two of the six intervals, and less than the placebo group in an additional interval. Although both rofecoxib and celecoxib produce similar analgesic effects in the first 4 h after surgery, rofecoxib demonstrated an extended analgesic effect that lasted throughout the 24-h study. We thus recommend that rofecoxib be used as a preoperative component of pain management that includes PCA morphine in patients undergoing spine stabilization surgery.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nThe cyclooxygenase-2-specific nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, celecoxib and rofecoxib, both demonstrate an opioid-sparing effect after spinal fusion surgery. Celecoxib resulted in decreased morphine use for the first 8 h after surgery, whereas rofecoxib demonstrated less morphine use throughout the 24-h study period.", "outbound_citations": ["10804043", "10643694", "10566562", "10377455", "10440619", "10390125", "10227244", "10096266", "9661554", "8569017", "9223200", "7854808", "7991575", "7978444", "8038702", "8105724", "8454631", "2064886", "802670", "5284360"], "inbound_citations": ["33443656", "31693519", "28822648", "27354716", "25886746", "26619518", "25911562"], "label": "0"}

Meloxicam 7.5 mg or piroxicam 20 mg daily was administered for 4 weeks in this double-blind parallel-groups randomised study. The efficacy for pain relief of the two tested medications was assessed by means of visual analogue scale and other clinical parameters. Pre- and post-treatment endoscopies were performed, and the findings were scored and recorded. The gastric fluid was aspirated at each time and prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2 and leukotriene B4 were determined by ELISA. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the primary efficacy. Changes in endoscopic findings by means of Lanza score showed statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in favour of meloxicam at all sites--gastric, duodenal and total. Within-group comparisons showed a statistically significant difference (worsening) in gastric and total score with piroxicam, but no significant difference with meloxicam. The frequency of clinically relevant cases (total score >2) also showed a statistically significant worsening in the piroxicam group. The better GI tolerability of meloxicam was also suggested by fewer adverse GI events and no withdrawals due to adverse events compared with piroxicam. The pre-/post-study gastric juice concentration of PGE2, TXB2, and LTB4 in the meloxicam group was 135.2 +/- 85.8/71.2 +/- 32.2, 116.3 +/- 81.7/99.4 +/- 107.5 and 388 +/- 321/223 +/- 98 pg/ml respectively. The pre-/post-study gastric juice concentration of PGE2, TXB2 and LTB4 in the piroxicam group was 105.7 +/- 43.1/68.2 +/- 34.9, 94.0 +/- 50.9/105.9 +/- 121.1 and 625 +/- 1574/828 +/- 1464 pg/ml, respectively. Both meloxicam and piroxicam significantly inhibited gastric PGE2 levels after 4 weeks' treatment; however, there was no difference between these two groups. Neither of these medications had an effect on TXB2. Only meloxicam inhibited LTB4 concentration significantly, and the between-groups difference was significant. Meloxicam 7.5 mg once daily had better gastrointestinal tolerability and an efficacy comparable to that of piroxicam 20 mg over 4 weeks in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.", "outbound_citations": ["9783758", "9783757", "9723821", "9034984", "9561120", "19078048", "8633574", "8630636", "8630631", "8534265", "8534264", "7965814", "7983662", "7510883", "8265610", "8357002", "8454631", "2052056", "2027107", "2120205", "2120289", "2142085", "2310655", "2491826", "2703138", "2657289", "2979261", "3116776", "3557003", "2941572", "3834587", "3915884", "6754389", "6956930", "6258197", "7350051", "4415426", "5284360"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

It is characterized by acute, extensive formation of nonfollicular sterile pustules on erythematous background, fever, and peripheral blood leukocytosis. We present clinical and immunological data on four patients with this disease, which is caused by different drugs. An involvement of T cells could be implied by positive skin patch tests and lymphocyte transformation tests. Immunohistochemistry revealed a massive cell infiltrate consisting of neutrophils in pustules and T cells in the dermis and epidermis. Expression of the potent neutrophil-attracting chemokine IL-8 was elevated in keratinocytes and infiltrating mononuclear cells. Drug-specific T cells were generated from the blood and skin of three patients, and phenotypic characterization showed a heterogeneous distribution of CD4/CD8 phenotype and of T-cell receptor Vbeta-expression. Analysis of cytokine/chemokine profiles revealed that IL-8 is produced significantly more by drug-specific T cells from patients with AGEP compared with drug-specific T cells from patients that had non-AGEP exanthemas. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the involvement of drug-specific T cells in the pathomechanism of this rather rare and peculiar form of drug allergy. In addition, they indicate that even in some neutrophil-rich inflammatory responses specific T cells are engaged and might orchestrate the immune reaction.", "outbound_citations": ["11112902", "10843725", "10848903", "10856665", "10718859", "10227340", "9886437", "9824415", "9788973", "9764148", "9620607", "9540273", "9542601", "9867362", "9344212", "9295020", "9202065", "9130515", "9013953", "9061217", "8957644", "8757611", "8566082", "8864623", "7650395", "7602118", "7616006", "7524836", "7504995", "1832534", "2677047", "2824608", "3021832", "6989310", "4195865", "4236712", "PMC508173", "PMC509010", "PMC329758", "10998137", "8932582"], "inbound_citations": ["35909299", "35403293", "35386664", "35113364", "35663770", "34832859", "34361007", "34016669", "33812790", "33976640", "33405402", "33772517", "33461991", "33190407", "33039007", "32885892", "33341199", "32383256", "32695700", "32014613", "30817022", "31758810", "31696801", "31020549", "31037850", "30667074", "31118731", "30395846", "30014493", "29288651", "28219704", "28796198", "28684647", "28358593", "28320307", "26552363", "28804742", "27960170", "27966434", "27518666", "27472323", "25880610", "26674736", "26488335", "26688759", "26354880", "25998949", "26273160", "26155441", "25784092", "25846351", "27075126", "25439377", "25017686", "25030504", "24852773"], "label": "0"}

Patients receiving valdecoxib experienced a significantly quicker onset of analgesia, significantly improved pain relief, and lower pain intensity compared with patients receiving rofecoxib and greater satisfaction with their study medication after a single dose.

Comparison of the NANSAID rofexocib with naproxen showed a substantial difference in acute myocardial infarction risk, which has been interpreted as a protective effect of naproxen. We did an observational study to measure the effects of NANSAIDs, including naproxen, on risk of serious coronary heart disease. We used data from the Tennessee Medicaid programme obtained between Jan 1, 1987, and Dec 31, 1998, to identify a cohort of new NANSAID users (n=181 441) and an equal number of non-users, matched for age, sex, and date NANSAID use began. Both groups were 50-84 years of age, were not resident in a nursing home, and did not have life-threatening illness. The study endpoint was hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease. During 532634 person-years of follow-up, 6362 cases of serious coronary heart disease occurred, or 11.9 per 1000 person-years. Multivariate-adjusted rate ratios for current and former use of NANSAIDs were 1.05 (95% CI 0.97-1.14) and 1.02 (0.97-1.08), respectively. Rate ratios for naproxen, ibuprofen, and other NANSAIDs were 0.95 (0.82-1.09), 1.15 (1.02-1.28), and 1.03 (0.92-1.16), respectively. There was no protection among long-term NANSAID users with uninterrupted use; the rate ratio among current users with more than 60 days of continuous use was 1.05 (0.91-1.21). When naproxen was directly compared with ibuprofen, the current-use rate ratio was 0.83 (0.69-0.98).

Estrogen-induced responses in vascular cells have been shown to influence prostaglandins and cyclooxygenase (COX), a key enzyme in the production of prostaglandins, with two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. We investigated the effects of prostaglandins on the acute potentiation by 17beta-estradiol (E) of acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated vasodilation in the cutaneous vasculature. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled design, we assessed skin blood flow in 32 healthy, postmenopausal women by laser Doppler velocimetry with direct current iontophoresis of ACh and sodium nitroprusside before and after 6-wk treatment periods with aspirin (a nonspecific COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor), diclofenac (predominantly a COX-2 inhibitor, which also inhibits COX-1), celecoxib (a specific COX-2 inhibitor), given at anti-inflammatory doses, or placebo. Blood flux values before iontophoresis of ACh did not differ between the treatment groups or after E administration, excluding a direct cutaneous vasodilator effect of the treatments or of E. Acute E administration enhanced the response to ACh after aspirin, diclofenac, and placebo; however, this effect was completely abolished with celecoxib treatment (P < 0.05). E had no effect on sodium nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation after any of the treatments.

Diclofenac sodium is the most commonly prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug worldwide; it is effective for the treatment of pain as well as the signs and symptoms associated with the painful conditions of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg, 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg, and placebo over 8-hour and 24-hour periods in patients with moderate to severe pain after oral surgery. In this double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, parallel-group study, patients experiencing moderate to severe pain after the surgical extraction of > or = 2 third molars were randomized to receive a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg, 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (50 mg given every 8 hours), or placebo. Patients rated pain intensity, pain relief, and global assessments at prespecified times throughout the 24-hour period after initial dosing. Overall analgesic efficacy was determined by total pain relief over 8 hours (TOPAR8) and 24 hours (TOPAR24) and patient global assessments at 8 and 24 hours. Onset of analgesic effect was determined by using the 2-stopwatch method for confirmed perceptible pain relief. Peak analgesic effect was the maximum pain relief attained during the first 8 hours. The duration of analgesic effect was determined by median time to rescue analgesia use. A total of 305 patients were randomized to treatment: 121 received rofecoxib, 121 received diclofenac sodium, and 63 received placebo. The baseline demographics were similar among the groups. Overall, 61.3% experienced moderate pain and 38.7% experienced severe pain; 53.1% were female; and the mean age was 23.4 years. The overall analgesic efficacy, as assessed by TOPAR8, of a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg was significantly greater than a single dose of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (20.5 vs 8.2) and placebo (20.5 vs 5.9). Patient global assessment at 8 hours was also significantly better for rofecoxib compared with enteric-coated diclofenac sodium and placebo. TOPAR24 was significantly greater for a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg compared with 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (64.1 vs 25.1) and placebo (64.1 vs 19.2). At 24 hours, the patient global assessment for rofecoxib was significantly better than that achieved with enteric-coated diclofenac sodium and placebo. The onset of analgesic effect was significantly more rapid for rofecoxib than for enteric-coated diclofenac sodium and placebo (median times: 31 minutes, >4 hours, and >4 hours, respectively). The peak analgesic effect was significantly greater for rofecoxib compared with enteric-coated diclofenac sodium (3.2 vs 1.5) and placebo (3.2 vs 1.1). The duration of analgesia was significantly longer for rofecoxib than enteric-coated diclofenac sodium (median times: >24 hours vs 1 hour and 37 minutes) and placebo (>24 hours vs 1 hour and 37 minutes). Enteric-coated diclofenac sodium was numerically greater than placebo for the key end points measuring overall efficacy (total pain relief and patient global assessment), but diclofenac sodium did not provide as much analgesic effect as expected for a drug effective for pain, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis and did not differ significantly from placebo. Overall, both rofecoxib and enteric-coated diclofenac sodium were generally well tolerated, although the rofecoxib group had a significantly lower incidence of clinical and drug-related adverse events than the enteric-coated diclofenac sodium group. A single 50-mg dose of rofecoxib provided greater overall analgesic efficacy over 8 hours, more rapid onset of analgesia, greater maximum analgesic effect, and longer duration of effect than a single 50-mg dose of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium in patients with moderate to severe pain associated with oral surgery. Compared with 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (50 mg every 8 hours), a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg provided greater overall analgesic efficacy over 24 hours.", "outbound_citations": ["11589259", "11165987", "11198829", "11143737", "11049005", "10566562", "10511349", "10440619", "8021330", "1860132", "3307859", "7028529"], "inbound_citations": ["27610712", "27731828", "26151766", "24490793", "25436192"], "label": "0"}

Plasma samples were obtained at least 7 days after the first dose and meloxicam plasma concentrations were quantified by h.p.l.c.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNONMEM analysis was conducted on plasma samples derived from 586 patients. A one-compartmental model was found to describe the data adequately. For a typical subject in the population, a clearance of 0.377 l h-1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0304-0.449) in males and 0.347 l h-1 (95% CI 0.274-0.419) in females was obtained. The volume of distribution was estimated to be 14.9 l. The findings were corroborated by subsequent analysis using WinBUGS. Analysis of covariates showed that age and gender both significantly (P < 0.005) affected clearance. The effect of age was relatively small and a dose adjustment of <10% was deemed unnecessary. Differences between males and females were attributed to differences in weight. No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions were found, although sulphasalazine and glucocorticoids both significantly (P < 0.005) affected meloxicam clearance (+19% and - 12%, respectively). The mechanisms by which these agents affect meloxicam clearance remain to be elucidated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe population pharmacokinetic meloxicam data from patients with RA gave similar results to those obtained from phase I trials. However, uncommon drug interactions may not be detected in phase I trials because of the small number of observations made.", "outbound_citations": ["1287200", "7589049", "10092958", "9493314", "9354315", "9404473", "9150070", "9034984", "9117175", "8630631", "8596147", "8591720", "2213774", "2328562", "2183172", "3199396", "3358796", "3501723", "3490574", "3538867", "3901735", "3884880", "13596783", "9105543", "2788089", "PMC1113321", "9624076", "PMC2042861", "8882748"], "inbound_citations": ["36973693", "36601711", "31447556", "30216103", "29024493", "27221375"], "label": "0"}

The study comprised three treatment periods. First, furosemide (40 mg) was administered as a single oral daily dose for 3 days. A wash-out day was followed by the administration of meloxicam (15 mg) as a single oral daily dose for 10 days. Thereafter, meloxicam and furosemide were administered concomitantly at the same doses as described above, for 3 days. The effect of concomitant ingestion of meloxicam and furosemide on furosemide-induced diuresis, urine and serum electrolytes, and furosemide pharmacokinetics was determined, after both single and repeated administration of furosemide. Estimates of the \"(furosemide+meloxicam)/(furosemide alone)\" mean ratio of the variable AUC(0-infinity) for plasma furosemide and the cumulative sodium excretion (0-8 h) were 97.4% (90% confidence interval 89.7-106%) and 88% (90% confidence interval 82-94%), respectively. The study results indicate that meloxicam does not affect the pharmacokinetics of furosemide in healthy volunteers, nor does it affect furosemide-induced diuresis or serum electrolytes. The cumulative urinary electrolyte excretion after concomitant administration of meloxicam and furosemide is somewhat lower than after administration of furosemide alone, in particular for the period 0-8 h after administration of furosemide.

Gastroduodenal ulceration was assessed by endoscopy at 6, 12, and (for active treatment) 24 weeks.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacies of celecoxib and ibuprofen for the treatment of acute pain. The null hypothesis was that no difference between celecoxib and ibuprofen exists.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. After consent, patients rated their pain on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and categorical intensity pain scale. Patients were then randomized to receive 200-mg or 400-mg celecoxib or 600-mg ibuprofen (all orally). Patients were contacted 5 hours after receiving study medication when a second VAS score was recorded, along with categorical pain intensity, pain relief score, side effects, and number of rescue medications taken. The main outcome measures were change in visual analog pain and categorical pain intensity scores, and pain relief scores, at five hours.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred ten patients were evaluated and 105 were enrolled. Thirty-four received celecoxib 200 mg, 32 received celecoxib 400 mg, and 39 received ibuprofen 600 mg. Ninety-one were available for the five-hour VAS and 88 for the five-hour categorical pain intensity and pain relief analysis: The two patients who were unable to read a VAS were excluded, and two enrolled patients withdrew prior to medication. One patient was excluded because his injury was a fracture, and therefore did not meet the inclusion criteria. There was no statistical difference among the treatment groups in age, time from injury to medication, initial VAS score, percent lost to follow-up, or treatment with adjunctive therapy. There was no statistical difference in change of VAS among the groups at five hours: ibuprofen 600 mg (-23.8 mm [95% CI = -31.56 mm to -16.1 mm] [n = 32]), celecoxib 200 mg (-16.1 mm [95% CI = -24.3 mm to -7.98 mm] [n = 31]), and celecoxib 400 mg (-12.4 mm [95% CI = -23.1 mm to -1.8 mm] [n = 30]) (p = 0.16). There was no significant difference between the groups, at five hours, in change of categorical pain intensity (p = 0.11) or pain relief scores (p = 0.059), though the pain relief scale approached significance favoring ibuprofen.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNo significant difference exists among emergency department (ED) patients treated for acute pain, at five hours, with celecoxib 200 mg, celecoxib 400 mg, or ibuprofen 600 mg, though the power of the study to detect a change was low, 36%. However, the magnitude of pain relief for celecoxib, coupled with the cost of the medication, questions its use in the immediate ED setting.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32930964", "30652262"], "label": "0"}

Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: A university department of obstetrics and gynaecology. Subjects: 76 women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Interventions: Treatment for five days from day 1 of menses during three consecutive menstrual periods. 27 patients were randomised to take ethamsylate 500 mg six hourly, 23 patients to take mefenamic acid 500 mg eight hourly, and 26 patients to take tranexamic acid 1 g six hourly. Main outcome measures: Menstrual loss measured by the alkaline haematin method in three control menstrual periods and three menstrual periods during treatment; duration of bleeding; patient's estimation of blood loss; sanitary towel usage; the occurrence of dysmenorrhoea; and unwanted events. Results: Ethamsylate did not reduce mean menstrual blood loss whereas mefenamic acid reduced blood loss by 20% (mean blood loss 186 ml before treatment, 148 ml during treatment) and tranexamic acid reduced blood loss by 54% (mean blood loss 164 ml before treatment, 75 ml during treatment). Sanitary towel usage was significantly reduced in patients treated with mefenamic acid and tranexamic acid. Conclusions: Tranexamic acid given during menstruation is a safe and highly effective treatment for excessive bleeding. Patients with dysfunctional uterine bleeding should be offered medical treatment with tranexamic acid before a decision is made about surgery.

After a second 2 week wash-out period, one dose of indomethacin 50 mg was given as a positive control to check for NSAID induced inhibition of platelet function. COX-1 inhibition was measured as percentage inhibition of serum TXB2 generation in clotting whole blood, and as closure time with use of the platelet function analyser PFA-100. Data are reported as median with range. Paired variables were analysed using Wilcoxons signed rank test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTXB2 levels decreased significantly after all three medications, but percentage inhibition after nabumetone and indomethacin (88% and 97%, respectively) was significantly higher than after meloxicam (63%) (P<0.05). Closure times increased significantly after administration of all three medications (P<0.05). Increases in closure time after administration did not differ between nabumetone and meloxicam (24% and 14%, respectively), but were significantly larger after indomethacin administration (63%) (P<0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the maximum registered dosage, nabumetone inhibits thromboxane production much more than meloxicam, signifying less COX-2 selectivity of the former. However, both nabumetone and meloxicam cause only minor impairment in platelet function in comparison with indomethacin and the difference between them is not significant.", "outbound_citations": ["11509060", "11185674", "10822076", "10546927", "10381787", "9626023", "9278200", "7554708", "8121485", "3790723", "3933848", "3898913", "6411052", "6812166", "PMC2042813", "10500058"], "inbound_citations": ["36601711", "33317595", "30215226"], "label": "0"}

Separate analyses were conducted for all patients and for those who did not respond to acetaminophen. Outcome probabilities were obtained from a comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Costs were derived from actual resource utilization of OA patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn terms of averting GI events, acetaminophen dominates the other options for an average risk patient population. For patients who did not respond to acetaminophen, rofecoxib had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per GI event avoided (32,000 US dollars) relative to ibuprofen. In terms of pain control, ibuprofen had an ICER of 610.77 US dollars per additional patient achieving minimal perceptible clinical improvement (MPCI) relative to acetaminophen, while rofecoxib had an ICER of 12,000 US dollars relative to ibuprofen. For patients who did not respond to acetaminophen and who are at high risk of developing an adverse GI event, rofecoxib dominates ibuprofen as the preferred alternative for both measures of effectiveness. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses established that these results were generally robust.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that for average-risk knee OA patients, acetaminophen dominates the other therapies in terms of cost per GI event averted. In terms of pain relief, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicate that if one values pain relief below 275 US dollars per patient achieving MPCI, acetaminophen is the therapy most likely to be optimal; between 275 US dollars and 14,150 US dollars, ibuprofen is most likely to be optimal; and above 14,150 US dollars, rofecoxib is most likely to be optimal.", "outbound_citations": ["12428249", "11809254", "11809181", "11754710", "11828834", "11505178", "11465696", "11465710", "11276803", "11276802", "11087881", "11037892", "10979111", "10904451", "10925968", "10871971", "10765939", "10782831", "11014340", "11093446", "10662872", "10580458", "10560596", "9990816", "10086830", "9712607", "9672328", "9588729", "9433865", "9402773", "9343807", "9041931", "8709394", "8669432", "8664664", "7611589", "7794085", "7638569", "7900721", "7827647", "8216413", "8424842", "1432021", "1637896", "2052056", "1670734", "14872935"], "inbound_citations": ["35138600", "34879102", "34262974", "33795939", "31708059", "31413608", "28288564", "26746146", "25048053", "24925692"], "label": "0"}

Verbal analogue pain scores (VAS) and postoperative oxycodone consumption were measured for 48 hr. Eight patients (47%; four in each group) had side effects or logistical problems complicating care. The mean VAS scores at rest and with movement in the postanesthesia care unit and at 12 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr were not different (P > 0.1). Inadequate analgesia was reported in 50-75% of all study patients.

Mean age of voluntary persons (n = 32) was 42.3 +/- 2.7. Divided into 3 groups of volunteers were given randomized placebo (n = 10), aspirin (n = 10) (500 mg aspirin, Bayer) and nimesulide (n = 12) (100 mg mesulid, Pfizer) with 50 mL of water after 12 hours fasting period at 08.00 am. Gastroduodenoscopy was performed to the volunteers 3 hours after each therapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEndoscopic scores of groups were; placebo: 0.20 +/- 0.13, aspirin: 2.8 +/- 0.46, nimesulide: 1.41 +/- 0.51. Lesion scores both in the aspirin group when compared with nimesulide and placebo groups (P < 0.00002, < 0.03), and in the nimesulide group when compared with the placebo group (P < 0.01) were significantly high. The positivity of Helicobacter pylori of groups was found; 67% in placebo, 72% in aspirin, 71% in nimesulide and there was no statistically significant difference in the groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt was shown that nimesulide causes significantly serious gastric mucosal lesion when compared with placebo.

Randomized-controlled trials in such patients are rare for ethical reasons. We studied the incidence of gastrointestinal complications in high-risk patients taking long-term low-dose aspirin or non-aspirin-NSAIDs combined with omeprazole in a real-life clinical setting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a multicentre, prospective and observational study including 247 consecutive high-risk patients who had a clinical indication for long-term treatment with either low-dose aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs and omeprazole therapy. The occurrence of gastrointestinal complications was measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn addition to a recent history of peptic ulcer bleeding, all patients had at least 1 other risk factor and 112 (45.3%) had 3 or more risk factors; 78.9% were taking low-dose aspirin and the remainder non-aspirin NSAIDs. Mean follow-up was 14.6 +/- 10.38 months. Three patients taking low-dose aspirin developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding (1.2%; 95% CI 0.3-3.5; 1.0 event/100 patients/year). This was similar to the rate observed in studies involving non-high-risk patients taking low-dose aspirin and higher than that observed in patients not taking low-dose aspirin. Two additional patients developed a lower gastrointestinal bleeding event (0.81% (0.04%-3.12%); 0.67 events/100 patients/year), which was within the range expected in NSAID users.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of omeprazole in the high-risk patient taking low-dose aspirin or NSAIDs seems to be a safe therapeutic approach in this population and is associated with a low frequency of upper gastrointestinal complications.", "outbound_citations": ["11274623", "11166003", "11087881", "11073508", "10995862", "10904451", "9494148", "9692687", "8961361", "7625622", "7611589", "7711618", "7907735", "8405852", "8330469", "1960301", "1866002", "2022014", "2563096", "2857803", "7438381"], "inbound_citations": ["37092495", "30487673", "28463532", "27371500", "25945005", "25800393", "25846476"], "label": "1"}
