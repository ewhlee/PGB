In a multicenter study performed in Denmark, a total of 376 perimenopausal women with climacteric symptoms were randomly allocated to oral sequential treatment with either E2-DSG (1.5 mg E2 for 24 days with 0.15 mg DSG for the last 12 days followed by a placebo tablet for 4 days) (n = 186) or with E2V-MPA (2 mg E2V for 21 days with 10 mg MPA for the last 10 days) (n = 190).

This study investigated the efficacy of 17beta-estradiol for the treatment of clinically significant depressive disorders in endocrinologically confirmed perimenopausal women.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPerimenopausal women (aged 40-55 years, with irregular menstrual periods and serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone >25 IU/L), meeting criteria for major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, or minor depressive disorder, according to DSM-IV, were randomized to receive transdermal patches of 17beta-estradiol (100 microgram) or placebo in a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A 4-week washout period followed the 12-week treatment phase. Outcome measures were the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Blatt-Kupperman Menopausal Index scores.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty women were enrolled in the study; 26 met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder, 11 for dysthymic disorder, and 13 for minor depressive disorder. Remission of depression was observed in 17 (68%) women treated with 17beta-estradiol compared with 5 (20%) in the placebo group (P =.001). Subjects responded similarly to estradiol treatment, regardless of DSM-IV diagnosis. Patients treated with estradiol sustained antidepressant benefit of treatment after the 4-week washout period, although somatic complaints increased in frequency and intensity. Treatment was well tolerated and adverse events were rare in both groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTransdermal estradiol replacement is an effective treatment of depression for perimenopausal women.", "outbound_citations": ["11231840", "10992206", "10963836", "10942479", "10831472", "10902422", "10485972", "10321913", "9807636", "9643512", "11907932", "9286204", "9153161", "9076645", "8598756", "9010707", "7778430", "7632640", "7966923", "8055122", "8038941", "8000563", "1487384", "1565020", "2014092", "2053622", "2880114", "7062114", "6268783", "444788", "645412", "338104", "201958", "322905", "172181", "1156748", "13050216"], "inbound_citations": ["37068417", "37159774", "37065890", "37008184", "36855177", "36650256", "36639604", "36672399", "36447434", "36184501", "36002492", "35908135", "35875795", "35809362", "35616610", "35493954", "35407369", "35710453", "34976742", "34865661", "34945077", "34753328", "34837807", "34758906", "34623401", "34613495", "34533410", "34607269", "34868559", "34097071", "33949252", "33858012", "33836221", "33676942", "33573787", "33438886", "33470755", "33220387", "33292309", "33044248", "32804146", "32788687", "32893509", "32723604", "32456504", "32509856", "32023608", "31473086", "31634680", "31780032", "31768664", "31740049", "31630610", "31581598", "31461541", "31372757", "31355688", "31078198", "31078195", "31248319", "31211521", "29956632", "30967121", "30903287", "30863326", "30182804", "30041006", "30379725", "30589890", "30401549", "30216118", "30311279", "30284466", "30179986", "30581288", "30356982", "30202763", "29723767", "29080671", "29375366", "29362726", "30414016", "28719421", "28609392", "28544903", "28460354", "28650869", "28664754", "28477647", "28477650", "28291028", "27824682", "28966563", "28706407", "26807812", "27871902", "28144217"], "label": "1"}

Subjects expended 15 kcal/kg of lean body mass (LBM) per day in supervised exercise at 70% of aerobic capacity while consuming a clinical dietary product to set energy availability at 45 and either 10, 20, or 30 kcal/kg LBM.d in two randomized trials separated by at least 2 months. Blood was sampled daily during treatments and at 10-min intervals for the next 24 h. Samples were assayed for LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, insulin, cortisol, GH, IGF-I, IGF-I binding protein (IGFBP)-1, IGFBP-3, leptin, and T3. LH pulsatility was unaffected by an energy availability of 30 kcal/kg LBM.d (P > 0.3), but below this threshold LH pulse frequency decreased, whereas LH pulse amplitude increased (all P < 0.04). This disruption was more extreme in women with short luteal phases (P < 0.01). These incremental effects most closely resembled the effects of energy availability on plasma glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, GH, and cortisol and contrasted with the dependencies displayed by the other metabolic hormones (simultaneously P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that LH pulsatility is disrupted only below a threshold of energy availability deep into negative energy balance and suggest priorities for future investigations into the mechanism that mediates the nonlinear dependence of LH pulsatility on energy availability.", "outbound_citations": ["11701675", "11714504", "11344262", "11238765", "11237214", "10846016", "10618160", "10480606", "29592679", "10499510", "10072104", "9851755", "9535943", "9519731", "9451615", "9140913", "8954031", "8750890", "8531610", "7611392", "7926305", "8157720", "8263048", "27439192", "8447379", "1597158", "1630733", "1538563", "1337612", "1661182", "1845336", "2122728", "2199748", "2537332", "2493024", "3008572", "2937307", "3990734", "6493093", "6735803", "6874738", "6765504", "6775000", "836520", "4915800"], "inbound_citations": ["37221858", "37213050", "37180969", "37139171", "37053143", "37052052", "37019841", "36894187", "36847823", "36841899", "36811697", "36771357", "36837787", "36572039", "36361122", "36353726", "36165993", "36137732", "36061453", "35894910", "35819582", "35836334", "36479178", "35795153", "35718216", "35813848", "35582863", "35522259", "35627502", "35564974", "35565840", "35460534", "35380508", "35268044", "35267961", "35171303", "35146569", "35256056", "35172924", "35080753", "35162245", "35045802", "34979587", "34934398", "34865242", "34905874", "34812202", "34784926", "36122585", "34665451", "34689218", "34643795", "34623696", "34684376", "34515972", "34524193", "34524193", "34444987", "34444803", "34336338", "34306727", "34181189", "34091537", "34037744", "34021096", "34054716", "34077990", "33884586", "33832385", "33846724", "33794937", "33789771", "33736663", "33803566", "33671093", "34108008", "33465762", "33505718", "34348519", "33045257", "33346900", "33345352", "33273407", "33307469", "33196464", "33155355", "33356773", "33108971", "33095376", "33105389", "33067637", "33017351", "32979879", "33101190", "32960961", "32940695", "32910256", "32870266", "32984399", "32619140", "32843957", "32557402", "33467243", "32311152", "32236752", "32191158", "32106083", "31887723", "32079440", "32197237", "32736757", "31743086", "31696452", "31261172", "31564683", "31481055", "31322425", "31305371", "31305370", "30896746", "31417414", "31046010", "30758869", "30893893", "30820178", "30632422", "30308528", "30785765", "30742257", "28704315", "31539053", "30449281", "30415644", "30422016", "30336491", "29624522", "30205762", "30119761", "29933113", "29757049", "30104487", "29752954", "29771168", "30029584", "30008240", "29976877", "29405793", "29860237", "29607594", "29773536", "29506013", "29205517", "29409520", "29252050", "29023359", "28530498", "28723842", "28847532", "29135634", "29027102", "28737524", "27721026", "28886821", "28831686", "27367601", "28721562", "28685512", "28368518", "28290159", "28213754", "28213614", "28164451", "28057770"], "label": "0"}

Hot flushes are the core symptoms that reflect the brain's response to the changing hormonal milieu of the menopause transition, particularly to the rapidly fluctuating and falling levels of estradiol. The physical symptoms of hot flushes and the associated changes in sleep, mood, and cognition will lead many women to seek medical care. It is critical to understand the interrelationship of hot flushes and other neuropsychological symptoms of the menopause transition so that treatment priorities can be established. For example, if sleep disruption explains most daytime neuropsychological problems in women with hot flushes, treating insomnia should be considered a priority. Alternatively, mood, cognition, and quality of life may be disturbed independent of sleep problems. In such a situation, each symptom should be evaluated separately from any assessment of sleep. As recent data from the WHI establish the risks of long-term HRT use, concern about using HRT, even as a short-term intervention, has increased substantially. Although HRT remains the first-line treatment for hot flushes, the WHI findings have drawn attention to nonhormonal treatments of hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms. Growing evidence to support the efficacy of serotonergic antidepressants and other psychoactive medications in the treatment for hot flushes suggests that nonhormonal interventions will prove important alternatives to HRT. As further evidence of the benefits of psychoactive medications for menopausal symptoms is established, the choice between using hormonal and nonhormonal therapies for management of menopausal symptoms will continue to evolve.", "outbound_citations": ["12900318", "12783913", "12642637", "12642636", "12716252", "12679432", "12576259", "12435217", "12439097", "12459399", "12117397", "12106639", "12123333", "11896107", "11829697", "11810032", "11831612", "11788110", "11704104", "11386980", "11352967", "11306202", "11905764", "11255426", "11500997", "11201509", "11145492", "11133824", "11063896", "11006499", "10960625", "10942479", "10880548", "10869887", "10908824", "10819701", "10931767", "10805607", "10694559", "10867223", "10690382", "10581405", "10566644", "10450590", "10411797", "10076170", "11910664", "9799627", "9819782", "11907941", "9696230", "9643512", "9609575", "9576289", "9496988", "9491878", "9469333", "9238064", "9153161", "9152569", "9076645", "8844631", "8530596", "7547766", "7629229", "7599662", "8028614", "8055122", "8127335", "8270972", "8300981", "8456888", "1484915", "1508062", "1508061", "1658700", "2053622", "2616704", "3067252", "3148991", "3357653", "3429805", "3578449", "3784918", "3928674", "3161265", "7145250", "7218488", "6268783", "226735", "331844", "322905", "794882", "791587", "1234567", "13163372"], "inbound_citations": ["36576445", "31331546", "30182804", "30179986", "29452777", "29778129", "29200839"], "label": "0"}

(Marietta, Georgia), between 1989 and 1996 for Estratest and Estratest HS (half-strength). These oral esterified estrogens--methyltestosterone combination products have been marketed in the United States since 1964 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in patients whose symptoms have not been relieved by estrogens alone. Between 1989 and 1996, more than 1 million woman-years of exposure occurred. The safety profile contained in this paper is based on a cumulative total of 568 individual cases comprising 863 adverse events (AEs). The proportions of AEs associated with the use of Estratest (575 events; 66.6%) and Estratest HS (288 events; 33.4%) were commensurate with the proportions of individual reports of adverse experiences for the two formulations (369 reports [65.0%] and 199 reports [35.0%], respectively). The rank order and percentage of types of AEs reported were also similar. The cumulative volume of reports was relatively low given the extent of exposure. Despite the limitations inherent in spontaneous postmarketing surveillance, the safety profile derived from this assessment does not indicate a significant safety concern with Estratest or Estratest HS. No deaths were reported, and no adverse findings indicative of the need for more comprehensive surveillance or concern on the part of the medical community or consumers were observed. Reports of cancer, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic phenomena, and hepatic dysfunction were few and were assessed as not related to treatment with Estratest or Estratest HS; reports of drug overdose, drug-drug interaction, and birth defects were rare (4 of 863 events; 0.5%). The most commonly reported AEs were those known to be associated with estrogen therapy (weight gain, headache, nausea, and vasodilatation) and androgen treatment (alopecia, acne, and hirsutism). Twenty-three (4.0%) of the 568 cases reported had at least one event that was regarded as serious, and 53 (6.1%) of the total 863 AEs were regarded as serious. The findings indicate that Estratest and Estratest HS are safe when used as directed and that the marginal increase in risk associated with androgen coadministration can be managed with appropriate patient selection and monitoring, as stated in the package insert for these compounds.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31645570", "28442935"], "label": "0"}

Bilateral oophorectomy did not induce any significant modifications in the ECG parameters of the postmenopausal women whereas in the premenopausal women, we observed a significant increment in mean duration of the T wave, a significant decrease in its amplitude and significant reduction in ST depression in V2, V3, V4 and V5. The third ECG showed regression of the ECG modifications in Group A. In the women of Group B, the second and third ECGs were not substantially different, but there were statistically significant differences between the first and third ECGs. The results of the present study show that ovariectomy induces significant though not clinically evident modifications in resting ECG.

One hundred and sixty healthy, hysterectomized postmenopausal volunteers aged 40-60 years with serum estradiol levels < 20 pg/ml were started on treatment at four centers in The Netherlands. Every 6 months, bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine, non-dominant wrist and left hip, and markers of bone turnover were assessed in urine and serum. The treatment arms were: estradiol, 100 microg/day (E-100, n = 53), oestradiol, 50 microg/day (E-50, n = 54), placebo (P-100, placebo to E-100, n = 27 or P-50, placebo to E-50, n = 26). Treatment was continued for up to 2 years. After 24 months, BMD of the lumbar spine in the E-100 group differed by 7.7% [5.8-9.5%] (mean [95% confidence interval]) from the placebo group and showed a mean (s.e.m.) increase in BMD from baseline of 5.9% (0.69%). For the E-50 group the difference compared with placebo was 6.2% [4.4-8.0%] and the absolute increase was 4.5% (0.62%); in the placebo group, the absolute change was -2.3% (0.48%). In the total wrist, the changes were: E-100: difference compared with placebo 2.5% [1.5 3.6%], absolute increase 0.6% (0.3%); E-50: difference compared with placebo 2.9% [1.8-3.9%], absolute increase 0.7% (0.25%); and absolute change on placebo: -2.5% (0.35%).

The commercial availability of DHEA outside the regular pharmaceutical-medical network in the United States creates a real public health problem that may be resolved only by appropriate long-term clinical trials in elderly men and women. Two hundred and eighty healthy individuals (women and men 60-79 years old) were given DHEA, 50 mg, or placebo, orally, daily for a year in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. No potentially harmful accumulation of DHEAS and active steroids was recorded. Besides the reestablishment of a \"young\" concentration of DHEAS, a small increase of testosterone and estradiol was noted, particularly in women, and may be involved in the significantly demonstrated physiological-clinical manifestations here reported. Bone turnover improved selectively in women >70 years old, as assessed by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) technique and the decrease of osteoclastic activity. A significant increase in most libido parameters was also found in these older women. Improvement of the skin status was observed, particularly in women, in terms of hydration, epidermal thickness, sebum production, and pigmentation. A number of biological indices confirmed the lack of harmful consequences of this 50 mg/day DHEA administration over one year, also indicating that this kind of replacement therapy normalized some effects of aging, but does not create \"supermen/women\" (doping).", "outbound_citations": ["10502590", "10323374", "9799756", "9660430", "9253307", "8917605", "8889854", "8784058", "8772596", "8597452", "7515387", "8140939", "2139448", "2371166", "3069505", "6235241", "7442551", "14321064", "13463066", "10668635", "8943786", "PMC24107", "2976116"], "inbound_citations": ["36898260", "36750172", "36563520", "36423671", "36314292", "35960634", "35592515", "34781165", "34621900", "34242398", "34157116", "33739464", "33494482", "33553553", "33593962", "32853641", "32785663", "32785805", "32504237", "32016915", "33030737", "31663986", "31605389", "31779094", "31547021", "31271415", "30735720", "30314729", "31237150", "31190486", "30963138", "30229992", "29651863", "30342607", "30017799", "29971455", "29949623", "29932802", "29935982", "29678582", "29666146", "29378630", "30029723", "30029729", "28522341", "29410724", "28880846", "29264385", "28874721", "28797374", "28276592", "28300625", "28660183", "28264815", "28573064", "28573071", "28195079", "28211546", "28201987", "28212544", "28118059"], "label": "0"}

In study 1, 219 postmenopausal women reporting at least ten hot flushes per week were randomized to placebo or one of four treatment groups (0.2 mg norethindrone acetate/1 microg ethinyl E2, 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate/2.5 microg ethinyl E2, 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 microg ethinyl E2, or 1 mg norethindrone acetate/10 microg ethinyl E2).

The total duration of treatment was 16 weeks in study 1 and 12 weeks in study 2. In both studies, subjects reported in daily diaries whether they had either bleeding or spotting.

In time-dependent analyses adjusted for age, menopause type, and oral contraceptive use, ever use of estrogen only was significantly associated with ovarian cancer (rate ratio [RR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.0). Increasing duration of estrogen-only use was significantly associated with ovarian cancer: RRs for 10 to 19 years and 20 or more years were 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-3.0) and 3.2 (95% CI, 1.7-5.7), respectively (P value for trend <.001), and we observed a 7% (95% CI, 2%-13%) increase in RR per year of use. We observed significantly elevated RRs with increasing duration of estrogen-only use across all strata of other ovarian cancer risk factors, including women with hysterectomy. The RR for estrogen-progestin use after prior estrogen-only use was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.91-2.4), but the RR for estrogen-progestin-only use was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.64-1.7). The RRs for less than 2 years and 2 or more years of estrogen-progestin-only use were 1.6 (95% CI, 0.78-3.3) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.35-1.8), respectively, and there was no evidence of a duration response (P value for trend =.30).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWomen who used estrogen-only replacement therapy, particularly for 10 or more years, were at significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer in this study. Women who used short-term estrogen-progestin-only replacement therapy were not at increased risk, but risk associated with short-term and longer-term estrogen-progestin replacement therapy warrants further investigation.", "outbound_citations": ["12034072", "11941548", "11929950", "11943036", "11559549", "11513905", "11515643", "11255422", "11229598", "11108873", "10785567", "10695599", "10659874", "10507786", "10347991", "10074916", "10695959", "10318951", "9839517", "9721791", "9633841", "9554412", "9506768", "9170483", "9063344", "9769151", "8910636", "8712193", "8707404", "8664399", "7558414", "7717359", "8150532", "8375923", "1329996", "2589307", "2583865", "2679848", "3358417", "3329634", "6540687", "6578367", "6948131", "7304575", "6268273", "95735"], "inbound_citations": ["37065890", "35908135", "35982623", "35278635", "34964120", "34930450", "34773099", "34338690", "34325771", "34281275", "33935618", "33551166", "33014160", "32947880", "32150082", "31888819", "32065504", "32067992", "31849838", "31488422", "31271204", "31404281", "31118829", "31089333", "30890551", "30766462", "30607096", "30312977", "29890249", "30063119", "29772836", "28854867", "29493295", "31355356", "29387112", "29214773", "30216013", "28257827", "29054568", "28751268", "29104731", "28778332", "28444120", "28650869", "28443200", "28093732"], "label": "1"}

PRIMARY ENDPOINTS: Four endpoints were chosen to represent four biological systems related to the risk of cardiovascular disease: (1) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), (2) systolic blood pressure, (3) serum insulin, and (4) fibrinogen.\n\n\nANALYSIS\nAnalyses presented are by intention to treat. P values for primary endpoints are adjusted for multiple comparisons; 95% confidence intervals around estimated effects were calculated without this adjustment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean changes in HDL-C segregated treatment regimens into three statistically distinct groups: (1) placebo (decrease of 0.03 mmol/L [1.2 mg/dL]); (2) MPA regimens (increases of 0.03 to 0.04 mmol/L [1.2 to 1.6 mg/dL]); and (3) CEE with cyclic MP (increase of 0.11 mmol/L [4.1 mg/dL]) and CEE alone (increase of 0.14 mmol/L [5.6 mg/dL]). Active treatments decreased mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.37 to 0.46 mmol/L [14.5 to 17.7 mg/dL]) and increased mean triglyceride (0.13 to 0.15 mmol/L [11.4 to 13.7 mg/dL]) compared with placebo. Placebo was associated with a significantly greater increase in mean fibrinogen than any active treatment (0.10 g/L compared with -0.02 to 0.06 g/L); differences among active treatments were not significant. Systolic blood pressure increased and postchallenge insulin levels decreased during the trial, but neither varied significantly by treatment assignment. Compared with other active treatments, unopposed estrogen was associated with a significantly increased risk of adenomatous or atypical hyperplasia (34% vs 1%) and of hysterectomy (6% vs 1%). No other adverse effect differed by treatment assignment or hysterectomy status.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEstrogen alone or in combination with a progestin improves lipoproteins and lowers fibrinogen levels without detectable effects on postchallenge insulin or blood pressure. Unopposed estrogen is the optimal regimen for elevation of HDL-C, but the high rate of endometrial hyperplasia restricts use to women without a uterus. In women with a uterus, CEE with cyclic MP has the most favorable effect on HDL-C and no excess risk of endometrial hyperplasia.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36218064", "35969882", "35532850", "35675607", "35613189", "35331368", "35496275", "35357369", "35013031", "34996442", "35594463", "34668812", "34313617", "34130678", "34746830", "33399324", "33323763", "33165087", "32956009", "32874980", "32646459", "32556827", "32698992", "30576226", "30484736", "30477366", "30295082", "30671410", "29183775", "30322209", "30176849", "30130296", "29381666", "29531177", "29343929", "28846767", "28376274", "28533729", "28185712"], "label": "0"}

As the leading cause of disability and second cause of dementia, primary prevention should be the main way to fight the disease, since therapy is not efficient enough. Several observations pointed to estrogen as a protective agent that may reduce stroke risk, however, studies have shown conflicting data. There is no strong evidence that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases stroke risk. Several studies have shown that HRT may reduce the risk of fatal stroke. Conflicting results have been found for Alzheimer's disease and HRT as well. An association between higher serum concentration of estradiol and decreased risk of cognitive decline has been found in some studies, supporting the hypothesis that estrogen concentration may play a significant role in brain protection. Having in mind results of recent randomized trials, it is suggested that HRT should not be recommended on general basis for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases or for primary prevention of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Osteoporosis, cognitive decline and climacteric symptoms that are likely to impact on quality of life, speak in favor for recommendation of HRT use. On the other side, family history of breast carcinoma, mastopathy, thromboembolism, in certain cases gallbladder disease, will discourage the commencement of HRT.

The neurobiology of estrogen, particularly its neuromodulatory and neuroprotective actions, provide a viable basis to support such cognition-enhancing effects. We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group design pilot clinical study to evaluate the cognitive and neuroendocrine response to estrogen administration for postmenopausal women with AD. Twelve women with probably AD of mild-moderate severity completed the study. During an eight week treatment period, six women received 0.05 mg/day dosage of 17 beta-estradiol via a skin patch and the remaining six wore a placebo skin patch. Subjects were randomized to equal distribution, and evaluated at baseline, at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8 on treatment, and at weeks 9, 10, 11, and 13 off treatment. On each day of evaluation, cognition was assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests, and blood samples were collected to measure plasma concentrations of estradiol and estrone. In addition, several neuroendocrine markers were measured in plasma to evaluate the relationship between estrogen-induced cognitive effects and fluctuations in the catecholaminergic and insulin-like growth factor systems. Significant effects of estrogen treatment were observed on attention (i.e. Stroop: number of self-corrections in the Interference condition, F[1,8] = 8.22, P < 0.03) and verbal memory (i.e., Buschke: delayed cued recall, F[3,30] = 4.31, P < 0.02). The salutary effects of estrogen on cognition were observed after the first week of treatment, and started to diminish when treatment was terminated. For women treated with estrogen, enhancement in verbal memory was positively correlated with plasma levels of estradiol (r = 0.96, P < 0.02) and negatively correlated with concentrations of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in plasma (r = -0.92, P < 0.03). Furthermore, a trend in the data was evident to suggest a negative relationship between plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and verbal memory (r = -0.86, P = 0.06). Estrogen administration suppressed peripheral markers of the IGF system, as evidenced by a negative correlation between plasma concentration of estradiol and IGF-1 (r = -0.93, P < 0.03), and a trend for a similar relationship between plasma levels of estradiol and IGFBP-3 (r = -0.86, P = 0.06). With respect to the catecholamines assayed, norepinephrine was positively correlated with verbal memory (r = 0.95, P < 0.02) for women who were treated with estrogen. Furthermore, there was a trend to suggest a negative relationship between plasma epinephrine levels and the number of errors committed on a test of attention (r = -0.84, P = 0.07). In the placebo group, no significant effects of estrogen replacement were evident either on measures of cognition or on any of the neuroendocrine markers. The results of this study suggest that estrogen replacement may enhance cognition for postmenopausal women with AD. Furthermore, several markers of neuroendocrine activity may serve to index the magnitude of estrogen-induced facilitation on cognition. In addition, research findings from the present study will provide important information for the design of larger prospective clinical studies that are essential to definitively establish the therapeutic role of estrogen replacement for postmenopausal women with AD.", "outbound_citations": ["9732206", "9595966", "9566385", "9496988", "9344405", "9235959", "9191758", "9153161", "8709781", "8865203", "8675940", "8844880", "8920174", "8636278", "7606287", "8080389", "8528351", "8030628", "7925761", "7521856", "8252746", "7690364", "1484915", "1484916", "2062728", "3067252", "3786638", "3088024", "3012339", "6610841", "6298669", "738230", "639260", "1202204", "1164215", "5662937"], "inbound_citations": ["36834617", "36512265", "36447434", "35977664", "35616610", "35131314", "34803659", "34538724", "34342861", "34342862", "32960852", "32893509", "31744009", "30569086", "30104506", "29151229", "26891883", "28625273", "28297591"], "label": "0"}

No modifications of both urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and plasma osteocalcin levels were observed in calcium and in CE-treated women, while vertebral bone density significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) in both groups. In IP or IP + CE-treated women, plasma osteocalcin did not show any modification, while urinary hydroxyproline showed a significant (P < 0.05) decrease, that paralleled a significant (P < 0.05) increase in vertebral bone density. Postmenopausal IP administration, at the standard dose of 600 mg/day, can prevent the increase in bone turnover and the decrease in bone density that follow ovarian failure. The same effect can be obtained with the combined administration of low dose (400 mg/day) IP with low dose (0.3 mg/day) CE.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35565680", "33969554", "32824177", "31453136"], "label": "1"}

After a 4-week, treatment-free period, each woman received a continuous regimen of either one E2 transdermal system, two E2 transdermal systems, or placebo transdermal system(s) applied every week for 12 weeks. Efficacy was measured as reduction in hot flush frequency, determined from subject diaries. To measure local tolerance, skin irritation (erythema and edema) was objectively and systematically evaluated under blue light after removal of the transdermal system(s). Serum E2 and estrone concentrations were determined in one of the studies during baseline and on days 1, 9, 30, 58, 79, and 84. Mean hot flush frequency decreased from 80 hot flushes per week at baseline to approximately 13 hot flushes per week (84% decrease) after 12 weeks of transdermal E2 treatment. Compared with placebo, the decrease in hot flush frequency was significant as early as weeks 2 and 3, and was maintained through the end of the study. Few clinically significant skin reactions occurred, and only nine (3%) of the subjects withdrew because of a skin effect. After initial increase, serum E2 concentrations remained stable throughout the study, achieving values of approximately 20 and 40 pg/mL above baseline for one and two E2 transdermal systems, respectively. The E2 transdermal system effectively reduced the frequency of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms as early as the second week of therapy and was very well tolerated. The decrease in hot flush frequency was similar to that reported for oral and other transdermal estrogens, but at lower serum E2 concentrations.

Mean age was 66.7 years.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nEither 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n = 1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the end of 3 years.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.38).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDuring an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD. However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to continue.", "outbound_citations": ["10483976",

Several factors may increase fracture risk, among them reduced bone mineral density (BMD), increased bone resorption, microarchitectural deterioration of bone, increased fall risk, and decreased muscle strength. We have previously reported that PvuII polymorphism of the estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER \u03b1) gene is associated with bone loss rate, fracture risk, and response to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in early postmenopausal Finnish women. METHOD. We studied the influence of the ER\u03b1 genotype on fall risk and muscle strength in a 5-year randomized HRT trial of 331 early postmenopausal women (subgroup of the population-based OSTPRE study, Kuopio, Finland). A 5-year postal inquiry in May 1994 included questions on falls during the previous 12 months. Grip strength was measured with dynamometer. The ER\u03b1 gene polymorphism was analysed using PCR and PvuII restriction enzyme digestion. RESULTS. In all, 97 out of the 331 women reported falls. Half of those (56%) were slip falls, mostly during the winter season. In the HRT group, the ER\u03b1 genotype was associated with fall risk (P = 0.002, logistic regression). The risk of falls (RR) was higher in women with the PP genotype than in those with the Pp (RR = 5.26, 95% CI 1.98-13.94, P = 0.001) or the pp (RR = 3.84, 95% CI 1.46-10.12, P = 0.007) genotype. When the falls were divided into slip (environment-related) and non-slip (endogenous) falls, the non-slip falls were associated with the genotype (P = 0.004), but the slip falls were not so clearly (P = 0.061). When all falls and non-slip falls were adjusted to the number of chronic health disorders and the variable time-since-menopause, the difference between the genotypes persisted (P = 0.003 and P = 0.010, respectively). In the non-HRT group, the ER\u03b1 genotype was not associated with fall risk. The baseline or the 5-year grip strength values were not influenced by the ER\u03b1 genotype. In conclusion, ER \u03b1 polymorphism is associated with fall risk, especially with non-slip falls, in early postmenopausal Finnish women during the HRT. We have previously reported that, during HRT, women with the P allele have decreased fracture risk and that they may preferentially derive benefit from the positive effect of HRT on BMD. This suggests that the influence of ER\u03b1 polymorphism may depend on the target tissue (bone versus the nervous system). CONCLUSIONS. In these early postmenopausal, non-osteoporotic and relatively healthy women, the increased fall risk associated with the PP genotype was not associated with increased fracture risk, possibly due to improved bone strength during the HRT although falls generally predispose to fractures.", "outbound_citations": ["11413078", "11422111", "11377830", "11232022", "11181507", "11127213", "10703934", "11074057", "10558867", "10522952", "10469287", "10368772", "10022414", "9915372", "9860300", "9718201", "9661591", "9600083", "9556070", "9405729", "9253321", "9100562", "8976803", "8889854", "8757153", "8526937", "8619384", "7862179", "7832601", "7754811", "8231907", "1534476", "1952469", "1939527", "3624485"], "inbound_citations": ["32076017"], "label": "0"}

Design: Randomised, double blind comparison. Setting: Seven group practices in the Medical Research Council's general practice research framework. Subjects: 321 women with hysterectomy aged 35-59. Interventions: Hormone replacement therapy with (a) conjugated equine oestrogen 625 \u00b5g daily alone or (b) conjugated equine oestrogen 625 \u00b5g daily plus the progestogen norgestrel 150 \u00b5g daily for the last 12 days of the \u201ccycle.\u201d Main outcome measures: Changes in blood pressure, weight, symptoms, and haemostatic and lipid values. Results: After two years 36% (57/158) of women randomly allocated to take oestrogen alone had discontinued treatment as compared with 30% (49/163) of women allocated to take oestrogen plus progestogen. Smokers were more likely to withdraw than non-smokers. There were no clear differences between the two groups in symptoms often attributed to hormone replacement therapy or in blood pressure or weight. At one year low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations had fallen substantially in both groups. High density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations rose to significantly higher values in women taking oestrogen alone compared with those taking oestrogen plus progestogen, though triglyceride concentrations and factor VII activity were also significantly higher in this group. Fibrinogen concentration tended to fall, though not significantly, in both groups, possibly more in women taking oestrogen alone. Conclusions: Oestrogen plus progestogen was no less well tolerated than oestrogen alone. There was a fairly even balance between possibly beneficial and adverse effects of the two regimens on lipid concentrations and coagulability. Concern that the combined regimen may not have the cardioprotective effects ascribed to oestrogen alone can to some extent be allayed, with reassurance for the growing numbers of women with intact uteri using the combined regimen. Misgivings about the combined regimen in women with hysterectomy on the grounds of its acceptability and its effects on lipid values may also be unfounded. Key messages Key messages In fact, in hysterectomised women norgestrel containing hormone replacement preparations may be as well tolerated as unopposed oestrogen There may be little difference between norgestrel containing hormone replacement therapy and oestrogen only preparations in their lipid and haemostatic effects Pending the results of clinical end point trials, anxieties about the metabolic effects of norgestrel in hormone replacement therapy can largely be allayed", "outbound_citations": ["2875280", "3626001", "1847582", "1826173", "2059689", "1681213", "1681380", "1310024", "1789804", "1419993", "1333098", "1450872", "4337382", "7438421", "6784816", "8384316", "8486779", "8388207", "8215723", "8274478", "8274890", "1342259", "8030688", "8052956", "7922291"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

However, in the hormone group, findings did suggest a higher risk of CHD events during the first year, and a decreased risk during years 3 to 5.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine if the risk reduction observed in the later years of HERS persisted and resulted in an overall reduced risk of CHD events with additional years of follow-up.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nRandomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 4.1 years' duration (HERS) and subsequent unblinded follow-up for 2.7 years (HERS II) conducted at outpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 2763 postmenopausal women with CHD and average age of 67 years at enrollment in HERS; 2321 women (93% of those surviving) consented to follow-up in HERS II.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nParticipants were randomly assigned to receive 0.625 mg/d of conjugated estrogens and 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 1380), or placebo (n = 1383) during HERS; open-label hormone therapy was prescribed at personal physicians' discretion during HERS II. The proportions with at least 80% adherence to hormones declined from 81% (year 1) to 45% (year 6) in the hormone group, and increased from 0% (year 1) to 8% (year 6) in the placebo group.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular events were coronary revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina or congestive heart failure, nonfatal ventricular arrhythmia, sudden death, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no significant decreases in rates of primary CHD events or secondary cardiovascular events among women assigned to the hormone group compared with the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, or overall. The unadjusted relative hazard (RH) for CHD events in HERS was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-1.22); HERS II, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.77-1.29); and overall, 0.99 (0.84-1.17). The overall RHs were similar after adjustment for potential confounders and differential use of statins between treatment groups (RH, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.82-1.14), and in analyses restricted to women who were adherent to randomized treatment assignment (RH, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLower rates of CHD events among women in the hormone group in the final years of HERS did not persist during additional years of follow-up. After 6.8 years, hormone therapy did not reduce risk of cardiovascular events in women with CHD. Postmenopausal hormone therapy should not be used to reduce risk for CHD events in women with CHD.", "outbound_citations": ["12090863", "11864918", "11741368", "11680444", "11578152", "11559288", "11497535", "11905727", "11521117", "11507320", "11468217", "11485503", "11451256", "11401611", "11401615", "11388817", "11357157", "11331055", "11180734", "11156873", "11172164", "11172156", "11119402", "11056097", "10954759", "10922429", "10872009", "11131760", "10787361", "10429591", "10376571", "10335731", "9747868", "9875874", "9840563", "9718051", "9683309", "9568500", "9492970", "9616745", "9256219", "9187066", "9081000", "9439752", "8855852", "8855854", "8855853", "8629615", "8892713", "7824251", "8205277", "8421460", "1443971", "1308662", "1506812", "1872493", "2179590", "3568321", "3782631", "323705"], "inbound_citations": ["37244995", "37193125", "36931498", "36563785", "36463203", "36304545", "36200708", "36212662", "36157470", "36032780", "35872979", "35845134", "35699818", "35652344", "35414644", "35271863", "35209739", "35175845", "35175843", "35013031", "34874016", "34736577", "34694318", "34977714", "34650448", "34380572", "33895548", "33858012", "33835724", "33819637", "33722365", "33763598", "33763598", "33506261", "34104397", "33244065", "33165087", "33037943", "32893509", "32747311", "32642851", "32618512", "33384533", "32556827", "32535100", "32574829", "32670662", "32450447", "32374520", "32345788", "32228557", "32150082", "32019227", "31995690", "31934948", "32345788", "31852195", "31704553", "31500138", "31322425", "31156557", "31148480", "30363012", "30899074", "30819373", "30106241", "31753145", "31629918", "29437011", "30216118", "30192631", "30464071", "30358724", "30350133", "30178425", "30135334", "30010821", "30278955", "29858704", "29858147", "29671495", "29614498", "29449137", "29438272", "29518141", "29471698", "29628610", "29468912", "29437116", "32149188", "29234779", "29234780", "29763969", "30051413", "28697043", "29299128", "29149179", "29259504", "29065927", "28863328", "28797374", "28625396", "28728686", "28739806", "28704447", "28457941", "28759918", "28540770", "28476121", "28119050", "28428055", "28233240", "27676631", "28565968", "27964943", "27369115", "28093732", "28286839", "28042727", "27957792"], "label": "1"}

Twenty-two postmenopausal women, age range 51-57, were randomised to a 6 months single blind interventional study treatment with either continuous combined oestradiol plus norethisterone acetate, or tibolone. Computerised psychological test of memory, mood and libido were administered both before and at the end of the 6 months treatment. Fourteen patients completed the study; eight on Livial and six on Kliogest. Recognition memory was improved by Kliogest but not by Livial (P<0.05) while either drug equally improved both the reaction time (P<0.01) and accuracy of performance (P<0.001) of categorical semantic memory. Both the treatments improved libido significantly (P<0.05), while the mood did not change with either.

Sixty-six adult hypogonadal men (22-65 years of age) were withdrawn from prior i.m. treatment for 4-6 weeks and then randomly assigned to treatment with TTD (two 2.5-mg systems applied nightly) or i.m. (200 mg injected every 2 weeks); there were 33 patients per group. Twenty-six patients in the TTD group and 32 in the i.m. group completed the study. TTD treatment produced circadian variations in the levels of total T, bioavailable T, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol within the normal physiological ranges. i.m. treatment produced supraphysiological levels of T, bioavailable T, and estradiol (but not dihydrotestosterone) for several days after each injection. Mean morning sex hormone levels were within the normal range in greater proportions of TTD patients (range, 77-100%) than i.m. patients (range, 19-84%). Both treatments normalized LH levels in approximately 50% of patients with primary hypogonadism; however, LH levels were suppressed to the subnormal range in 31% of i.m. patients vs. 0% of TTD patients. Both treatments maintained sexual function (assessed by questionnaire and Rigiscan) and mood (Beck Depression Inventory) at the prior treatment levels. Prostate-specific antigen levels, prostate volumes, and lipid and serum chemistry parameters were comparable in both treatment groups. Transient skin irritation from the patches was reported by 60% of the TTD patients, but caused only three patients (9%) to discontinue treatment. i.m. treatment produced local reactions in 33% of patients and was associated with significantly more abnormal hematocrit elevations (43.8% of patients) compared with TTD treatment (15.4% of patients). Gynecomastia resolved more frequently during TTD treatment (4 of 10 patients) than with i.m. treatment (1 of 9 patients). Although both treatments seem to be efficacious for replacing T in hypogonadal men, the more physiological sex hormone levels and profiles associated with TTD may offer possible advantages over i.m. in minimizing excessive stimulation of erythropoiesis, preventing/ameliorating gynecomastia, and not over-suppressing gonadotropins.", "outbound_citations": ["9589821", "9497881", "9402072", "9177359", "8989221", "8626843", "8627833", "7705324", "1400877", "1740497", "1727832", "1942342", "1908485", "1908484", "2112162", "2493029", "2644756", "6862037", "6922469", "6800853", "6777395", "447801", "13688369", "13489253"], "inbound_citations": ["37109736", "36977023", "36309421", "36309423", "35428426", "35467476", "35389932", "35216723", "34743411", "34694927", "34510812", "34646669", "34370516", "33866902", "33471082", "33504130", "34396893", "33317996", "33202261", "33035607", "33173622", "33003070", "32744998", "32307242", "32237098", "32068334", "31988219", "31595418", "31099174", "31679721", "31156000", "30699978", "30156120", "30057139", "29602229", "29446829", "29542875", "29367424", "29436172", "29172848", "29205178", "28606866", "28526632", "28472278", "28192104", "27084565"], "label": "0"}

Thirty-nine patients were randomly allocated to either of the two treatments. Replens was given three times a week during the 12 weeks of the study, while Dienoestrol was administered daily during the first 2 weeks and thereafter three times a week. Vaginal dryness index, itching, irritation, dyspareunia, pH and safety were evaluated every week the first month and every month thereafter. Both treatments had a significant increase on vaginal dryness index as soon as the first week of treatment, and the hormonal compound was significantly better than the non-hormonal one. All symptoms such as itching, irritation and dyspareunia significantly decreased or disappeared without any difference between the two treatments. For pH, no significant difference was seen either in each group or between the two groups. No adverse events related with the two drugs were found. This study shows that Replens applied vaginally three times a week, is a full therapy for all symptoms of vaginal atrophy as well as local estrogen. No serious adverse event was related. Replens is an alternative treatment to local estrogen and perhaps a good complement of systemic HRT in patient suffering from vaginal dryness.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37019140", "37122641", "36435612", "36247008", "35854417", "35930822", "35353163", "35534426", "35316932", "36194923", "34602171", "34703415", "33858012", "33716979", "33307219", "32852449", "36446564", "32893511", "32021117", "31613827", "31473229", "31794500", "31698888", "31152747", "31279445", "31228541", "31291563", "31090555", "31080791", "30677065", "28641524", "31151570", "30085982", "29738424", "30244644", "30103082", "30051202", "29762200", "29733783", "29554173", "29554180", "29534246", "28843942", "27545107", "28625396", "30895225", "28056209", "27876429"], "label": "0"}

This was an open, randomised, parallel-group, multi-centre clinical trial, performed in six European countries. A total of 143 healthy menopausal women were allocated to treatment with Oesclim 50 and 140 to Estraderm TTS 50. The transdermal systems were applied twice weekly for 24 days out of each 28-day cycle, over a period of four cycles. Oral progestogen treatment was taken by non-hysterectomised patients for the last 12 days of estrogen therapy in each cycle. The local skin tolerability of the Oesclim 50 transdermal system was significantly better than that of Estraderm TTS 50. In the Oesclim 50 group, 4.2% of applications caused a reaction, compared with 9.5% in the Estraderm TTS 50 group (P < 0.001). Safety assessments showed both treatments to be well tolerated. Seven patients in the Oesclim 50 group, and 12 in the Estraderm TTS 50 group, discontinued due to adverse events. Of these discontinuations, one (0.7% of patients) in the Oesclim 50 group and seven (5.1% of patients) in the Estraderm TTS 50 group were due to application site reactions (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the percentage of patients with signs of hyperestrogenism (29 patients (20.3%) in the Oesclim group and 28 patients (20.0%) in the Estraderm TTS 50 group). Adhesion was significantly better for the Oesclim 50 transdermal system, with 6.0% of Oesclim 50 applications becoming detached compared with 11.3% of Estraderm TTS 50 applications (P < 0.001). The greater adhesion of Oesclim 50 was particularly apparent when the systems were exposed to water, with three times fewer Oesclim 50 systems becoming detached during a shower or bath (P < 0.001 in each case). Both treatments produced significant and comparable improvements in vasomotor symptoms, other menopausal symptoms and gynaecological assessments. A near-maximal effect on vasomotor symptoms was observed after approximately 1 month of treatment, and was maintained for the entire treatment period. Overall, Oesclim 50 provided statistically significantly better local skin tolerability and adhesion than Estraderm TTS 50, together with comparable efficacy and safety.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37109736", "28540770"], "label": "0"}

In the first study 65 women, unexposed to estrogen (-E study), age 70.8 +/- 0.8 years (mean +/- SEM) were all treated with calcium (Ca) 1.0-1.2 g daily and ergocalciferol (D) 0.25 mg per 25 kg once weekly and were randomly assigned to cyclical NaF (6 months on, 3 months off, initial dose 60 mg/day; group F CaD, n = 34) or no NaF (group CaD, n = 31). In the second study 34 patients, age 65.5 +/- 1.2 years, on hormone replacement therapy (E) at baseline, had this standardized, and were all treated with Ca and D and similarly randomized (FE CaD, n = 17; E CaD, n = 17) (+E study). The patients were stratified according to E status and subsequently assigned randomly to +/- NaF. Seventy-five patients completed the trial. Both groups treated with NaF showed an increase in lumbar spinal density (by DXA) above baseline by 27 months: FE CaD + 16.2% and F CaD +9.3% (both p = 0.0001). In neither group CaD nor E CaD did lumbar spinal density increase.

Differences between the two NaF groups were greatest at the total hip at 27 months but were not significant [p < 0.05; in view of the multiple bone mineral density (BMD) sites, an alpha of 0.01 was employed to denote significance in BMD changes throughout this paper]. Using Cox's proportional hazards model, in the -E study there were significantly more patients with first fresh vertebral fractures in those treated with NaF than in those not so treated (RR = 24.2, p = 0.008, 95% CI 2.3-255). Patients developing first fresh fractures in the first 9 months were markedly different between groups: -23% of F CaD, 0 of CaD, 29% of FE CaD and 0 of E CaD. The incidence of incomplete (stress) fractures was similar in the two NaF-treated groups. Complete nonvertebral fractures did not occur in the two +E groups; there were no differences between groups F CaD and CaD. Baseline BMD (spine and femoral neck) was related to incident vertebral fractures in the control groups (no NaF), but not in the two NaF groups.

Validated questionnaires [Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) index, Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ)] and Visual Analogue (VA) scales were used to assess the effects of the extract on QoL at baseline and after 16 weeks' treatment with either the ginseng extract or placebo. To assess the efficacy of ginseng on postmenopausal symptoms, physiological parameters [follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels, endometrial thickness, maturity index and vaginal pH] were recorded at the same time points. Of the 384 randomized patients (mean age 53.5 +/- 4.0 years), the questionnaires were completed by 193 women treated with ginseng and 191 treated with placebo. With regard to the primary endpoint (total score of the PGWB index) the extract showed only a tendency for a slightly better overall symptomatic relief (p < 0.1). Exploratory analysis of PGWB subsets, however, reported p-values < 0.05 for depression, well-being and health subscales in favor of ginseng compared with placebo.

The authors investigated the possible role of changes in gonadal steroid levels in postpartum depression by simulating two hormonal conditions related to pregnancy and parturition in euthymic women with and without a history of postpartum depression.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe supraphysiologic gonadal steroid levels of pregnancy and withdrawal from these high levels to a hypogonadal state were simulated by inducing hypogonadism in euthymic women-eight with and eight without a history of postpartum depression-with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprolide acetate, adding back supraphysiologic doses of estradiol and progesterone for 8 weeks, and then withdrawing both steroids under double-blind conditions. Outcome measures were daily symptom self-ratings and standardized subjective and objective cross-sectional mood rating scales.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive of the eight women with a history of postpartum depression (62.5%) and none of the eight women in the comparison group developed significant mood symptoms during the withdrawal period. Analysis of variance with repeated measures of daily and cross-sectional ratings of mood showed significant phase-by-group effects. These effects reflected significant increases in depressive symptoms in women with a history of postpartum depression but not in the comparison group after hormone withdrawal (and during the end of the hormone replacement phase), compared with baseline.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe data provide direct evidence in support of the involvement of the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone in the development of postpartum depression in a subgroup of women. Further, they suggest that women with a history of postpartum depression are differentially sensitive to mood-destabilizing effects of gonadal steroids.", "outbound_citations": ["9807639", "9435325", "8818365", "8598756", "8750040", "7608357", "7728362", "8199780", "8353695", "2005273", "2307763", "3167466", "3651732", "3651704", "3801360", "2941469", "6692075", "5750402", "13688369"], "inbound_citations": ["37099310", "37086330", "37068417", "37111278", "36969689", "36876646", "36782063", "36682313", "36645923", "36608082", "36720349", "36702402", "36539281", "36570542", "36585408", "36686097", "36433781", "36475229", "36316904", "36138128", "36182765", "36028806", "36029538", "35974667", "35811373", "35796680", "35809362", "35729864", "35680688", "35721155", "35777494", "35638179", "35532792", "35558166", "35398750", "35267252", "35257937", "35172727", "35143568", "35231418", "35147467", "35267252", "35115970", "34955718", "34865661", "34856750", "34833154", "34663459", "34613495", "34601300", "34533410", "34594247", "34607269", "34529602", "34589817", "34237800", "34171352", "34211407", "34462985", "34211295", "34034695", "34019980", "33945830", "33881600", "33905988", "33827361", "33919564", "33792735", "33774267", "33573787", "33486114", "33479202", "33459438", "33454978", "33393686", "33406713", "33407895", "33113391", "33585496", "33205315", "33248376", "33224470", "33196694", "33278766", "33036563", "33083624", "32931090", "32771399", "32750403", "32730861", "32666403", "33314049", "32607122", "32584616", "32723604", "32498541", "32505925", "32399989", "32250509", "32296356", "33162848", "32584002", "32008678", "32065252", "32435663", "32041121", "31987814", "31927022", "31910998", "32621974", "32841079", "32736761", "30723972", "31634680", "31871258", "31750916", "31705553", "31701847", "31709278", "31624929", "30452945", "31584571", "31323375", "31372757", "31246736", "31302763", "31078198", "31078195", "31242891", "31223544", "31275559", "29956632", "31039525", "30946828", "30872093", "30906252", "30894661", "30790145", "30777348", "30605874", "30419373", "30721749", "30268061", "30701996", "30195110", "30552910", "30561785", "30457060", "31447412", "30532739", "30283036", "30344172", "30029155", "29737006", "30581288", "30092921", "30092919", "30112671", "30094520", "30068423", "30061743", "29968131", "29804553", "29807325", "29695824", "29695991", "30766340", "29179143", "29485618", "29174274", "29146408", "30358719", "30414016", "30193707", "29115857", "29461168", "29350128", "28609392", "28992892", "29082433", "28889814", "28953785", "28068465", "28823105", "28619359", "28619476", "28527954", "28665044", "28477647", "28477650", "28530897", "28278440", "28478835", "28443697", "28290763", "28370307", "28221088", "28012870", "28098957", "28044059", "27870443"], "label": "0"}

Methods Forty-eight postmenopausal women were enrolled and prospectively randomized to receive either HRT or tibolone for 3 months. At the end of the 3-month period, quality of life measures were assessed using the Greene Climacteric Scale and attitudes of sexuality were evaluated using the McCoy Sex Scale. Results Based on subjective qualitative scores, tibolone treatment was at least as effective as continuous combined HRT in improving quality of life. It also effectively prevented withdrawal bleeding, which may occur during HRT use. Compared with continuous combined HRT, tibolone treatment was also associated with perceived improvement of sexual performance, including general sexual satisfaction, sexual interest, sexual fantasies, sexual arousal and orgasm, with decreased frequencies of vaginal dryness and painful intercourse. Conclusions The findings of this study indicate that both tibolone and continuous combined HRT have positive effects on the quality of life of Taiwanese postmenopausal women.

Dietary supplements containing isoflavones are widely used as alternatives to hormonal therapies for hot flashes, but there is a paucity of data supporting their efficacy.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of 2 dietary supplements derived from red clover with placebo in symptomatic menopausal women.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of menopausal women, aged 45 to 60 years, who were experiencing at least 35 hot flashes per week. The study was conducted between November 1999 and March 2001 at 3 US medical centers and included women who were recently postmenopausal (mean [SD], 3.3 [4.5] years since menopause) experiencing 8.1 hot flashes per day. Women were excluded if they were vegetarians, consumed soy products more than once per week, or took medications affecting isoflavone absorption.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nAfter a 2-week placebo run-in, 252 participants were randomly assigned to Promensil (82 mg of total isoflavones per day), Rimostil (57 mg of total isoflavones per day), or an identical placebo, and followed-up for 12 weeks.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nThe primary outcome measure was the change in frequency of hot flashes measured by participant daily diaries. Secondary outcome measures included changes in quality of life and adverse events.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 252 participants, 246 (98%) completed the 12-week protocol. The reductions in mean daily hot flash count at 12 weeks were similar for the Promensil (5.1), Rimostil (5.4), and placebo (5.0) groups. In comparison with the placebo group, participants in the Promensil group (41%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-51%; P =.03), but not in the Rimostil group (34%; 95% CI, 22%-46%; P =.74) reduced hot flashes more rapidly.

One hundred and seventy-one of them were given continuous solid matrix patch TTS 50 mg/day for 6 months. Sexual behaviour, menopausal symptoms and well-being were evaluated through a self-rating method. We used a structured questionnaire with three obligatory answers (less/same/more) for each question--sexual life, hot flushes, touchiness, insomnia, blood pressure, work willing, memory loss, well-being--filled in by the women themselves or by the medical equipe after a telephone interview.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy five per cent of women aged 51-53 and 84% aged 54-56, who had been treated for 6 months with TTS showed a fall of sexual drive, if compared with, respectively, 62% and 48% of untreated subjects. Relief of hot flushes, touchiness and insomnia occurred in 80% of treated women, with slight differences among the various groups while 61% showed increase of well-being.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of our study demonstrate that continuous TTS for 6 months decreased sexual drive in 69% of women, improved menopausal symptoms in 80% women but increased well-being only in 61% of women. These differences suggest that women's well-being does not seem linked only to the relief of menopausal symptoms and the impairment of their sexual life can play a negative role.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

In the Vit D group, the fracture incidence was non-significantly decreased (P = 0.229) in comparison with the placebo group.

After a month of run-in period, they received two different HRT regimen, either: (1) transdermal estradiol 50 mcg every 7 days for 28 days plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP) 10 mg/day from 15th to 28th day, or (2) oral conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg/day for 28 days plus MAP 10 mg/day for the last 14 days. Follow up evaluations were planned after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment. While we did not observe any significance change regarding headache parameters in ETTH patients during both transdermal and oral treatment, the course of migraine was significantly affected by the route of HRT. Both frequency of attacks (F = 8.5; P < 0.000) and days with headache (F = 6.9; P < 0.000) significantly increased during HRT in the subgroup assuming oral formulation. On the contrary, no changes in the same parameters were found in the group taking transdermal treatment. Moreover, while severity of migraine was unaffected by HRT, analgesic consumption was significantly increased in the subgroup on oral treatment (F = 6.3; P = 0.001). HRT significantly affects the course of headache in postmenopausal migraine sufferers. Indeed, while the clinical pattern of ETTH remained stable throughout the observational period, patients suffering from MwA worsened their symptoms within the first 3 months of treatment. In particular, the oral route of administration significantly worsened migraine in comparison to the transdermal route.", "outbound_citations": ["11279965", "10449117", "10372673", "10214539", "10487511", "9522321", "9058401", "9546870", "8528378", "8376100", "8412841", "1350073", "1727198", "2046918", "1941010", "2690635", "3283471", "3801360", "1003364", "1132989", "1167630", "5172957", "4938602", "5641438"], "inbound_citations": ["36081216", "35679008", "35456034", "34974967", "34073696", "33594921", "33158484", "32783644", "31151572", "30497379", "29904828", "29521155", "29508091", "28994639"], "label": "0"}

Fulvestrant (Faslodex((R)), ICI 182780, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals; Wilmington, Delaware) is a selective antagonist of estrogen designed to have no estrogenic effects. Lack of aqueous solubility led to the development of a parenteral formulation for monthly intramuscular administration. Fulvestrant has been shown to inhibit the proliferative effects of estrogen on sensitive tissues in vitro and in vivo, and is without apparent measurable estrogenic activity. The data upon which marketing approval for fulvestrant was based are summarized below. Eight hundred fifty-one postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer were enrolled in two phase III studies, 400 in a North American double-blind study and 451 in a European open-label study, comparing the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant with anastrozole. Four hundred twenty-eight patients were randomized to receive fulvestrant 250 mg monthly by intramuscular injection and 423 patients were to receive anastrozole 1 mg daily. Patients were considered hormone sensitive either by receptor status or previous response to endocrine therapy. Over 96% of patients had previously received tamoxifen, either in the adjuvant setting or as treatment for metastatic disease. The primary study end points were response rate and time to progression. Response rates for patients treated with fulvestrant were 17% and 20% in the North American and European trials, respectively, compared with 17% and 15% in the anastrozole treatment arms. There were no statistically significant differences in response rates, time to progression, or survival between treatment arms in either study. The most common adverse events attributed to the treatment (>10%) were injection-site reactions and hot flashes. Common events (1%-10%) included asthenia, headache, and gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), as well as rash and urinary tract infections. A small increase in joint disorders was reported in the anastrozole-treated patients. On April 25, 2002, fulvestrant 250 mg by monthly intramuscular injection was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy. Approval was based on similarity of response rates and time to progression between fulvestrant and anastrozole.", "outbound_citations": ["11402439", "10951345", "11031399", "9740079", "8683230"], "inbound_citations": ["37163948", "37146385", "36727068", "35917687", "35793750", "35584336", "35450488", "34780297", "34694932", "34651424", "34537452", "34451816", "34251202", "34026843", "33632029", "34659898", "33190190", "33138369", "32958261", "32968620", "32404196", "32265426", "32030569", "31004402", "30056727", "29783894", "29352052", "29522716", "29467940", "29061079", "29262607", "28684381", "28758424", "27696906"], "label": "0"}

Subjects were randomized to CBT or observation for 20 weeks. Serum levels of E(2) and P and vaginal bleeding were monitored. Of eight women treated with CBT, six resumed ovulating, one had partial recovery of ovarian function without evidence of ovulation, and one did not display return of ovarian function.

Thus, CBT resulted in a higher rate of ovarian activity (87.5%) than did observation (25.0%), chi(2) = 7.14.

Many women report using these therapies for menopausal symptoms (7, 8). A national magazine received more than 15 000 responses to a survey of alternative treatments for menopausal women (7). Primary symptoms included hot flashes, joint pain, sleep problems, forgetfulness, and fatigue; hot flashes (the most common menopausal symptom for women in the United States) (9) were most commonly treated. Therapies of choice were herbal remedies, chiropractic, and meditation. Recently, dietary supplements and foods containing phytoestrogens have become increasingly popular, despite the lack of data from clinical trials. The science of CAM therapies is still inadequate to sufficiently inform clinicians and the public of the benefits or potential risks of CAM therapies. To provide information for clinicians, we reviewed randomized, controlled clinical trials of CAM therapies for menopausal symptoms. Methods Study Selection We searched MEDLINE from January 1966 to December 2002, the Alternative and Complementary Database (AMED) of the British Library from January 1985 to December 2000, and our own extensive files. Databases were searched under the terms hot flash/flush, menopause, and climacteric, combined with phytoestrogens, alternative medicine, herbal medicine, traditional medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, naturopathy, chiropractic, osteopathy, massage, yoga, relaxation therapy, homeopathy, aromatherapy, and therapeutic touch. We did not limit the search to English-language literature. Studies that examined single symptoms or conditions that are not clearly associated with menopause (for example, anxiety and lipids) were excluded. All other randomized, controlled trials, regardless of their quality, were included. A total of 29 studies were identified. Each author extracted information on the number of patients, study design, outcome measures, and results for half the studies; the other author then checked results. Role of the Funding Source The funding source had no role in the design, conduct, analyses, or reporting of the study or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. CAM Therapies Herbal Remedies Herbs used in the United States for menopausal problems include black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa), chaste tree berry (Vitex agnus-castus), dong quai (Angelica sinensis), ginseng (Panax ginseng and other Panax species), evening primrose oil (Oenethera biennis), motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca), red clover (Trifolium pratense), and licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra). We identified 10 trials of herbs (Table 1) (10-19). Most studies found no significant changes in primary outcome measures. However, these studies were small, of short duration, and far from sufficient to yield definitive conclusions. Table 1. Herbs for Menopausal Symptoms The most studied and perhaps most popular herb is black cohosh, traditionally used by Native Americans for gynecologic and other conditions. Almost all clinical studies of black cohosh have used the standardized product Remifemin (GlaxoSmithKline, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania); however, the formulation and the dosage have changed over time. One of four randomized, controlled trials of black cohosh for hot flashes was placebo controlled (10), one used both a treatment and placebo control (12), and two were treatment controlled (11, 13). Three of the four trials found black cohosh to be beneficial for treating hot flashes. Neither the identity of active compounds nor the mechanism of action of black cohosh is known. Although formononetin, an estrogenic isoflavone, was reported to have been isolated from black cohosh extract (20), another study found no formononetin in black cohosh extract (21). In addition, a recent systematic examination of extracts of black cohosh collected from 13 locations in the eastern United States as well as Remifemin also found no formononetin in any sample (22). Thus, other compounds must be responsible for its biological activity. Small amounts of biochanin, another isoflavone, have been isolated from C. racemosa roots (23). Other candidates for the biological activity of black cohosh include triterpene glycosides, organic acids, and esters. Black cohosh is not usually used on a long-term basis, and no clinical trials have lasted for more than 6 months. This is of concern because women using this product for natural hormone replacement therapy may take it for years. There are no published data from human trials about long-term safety, particularly regarding endometrial or breast stimulation. Effects on vaginal epithelium are inconclusive; two of five randomized, controlled trials that examined estrogenic effect on vaginal epithelium reported a stimulatory effect (11, 12). In vitro and in vivo studies are not consistent or sufficient. Although black cohosh may be useful for menopausal symptoms, long-term use cannot be presumed to be safe until appropriate safety studies are conducted. Red clover contains the phytoestrogens formononetin, biochanin A, daidzein, and genistein (24). Two small, 3-month clinical trials conducted in Australia reported no significant benefit of red clover extract for hot flashes (14, 15) (Table 1). Several larger trials are in progress. Red clover, a Native American herb, has not been traditionally used on a long-term basis for hot flashes, and it is unknown whether long-term use would have an estrogenic effect on the breast or endometrium. Dong quai, a Chinese herb traditionally prescribed as a tonic for women, is most commonly used as part of a mixture. It is sold in the United States for use alone or as part of newly formulated, nontraditional herbal combinations. One trial of dong quai found no benefit for hot flashes (16) (Table 1). It would be valuable to study Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas, prescribed in accordance with TCM diagnostic methods. Dong quai does not contain the typically reported phytoestrogens, and the data on stimulation of estrogen receptorpositive breast cancer cells or binding to estrogen receptors (25, 26) are conflicting. Dong quai contains coumarins and can cause bleeding when administered concurrently with warfarin (27); the furocoumarins contained in dong quai can cause photosensitization (24). Oil of evening primrose, a good source of the prostaglandin E1 precursor -linolenic acid, was evaluated for hot flashes in one trial; no differences were found between a group of patients using evening primrose oil and a placebo group (17). Single-dose studies are difficult to evaluate when optimum dose and duration of treatments are unknown. Evening primrose oil is a benign treatment. Ginseng has been used as a tonic for centuries in Asia. One trial found no benefit of ginseng over placebo for menopausal symptoms and quality-of-life measures, although there were positive effects on mood (18). Case reports link ingestion of ginseng with postmenopausal bleeding (28, 29); one case of postmenopausal bleeding occurred after topical use of a ginseng-containing face cream (30). Ginseng also reduced the international normalized ratio in one patient receiving warfarin therapy (27). In summary, of the herbs that have been tested for hot flashes, only black cohosh has shown a beneficial effect. Questions remain about the long-term safety of most herbs. Dietary Phytoestrogens Many food plants contain phytoestrogens, primarily phenolic (rather than steroidal) compounds that include isoflavones, lignans, and coumestans. Isoflavone precursors are found in soy and other types of beans, clover, and alfalfa. Lignan precursors are found in whole grains, seeds (especially flaxseed [linseed]), fruits, vegetables, rye, millet, and legumes (31). Intestinal bacteria convert plant lignans to mammalian lignans (enterolactone and enterodiol) and convert conjugated isoflavones to unconjugated active isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and equol). Phytoestrogens are estrogenic, and, thus, diet may modulate endocrine actions in the body. High dietary intake of soy products in Japan, China, and Korea has been proposed as one reason for the lower prevalence of menopausal symptoms reported in those countries (32, 33). Soy foods have become popular in the United States for treating hot flashes, despite few strong supporting clinical studies. We identified 11 clinical trials that examined soy or isoflavone supplementation for hot flashes (Table 2) (34-44); one additional study of soy for menopausal women examined vaginal epithelium rather than hot flashes (45). Products studied ranged from soy foods to purified isoflavone preparations. Only 3 of 8 studies with treatment phases that lasted for more than 6 weeks showed significant improvement in hot flashes at the end of the study (35, 41, 43). The longest study to date showed no benefit for hot flashes (or other symptoms) at 24 weeks (36). Comparisons are difficult because of variations in product, dosage, scoring systems for symptoms of hot flashes, and the menopausal status of patients. Published data show only modest effects (primarily on the severity of hot flashes), and most benefits disappeared after 6 weeks (for hot flashes, even 3 months is barely adequate to appropriately assess efficacy). It is of interest that in most of these studies, symptoms decreased in all groupsoften as much as 50% to 60% in placebo as well as treatment groups. Studies of longer duration must be done to determine whether this placebo effect would have declined over time in any or all groups. Additional studies of menopausal symptoms are warranted to differentiate among whole foods, soy protein, and isoflavone extracts. Soy foods have been a staple in Asian cuisine for thousands of years and are presumed safe. Supplementing the diet with beans or bean products is a benign interve", "outbound_citations": ["12435217", "11864664", "11875334", "11809337", "12222669", "11896091", "11352967", "11201510", "11428178", "11245505", "10914616", "10746892", "10694559", "10675182", "10543679", "10432132", "11910672", "11910671", "10100174", "10761538", "9820257", "9674352", "9643756", "9492350", "9469333", "9464712", "11907915", "9418683", "9211472", "17252360", "8596318", "8997686", "7745019", "8136666", "8373645", "1497048", "1349965", "1656395", "1920178", "2197954", "3265758", "3189445", "2841818", "4070446", "6834589", "7191760", "664638", "13050216"], "inbound_citations": ["37222798", "36670902", "35550138", "35651836", "35307684", "34649685", "34390867", "33685833", "33665100", "32898024", "32147040", "31783026", "31740049", "31487580", "31866753", "31646139", "31328118", "30363012", "31001050", "30868921", "31146772", "31151569", "30646110", "30127828", "29599720", "29508091", "29595668", "28784591", "29230660", "29037637", "28399006", "28625396", "27875388", "27676631"], "label": "0"}

Group 1 (n = 21) was replaced transdermally following surgery for 3 weeks with estradiol patch 0.05 mg daily. Group 2 (n = 21) got no hormones.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGroup 1 had a remarkable decrease of estradiol after 10 days to 59% and after 6 weeks to 71% of the starting point. Gonadotropins showed an increase in this group. In group 2 without replacement there was only a small decrease of estradiol after 10 days and after 6 weeks the level was higher than before hysterectomy. Testosterone also decreased in group 1 to 64% of the level before surgery after 6 weeks, whereas in the comparing group it was 87%. On the other hand in group 1 only 2 of 21 women, but 10 of 21 in group 2 showed climacteric-like symptoms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHRT over 3 weeks induces ovarian suppression, which is still seen 6 weeks after hysterectomy.

A calcium supplement of 600 mg nocte was given to only those women who had a daily calcium intake of less than 1 g per day at baseline, as assessed by recalled dietary intake. There was a significant decrease [0.74 (+/- 0.35 SD) to 0.58 (+/- 0. 22), Dalpha = -0.17 (+/- 0.26), p<0.0005] in alpha at 8 months compared with baseline in the HRT-treated group, but a significant increase [0.68 (+/- 0.31) to 0.84 (+/- 0.27), Dalpha = +0.16 (+/- 0. 30), p<0.003] in the HRT-plus-calcitriol treated patients, resulting in alpha being significantly higher after 8 months in the latter group than in the HRT-only group. Although 72% of the patients had been supplemented with calcium between the first and second studies, separate analyses revealed that the change in calcium intake had not affected the result. Further breakdown of the groups into baseline 'normal' absorbers (alpha >/=0.55) and 'malabsorbers' (alpha <0.55) revealed that alpha decreased with HRT treatment only in the normal absorbers, and remained stable in the malabsorbers. Conversely, following HRT plus calcitriol treatment, alpha increased only in the malabsorbers, the normal absorbers in this group remaining unchanged. In conclusion, our data show that HRT, of the type and dose used in this study, did not produce an increase in absorption efficiency; it was in fact associated with a fall. Increased absorption efficiency cannot be achieved unless calcitriol is used concurrently, and then only in patients with malabsorption. Calcitriol also had a significant effect in normal absorbers in that it prevented the decline in alpha seen with HRT alone, and thus should be considered in all patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with HRT.", "outbound_citations": ["9192503", "8989271", "8530583", "7785459", "8076583", "8076582", "1320048", "1729617", "1922205", "1785377", "2028834", "2229286", "2364565", "2325571", "2816496", "2913914", "2915093", "3076047", "3335630", "3838358", "6606522", "6291391", "6255005", "7428287", "7370532", "1100130", "4847249", "4548006", "5470432"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

In addition to being a risk marker for cardiovascular disease, much recent data suggest that C-reactive protein (CRP) promotes atherogenesis via effects on monocytes and endothelial cells. The metabolic syndrome is associated with significantly elevated levels of CRP. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a marker of atherothrombosis, is also elevated in the metabolic syndrome and in diabetes, and endothelial cells are the major source of PAI-1. However, there are no studies examining the effect of CRP on PAI-1 in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Methods and Results\u2014Incubation of HAECs with CRP results in a time- and dose-dependent increase in secreted PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity, intracellular PAI-1 protein, and PAI-1 mRNA. CRP stabilizes PAI-1 mRNA. Inhibitors of endothelial NO synthase, blocking antibodies to interleukin-6 and an endothelin-1 receptor blocker, fail to attenuate the effect of CRP on PAI-1. CRP additionally increased PAI-1 under hyperglycemic conditions. Conclusions\u2014This study makes the novel observation that CRP induces PAI-1 expression and activity in HAECs and thus has implications for both the metabolic syndrome and atherothrombosis.

The remainder had dilatation and curettage (n = 2) or hysterectomy with (n = 2) or without (n = 6) prior medical therapy, or refused further biopsies (n = 1). One woman developed adenocarcinoma of the endometrium while receiving placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAt a dosage of 0.625 mg, the daily administration of CEE enhanced the development of endometrial hyperplasia. Combining CEE with cyclic or continuous MPA or cyclic MP protected the endometrium from hyperplastic changes associated with estrogen-only therapy.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36820056", "36727752", "35438051", "34402360", "33841322", "33165087", "33095879", "32796289", "32781573", "31928575", "29889748", "28860416", "28454492"], "label": "0"}

Contribution The discontinuation phase of this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed loss of spine and trochanter bone mass in postmenopausal women 1 year after withdrawal of estrogen and no such loss after withdrawal of either alendronate or combination therapy with alendronate and estrogen therapy. Cautions The study was not large or long enough to show whether discontinuation of estrogen therapy is associated with more fractures than discontinuation of either alendronate or combination therapy. The Editors Several antiresorptive agents have been shown to increase bone mass and reduce osteoporotic fractures (1-3). Because greater improvements in bone mass in women using therapy are associated with greater reductions in fracture (4, 5), investigators have begun to examine combinations of antiresorptive therapies to achieve more substantial gains in bone mass. Lindsay and colleagues demonstrated that addition of alendronate to hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women resulted in greater increases in bone mass than did maintenance of estrogen therapy alone (6). We previously showed that administration of alendronate and estrogen for 2 years in postmenopausal women with low bone mass resulted in statistically significantly greater increases in bone mass at the lumbar spine and femoral neck than those seen in women taking either agent alone (7). Furthermore, combination therapy was safe and resulted in normal findings on histologic examination of bone. In clinical practice, a key concern is the potential for accelerated bone loss when antiresorptive therapy is discontinued. Approximately one third of women discontinue hormone replacement therapy within 1 year of initiation (8). Older studies have demonstrated significant losses in bone mass after discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy (9-11). In contrast, when therapy with oral alendronate, 10 mg/d, is discontinued after osteoporosis treatment, bone mass at the hip and spine are maintained for 1 year (12). However, no head-to-head comparison of hormone replacement therapy and alendronate or the combination of antiresorptive therapy after discontinuation has been done. In addition, future losses in bone mass when patients discontinue therapy must be considered in management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. We therefore sought to examine the rate of bone loss after discontinuation of 2 years of alendronate therapy, hormone replacement therapy, or combination therapy. A subset of participants continued to take combination therapy for a third year to determine whether prolonged therapy remained beneficial. Methods Study Participants Four hundred twenty-five postmenopausal women 42 to 82 years of age who had low bone mass were enrolled in a 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at 18 centers in the United States (7). Participants were recruited from clinics, private practices, newspaper advertisements, and targeted mailings. All participants who completed the initial study were asked to enroll in the 1-year extension. Participants were told that if they were taking active treatment, they might be randomly allocated to receive placebo or treatment for the third year and that if they were taking placebo, they would continue to do so. Entry criteria for the initial study are described elsewhere (7). All women had had hysterectomy and had a bone mineral density at the lumbar spine that was less than or equal to a T score of 2.0 SDs below the peak bone mass in young adults. Data on presence or absence of ovaries were not collected. Exclusion criteria were metabolic bone disease, a low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, use of medications known to affect bone turnover, renal insufficiency, severe cardiac disease, and recent major upper gastrointestinal disease. The institutional review board at each clinical site approved the extension protocol. After signing the extension consent form and undergoing baseline evaluation for the extension, participants were allocated to blinded treatment on the basis of their original treatment in the first 2 years of the study. The randomization process was centrally determined by a statistician; as in the initial study, treatment allocation was concealed. Design As described for the initial study at each center, patients were randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups: placebo (n = 50); alendronate, 10 mg/d (n = 92); conjugated estrogen, 0.625 mg/d (n = 143); or alendronate, 10 mg/d, plus conjugated estrogen, 0.625 mg/d (n = 140) (Figure 1). The conjugated estrogen used was Premarin (Wyeth-Ayerst, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). All women received calcium carbonate to provide 500 mg of elemental calcium daily. Figure 1. Design of original 2-year study and reallocation to extension phase for year 3. At the end of the second year, 244 of the 425 women (57%) continued in a 1-year extension of the study (Figure 1). Of these women, 28 who previously received placebo continued to do so. Women who were taking combination therapy were reallocated to continue taking combination therapy (n = 44) or switch to placebo (n = 41). In addition, 50 participants taking alendronate alone and 81 participants taking conjugated estrogen alone for the first 2 years were assigned to placebo for the third year. All patients and investigators remained blinded to medication allocation. Patients continued to receive calcium supplementation during the third year. Outcome Measures Women were examined at month 24 (baseline of the 1-year extension), month 30, and month 36. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, hip (femoral neck, trochanter, total hip), and total body were assessed by using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry with QDR-1000W, QDR-1500, or QDR-2000 series bone densitometers (Hologic, Inc., Bedford, Massachusetts). A standard phantom was used for cross-calibration at all sites. Serum and urine samples were also obtained at months 24, 30, and 36 for assessment of biochemical markers of bone turnover, namely bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary N-telopeptide cross-links of collagen type I, corrected for creatinine. Statistical Analysis We used SAS software, version 6.12, TSLevel 0060, PROCedureGLM (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) to analyze the data. The primary efficacy end point was the mean difference between groups in the percentage change in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine from month 24 to month 36. Secondary efficacy end points were the mean percentage changes in bone mineral density of the hip and total body and biochemical markers of bone turnover. Overall percentage changes from month 0 to 36 in spine, hip, and total-body bone mineral density were also analyzed. The prespecified analysis was based on an intention-to-treat approach. At study design, we prespecified that all patients who had a baseline measurement and at least one measurement during treatment would be included in the analysis according to the group to which they were randomly allocated. The missing data were approximated by carrying forward the last available value on treatment forward to the missing time point. No data from the original 2-year study were carried forward to the extension period for any assessment of change. Women who violated the protocol were excluded from analysis of biochemical markers, as previously reported (7). Between-group comparisons of bone mineral density and biochemical measures were made by using analysis of variance techniques, with treatment, center, and treatment-by-center as factors. The assumption of homoscedasticity for the analysis of variance model was assessed by using the Levene test, and the normality assumption was assessed by using the ShapiroWilk test (13). If the assumptions were violated, a nonparametric method was used to corroborate the parametric results. The Fisher exact test was used to compare treatment groups for the proportion of participants who exceeded predefined limits of change in laboratory safety variables (13). Power calculations based on estimated sample sizes of 56 and 84 participants in the alendronate/placebo and estrogen/placebo treatment groups, respectively, yielded an estimate of 92% power to detect a 1.5% difference between mean percentage changes from month 24 to month 36 in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine ( = 0.05, two-tailed test). As requested by the journal editors, data on bone mineral density were also analyzed by using a mixed-model analysis, and results of this analysis are presented. An appropriate curvilinear function was fitted to the actual data, and the function was estimated by using all data available across time points for each participant. A model that regressed bone mineral density versus log (month + 1) provided the appropriate fit for the 3-year data and was used to analyze these data. The variable log (month + 1) was used because log (month) is undefined when month is 0, and log (month + 1) yields the value 0 at baseline. The fitted values from the model were used to obtain the percentage change during the period of interest. Data on bone mineral density from the mixed-model analyses are presented unless otherwise specified. Role of the Funding Source Data were collected by investigators at each study site with the support of Merck Research Laboratories, Rahway, New Jersey. Analyses were performed by statisticians at Merck & Co., Inc. Data were interpreted by the authors, who submitted the manuscript for publication.

The sequential regimens provided effective scheduling of bleeding around the end of the progestogen phase. The continuous regimens were associated with irregular bleeding, which was rarely severe, and a gradually increasing incidence of amenorrhoea. With sequential or continuous therapy, bleeding was less severe at the lower dose of progestogen than at the higher dose. No endometrial hyperplasia was detected by biopsy in any treatment group. One serous endometrial carcinoma and one endometrial adenocarcinoma were detected. An endometrial thickness >5 mm did not predict the presence of hyperplasia at biopsy.

Major depression is also associated with typical sleep-endocrine changes, including enhanced activity of the HPA axis, while an influence of age and gender on these alterations is less clear. To test the hypothesis that after menopause sleep-endocrine alterations associated with major depression are accentuated, we examined the sleep EEG and nocturnal hormone secretion (ACTH, cortisol, GH, estradiol, LH, FSH, and leptin) in 16 drug-free female patients, mostly with the first episode of a major depressive disorder (seven pre- and nine postmenopausal subjects) and 19 female controls (10 subjects in the early follicular phase and nine postmenopausal subjects). Nocturnal cortisol secretion was increased in postmenopausal patients with depression, while a decrease was noted in postmenopausal controls. Sleep alterations typically associated with depression, namely a reduction in sleep continuity and slow wave sleep (SWS) and an increase in REM density, were prominent in post- but not in premenopausal patients. An inverse correlation was noted between the decline in SWS and sleep continuity and FSH secretion in patients with depression, suggesting a role of menopause for these sleep-endocrine alterations typically associated with major depression. In contrast, in premenopausal patients we noted primarily a shift in SWS and delta-EEG activity from the first to the second non-REM period, which was not related to age or hormone secretion. Though the relatively small number of subjects per group precludes a definitive conclusion, our data open up the possibility that the sleep-endocrine changes typically associated with major depression are most prominent in postmenopausal patients.

For men receiving T gel, circulating total T and estradiol (E(2)) were significantly raised compared with baseline, and a significant improvement in verbal memory was observed. For men receiving DHT gel, serum DHT levels increased and T levels decreased significantly compared with baseline, and a significant improvement in spatial memory was observed.

Further, our results suggest that aromatization of T to E(2) may regulate verbal memory in men, whereas nonaromatizable androgens may regulate spatial memory.", "outbound_citations": ["11823060", "11823063", "11585606", "11549629", "11524467", "11445632", "11513099", "11389183", "11238542", "11454321", "11134099", "11104644", "11113342", "11044578", "10987818", "10946892", "10689057", "10802033", "10931767", "10745058", "10762694", "10720024", "10662537", "10965504", "11061547", "10683408", "11056468", "10199429", "10590174", "10553690", "10450895", "10448199", "10341369", "10418985", "10199626", "10098219", "9799627", "9799629", "9729388", "9709942", "9699883", "9768677", "9344566", "9355037", "9177359", "9647934", "8675575", "8723131", "8558233", "7705324", "7802414", "8190445", "8037876", "7979239", "8136068", "7687444", "1484915", "1572948", "1611529", "2356006", "2298157", "3067252", "3202949", "7160922", "7070432", "7440090", "812160"], "inbound_citations": ["36017670", "35904217", "35487276", "33706960", "32250330", "31926079", "31943448", "31296441", "30929220", "30653980", "30811529", "31480979", "29338083", "29549390", "28863017", "28343938", "28472278", "28241356"], "label": "0"}

While low doses of estrogens (0.3 mg/day of conjugated estrogens) can counteract neurovegetative menopausal symptoms, higher doses (0.625 mg/day of conjugated estrogens) are required to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that ipriflavone, a non-hormonal isoflavone derivative, is effective in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ipriflavone and very low doses of equine conjugated estrogens on bone loss in early postmenopausal women. Eighty-three healthy postmenopausal women (50.3 +/- 0.7 years) were enrolled for this 1-year multicenter study. All subjects were randomly allocated to receive: double placebo (n = 24; group A), placebo plus conjugated equine estrogens 0.30 mg/day (n = 31; group B) or conjugated equine estrogens 0.30 mg/day plus oral ipriflavone 200 mg tris in die at meals (n = 28; group C), according to a double-masked design. Among women who completed the treatment period (valid completers), those of group A showed a progressive decrease in forearm bone density (FBD; measured by dual photon absorptiometry) that reached 1.7% after 12 months. The women in group B maintained their FBD in the first 6 months of treatment but, at the end of the study, showed a bone loss of 1.4% compared with basal values. By contrast, women in group C showed a significant increase in FBD after 1 year of treatment (+5.6%; p < 0.01). Both valid completers and intention to treat analyses revealed a significant difference (p < 0.05) between group A and group C over the study period. None of the treatments produced significant changes of biochemical markers of bone turnover, while hot flushes and other climacteric symptoms were significantly reduced after the sixth month of treatment in women receiving estrogens. Adverse events were generally mild, and did not differ among the groups. The results of this study suggest that low doses of estrogens combined with ipriflavone could represent a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of the postmenopausal syndrome.", "outbound_citations": ["1392261", "7866917", "8062153", "10147233", "8148667", "8377776", "8320424", "8420311", "8421079", "1491124", "1422320", "1450876", "1973969", "2322712", "2106931", "3597775", "3702590", "3951331", "6374537", "7312007"], "inbound_citations": ["35294490"], "label": "1"}

Bone mineral density measurements and endometrial and laboratory assessments were conducted every 6 months; plasma estradiol concentrations were measured after 12, 18, and 24 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll doses of esterified estrogens produced significant increases in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine compared with baseline and with placebo at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Mean plasma estradiol levels increased with esterified estrogens dose, and individual subject bone mineral density changes appeared related to plasma estradiol concentrations. Clinically relevant rates of endometrial hyperplasia were noted only in the groups receiving 0.625 and 1.25 mg of esterified estrogens daily. Lipid changes were dose related and apparent in all groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEsterified estrogens at doses from 0.3 to 1.25 mg/d, administered unopposed by progestin, produce a continuum of positive changes on bone and lipids. Plasma estradiol concentrations increased with esterified estrogens dose and were related to positive bone mineral densities.

This conclusion may not apply to women taking other estrogen and progestin formulations, as suggested by discrepancies in the findings of in vitro studies, epidemiological surveys and, mostly, in vivo studies of human breast epithelial cell proliferation showing opposite effects of HRT combining CEE plus MPA or estradiol plus progesterone. To evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with the use of the latter combination, commonly prescribed in France, a cohort including 3175 postmenopausal women was followed for a mean of 8.9 years (28 367 woman-years). In total, 1739 (55%) of these women were users of one type of estrogen replacement with systemic effect during at least 12 months, any time after the menopause, and were classified as HRT users. Among them, 83% were receiving exclusively or mostly a combination of a transdermal estradiol gel and a progestin other than MPA. Some 105 cases of breast cancer occurred during the follow-up period, corresponding to a mean of 37 new cases per 10 000 women/year. Using multivariate analysis adjusted for the calendar period of treatment, date of birth and age at menopause, we were unable to detect an increase in the relative risk (RR) of breast cancer (RR 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65-1.5) in the HRT users. The RR of breast cancer per year of use of HRT was 1.005 (95% CI 0.97-1.05).

The effect did not differ in women stratified by age, body mass index, smoking status, history of falls, personal and family history of fracture, total calcium intake, past use of hormone therapy, BMD, or summary fracture risk score. Total hip BMD increased 3.7% after 3 years of treatment with estrogen plus progestin compared with 0.14% in the placebo group (P<.001). The HR for the global index was similar across tertiles of the fracture risk scale (lowest fracture risk tertile, HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.93-1.58; middle tertile, HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.46; highest tertile, HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.88-1.24) (P for interaction =.54).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrates that estrogen plus progestin increases BMD and reduces the risk of fracture in healthy postmenopausal women. The decreased risk of fracture attributed to estrogen plus progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women examined. When considering the effects of hormone therapy on other important disease outcomes in a global model, there was no net benefit, even in women considered to be at high risk of fracture.", "outbound_citations": ["14762196", "12771112", "12090863", "12230356", "12117397", "11799954", "11401615", "11386929", "11331055", "11527048", "11386282", "10866867", "10527181", "10371229", "10320531", "10367027", "9875874", "9797485", "9718051", "9599190", "9492970", "9771869", "9158551", "8950879", "8537578", "8592956", "1502618", "1636840", "3818864", "7421945"], "inbound_citations": ["37056256", "37266568", "37255734", "37230869", "37011667", "36797788", "36749328", "36912327", "37218715", "36649902", "36700588", "36575344", "36562788", "36527508", "36357612", "36440439", "36382762", "36372197", "36318128", "36364772", "36398113", "36200398", "36280582", "36114901", "36163230", "36079860", "36035435", "35983518", "36007714", "36012916", "35833956", "35797481", "35763133", "35763073", "35949707", "35713694", "35774616", "35717745", "35662432", "35639106", "36065588", "35577424", "35577425", "35400590", "35080365", "35213517", "35938207", "34905877", "34739604", "34724173", "34448749", "34432008", "34414463", "34402365", "34240674", "34240673", "34645447", "34131304", "34119418", "33977831", "33950031", "33928827", "33901271", "33858012", "33754148", "33776942", "33795196", "33802713", "33716979", "33577971", "33495601", "33438038", "33444724", "33412129", "33450071", "33572979", "33297406", "33274517", "33213099", "33194005", "33045914", "33162933", "32976639", "32778934", "32893509", "32707115", "32700118", "32642851", "32622871", "32586953", "32612801", "32519298", "32510167", "32496996", "32427503", "32442476", "32272593", "32222607", "32229339", "32203407", "32168205", "32286708", "32040165", "32050822", "32004105", "31995690", "31954740", "31971344", "32406030", "31820174", "31792679", "31663769", "31680267", "31617425", "31378452", "31150870", "31423711", "30896746", "31172230", "30959188", "30907953", "31030207", "31009947", "31025211", "30963388", "30887607", "31453973", "30939537", "30796539", "30674078", "30624083", "30138538", "30449208", "30696576", "31685420", "31350204", "30489459", "31427058", "30456623", "30358733", "30328552", "30291494", "30449552", "30575489", "30325292", "30322209", "30192729", "30098758", "30037620", "29583083", "30154383", "29962257", "30166229", "30080660", "29855445", "29644763", "29671495", "29654947", "29636611", "29520604", "29358778", "29651313", "31355356", "29435281", "29257280", "29763969", "19112812", "28710257", "30505650", "28681147", "29234813", "28923411", "28960230", "28689769", "28551082", "28846767", "28872490", "28768649", "28797374", "28860416", "28805475", "28768651", "28366425", "28756709", "28650869", "28667435", "28664619", "28324062", "28498913", "28529739", "28612595", "28141663", "27801706", "28480658", "28301216", "28119100", "28281363", "28024091", "30775498", "28173850", "27693042", "28198975", "28093732", "27898259", "27820659", "28838768", "28686517"], "label": "1"}

Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Clinical research center, university hospital. Twenty women were randomized into protocol A or B, received either MPA or placebo along with GnRH-a, and were then crossed over at 12 weeks to placebo or MPA, for the final 12-week interval of GnRH-a therapy. Collection of serum and urine samples and measurement of bone density. Sex hormone, calcitropic hormone, and bone density studies were performed at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks. In both protocol A and B, LH and E(2) levels declined by 79%-81% and 83%-90% of the baseline, respectively, at 12 and 24 weeks. Serum Ca, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin; 2-h fasting and 24-h urinary Ca excretion; and urinary hydroxyproline levels all increased significantly during GnRH-a treatment alone. Estimated Ca balance decreased significantly during GnRH-a treatment alone. The addition of MPA attenuated the increases in phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and 2-h fasting and 24-h urinary Ca excretion, and the decrease in estimated Ca balance. Comparison of phase order demonstrated that MPA prevented 24-h urinary Ca excretion and urinary hydroxyproline loss and decline in estimated Ca balance when it was added back during the second 12 weeks (protocol B) but not during the first 12 weeks (protocol A).

For example, estrogen replacement improves verbal memory in women, and animal studies have shown effects of estrogen on hippocampal synaptogenesis and function. Little is known about sex steroid effects on other aspects of memory, such as frontal lobe-mediated working memory. We examined the relationships between working memory and sex steroid concentrations and whether sex steroid supplementation would modify age-related loss of working memory in older men and women. Before hormone supplementation, working memory, tested with the Subject Ordered Pointing Test (SOP), was worse in older subjects than younger subjects, and there was no evidence of gender differences at either age.

Background: Serum levels of total and bioavailable testosterone gradually decrease with age in men and are associated with reductions in muscle mass, osteoporosis, decreased sexual activity, and changes in cognition. Methods: Twenty-five healthy, community-dwelling volunteers, aged 50 to 80 years, completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants received weekly intramuscular injections of either 100 mg testosterone enanthate or placebo (saline) for 6 weeks. Cognitive evaluations were conducted at baseline, week 3, and week 6 of treatment by use of a battery of neuropsychologic tests. Results: Circulating total testosterone was raised an average of 130% from baseline at week 3 and 116% at week 6 in the treatment group. Because of aromatization of testosterone, estradiol increased an average of 77% at week 3 and 73% at week 6 in the treatment group. Significant improvements in cognition were observed for spatial memory (recall of a walking route), spatial ability (block construction), and verbal memory (recall of a short story) in older men treated with testosterone compared with baseline and the placebo group, although improvements were not evident for all measures. Conclusions: The results suggest that short-term testosterone administration enhances cognitive function in healthy older men. However, it remains unclear whether these improvements in cognition are attributable to increased testosterone or estradiol levels, or both. The potential role of testosterone vs its metabolites on cognition requires further research.", "outbound_citations": ["12573813", "10931767", "10745058", "10662535", "10662537", "10662536", "10683408", "10441302", "10399774", "10448199", "10341369", "10098219", "9799629", "9207127", "9177359", "9306288", "9097610", "7777601", "8038577", "7705324", "7705325", "7802414", "8037876", "8224040", "8518922", "8136068", "1400877", "1572948", "1611529", "2278660", "2317288", "3119649", "7190730", "1202204", "812160"], "inbound_citations": ["37207980", "36948776", "36075276", "36337024", "35661794", "35662578", "35633431", "35537569", "35343371", "35186450", "35021306", "34743290", "34686310", "33464922", "33561334", "33339431", "33324312", "33081371", "33041964", "33094209", "32844505", "32520353", "32497444", "32560743", "32222529", "32423709", "32777867", "32378366", "31901624", "31943448", "33008530", "33008525", "33008522", "31824320", "31296441", "31095735", "30930218", "31384712", "31190486", "30388596", "30347624", "30374289", "30209280", "30017800", "29438472", "29968077", "29522088", "29338083", "29500160", "28863017", "27357955", "28263765", "27235739", "28241356", "28241336", "28197837", "27816701"], "label": "0"}

The two treatment groups were comparable with regard to the demographic data and menopausal status. The primary efficacy criteria were the comparison between Menorest 50 and the reservoir transdermal patch in erythema and pruritus at application sites and the difference between the treatment groups in the mean number of hot flushes per day at week 12, adjusted for baseline. A statistically significant reduction in the mean number of hot flushes was observed in each group compared with baseline, with a decrease from 6.5 at baseline to 0.3 at 12 weeks and 6.4 to 0.4 in the Menorest 50 and reservoir transdermal patch groups respectively; there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups during the 12-week treatment. The severity score of menopausal symptoms was also dramatically improved in each of the two treatment groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean plasma estradiol concentrations and mean estradiol to estrone ratio (> 1.0) in both groups after 10 weeks of therapy. A similar number of adverse events was observed in both groups. Menorest 50 showed better local tolerability than the reservoir transdermal patch with a lower incidence of topical adverse events, erythema and pruritus. In summary, Menorest 50 was as effective as the reservoir transdermal patch in reducing the mean number of hot flushes, and improving the severity of other menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor, psychiatric and urogenital symptoms.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["31621155"], "label": "0"}

A total of 310 peri-/postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms were randomly allocated to oral sequential treatment with either the E2-DG combination (1.5 mg E2 for 24 days with 0.15 mg DG for the last 12 days followed by 1 placebo tablet for 4 days) or with the E2-NETA combination (Trisekvens, 2 mg E2 for 22 days with 1 mg NETA for the last 10 days followed by 1 mg E2 for 6 days). Treatments were administered double-blind for 12 cycles of 28 days. One hundred and four women, 48 in the E2-DG group and 56 in the E2-NETA group, discontinued the study due to bleeding irregularities and various adverse effects. Both treatments reduced menopausal symptoms and complaints effectively and almost equally. The alleviation of perspirations and the improvement of general fitness were more apparent (P = 0.009) during cycle 1 with the E2-NETA treatment but were greater (P < 0.02) during the last 9/10-12 cycles of E2-DG treatment compared to E2-NETA. Regular withdrawal bleeding appeared in 93% and 90% of the women during treatment with E2-DG and E2-NETA, respectively. Intermenstrual bleeding occurred in 8% of women receiving E2-DG and in 13% of women treated with E2-NETA. The corresponding figures for intermenstrual bleeding-spotting were 21% and 22%. Secretory endometrium was detected in 65% and 54% of the samples taken at the end of treatment with E2-DG and E2-NETA, respectively. No hyperplasia or atypia was found. No serious adverse events related to treatment occurred. Both regimens alleviated effectively menopausal complaints and did not induce hyperplasia of endometrium.

However, the occurrence of women with no bone response to HRT has not been widely examined. We identified the densitometric nonresponders to long-term HRT and investigated some characteristics and biochemical variables as possible predictors of densitometric nonresponse in postmenopausal women. The study population was a subsample of the Kuopio Osteoporosis Study (n = 14,220). A total of 464 early postmenopausal women were randomized into four treatment groups: (1) HRT (sequential combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg cyproterone acetate); (2) vitamin D3; (3) HRT + Vitamin D3 combined; and (4) placebo. In this study, the data from HRT and placebo groups were analyzed. Lumbar (L2-4) and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and after 5 years of treatment. A densitometric nonresponder was defined as a woman whose 5-year BMD change was similar to the mean BMD change (+95% CI) of the placebo group or worse. Altogether, 74 women in the HRT group and 104 women in the placebo group complied with the treatment. According to spinal BMD analysis, 11% of the women were classified as densitometric nonresponders; the corresponding proportion for femoral BMD analysis was 26%. Both smoking (p = 0.003) and low body weight (p = 0.028) were significant risk factors for densitometric nonresponse to HRT. After 6 months of treatment the densitometric nonresponders (hip) had a significantly higher mean serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level (p = 0.038) and lower increases in serum estradiol levels (p = 0.006) than the densitometric responders. The mean changes in serum FSH and alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly lower among the densitometric nonresponders (spine) than responders (p = 0.043 and 0.017, respectively). In conclusion, this prospective study shows that especially current smokers and women with low body weight are at increased risk of poor bone response to HRT. Repeated serum FSH, estradiol and alkaline phosphatase measurements during the first months of long-term HRT may be helpful in identifying the women with no bone response to HRT.", "outbound_citations": ["10022414", "9692075", "9353503", "9253321", "8363002", "1534476", "1558342", "2816518", "2883442", "3089821", "4047104"], "inbound_citations": ["37011667", "31620298", "28480658"], "label": "0"}

Sufficient calcium supplementation was given to bring all calcium intakes above 1000 mg/d in both groups; supplemental oral 25-hydroxyvitamin D was given to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of at least 75 nmol/L in both groups.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nBone mineral density of the spine, hip, total body, and forearm; serum total alkaline phosphatase and serum osteocalcin levels at 6-month intervals; and 24-hour urine creatinine and hydroxyproline excretion at baseline, 12 months, and 42 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring 3.5 years of observation, spinal bone mineral density increased by 3.5% (P < 0.001) in an intention-to-treat analysis and by 5.2% among patients with greater than 90% adherence to therapy. Significant increases were seen in total-body and forearm bone density (P < 0.01). Symptoms related to HRT (breast tenderness, spotting, pelvic discomfort, and mood changes) were mild and short-lived.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nContinuous low-dose HRT with conjugated equine estrogen and oral medroxyprogesterone combined with adequate calcium and vitamin D provides a bone-sparing effect that is similar or superior to that provided by other, higher-dose HRT regimens in elderly women. This combination is well tolerated by most patients.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34448749", "33802713", "28496491"], "label": "1"}

Estrogens or estrogen-progestins have been used to alleviate vasomotor symptoms. However, estrogen-androgen (E/A) therapy is also used for vasomotor symptom relief and has been shown to increase lean body mass while decreasing fat mass. The objective of this 16-wk, double-blind, randomized, parallel group clinical trial was to compare esterified estrogen plus methyltestosterone (1.25 mg estrogen + 2.5 mg methyltestosterone/d; E/A group) vs. esterified estrogen alone (1.25 mg/d; E group) on body composition. Forty postmenopausal women (mean age, 57 yr) participated. Compared with estrogen treatment alone, women in the E/A group increased their total lean body mass and reduced their percentage fat for all body parts (P < 0.05). After E/A treatment, there were statistically significant increases in lean body mass by 1.232 kg [0.181 +/- 0.004, 0.81 +/- 0.057, and 0.24 +/- 0.009 kg in the upper body (P = 0.021), trunk (P = 0.001), and lower body (P = 0.047), respectively].

In the E/A group, body fat was reduced by 0.90 kg (P = 0.18 for the trunk only), and percentage body fat declined by 7.4% (P < or = 0.05 for all body parts). Lower body strength increased by 23.1 kg (51 lb) in the E/A group vs. only 11 kg (24.25 lb) in the E group (P = 0.002 between groups). A statistically significant increase in weight (2.7 +/- 5.1 vs. 0.1 +/- 4.6 lb; P < 0.05) was observed in the E/A group compared with the E group. When subjects were given self-reporting questionnaires, more improvement was noted in sexual functioning and quality of life in the E/A group when compared with patients receiving E alone.

The frequency and severity of hot flushes were recorded daily. In study 2, performed in 845 women with intact uteri, transdermal E2/LNG (E2 0.045 mg/day with 0.015, 0.030, and 0.040 mg/day LNG) was compared with transdermal E2 0.045 mg/day monotherapy for thirteen 28-day treatment cycles. Women with endometrial tissue sufficient for evaluation underwent endometrial biopsy assessment at the end of cycle 13. Bleeding patterns were assessed throughout the study, and the Women's Health Questionnaire was used to assess well-being.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn study 1, transdermal E2/LNG (E2 0.045 mg/day with 0.030 and 0.040 mg/day LNG) significantly decreased the number and severity of hot flushes when compared with placebo. Symptom relief was seen as early as 2 weeks posttreatment. Similarly, in study 2, all three doses of transdermal E2/LNG and E2 controlled hot flushes with no differences between groups. In study 2, no women receiving transdermal E2/LNG developed endometrial hyperplasia compared with 19 (12.8%) who received transdermal E2 0.045 mg/day (p < 0.001 for each dose). Significant improvements from baseline in scores on the Women's Health Questionnaire for vasomotor symptoms, sleep problems, sexual function, cognitive difficulties, and total score were noted at all or most time points with both transdermal E2/LNG and E2. Application-site reactions, vaginal hemorrhage, and breast pain were the most common adverse events reported with transdermal E2/LNG. The proportion of women with amenorrhea increased over time in all treatment groups in study 2.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAll three doses of this once-a-week combined E2/LNG transdermal system rapidly and effectively control vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women while protecting against endometrial hyperplasia. Amelioration of vasomotor symptoms also is accompanied by improvements in aspects of subjective well-being. Once-a-week transdermal E2/LNG, therefore, offers an effective and convenient formulation, the dosing of which can be individualized according to the needs of each patient.", "outbound_citations": ["11137327", "10960628", "10756508", "10472853", "10389719", "9703530", "8892721", "8913986", "8707404", "8608096", "7573297", "7617369", "8178840", "8164926", "8097503", "1508062", "1550171", "2690638", "3739899", "6277698", "4351691"], "inbound_citations": ["33836486", "32893694", "32561330", "31621155", "30063464", "28667081"], "label": "1"}

Eighty healthy women, aged 50-57 years, at <5 years after the onset of menopause and with no previous use of HRT, were randomly assigned to one of four groups: HRT; exercise (Ex); HRT + Ex (ExHRT); and control (Co). HRT administration was conducted in a double-blind manner for 1 year using estradiol plus noretisterone acetate (Kliogest). The exercise groups participated in a 1 year progressive training program consisting of jumping and bounding activities. Subjects participated in two supervised sessions per week and were asked to perform a series of exercises at home 4 days/week. Bone measurements using a quantitative computed tomography scanner (Somatom DR, Siemens) were obtained from the proximal femur, midfemur, proximal tibia, and tibial shaft. Data were analyzed with a software program (BONALYSE 1.3) calculating density (g/cm(3)), cross-sectional area (CSA; mm(2)), and moments of inertia (I(max), I(min), I(polar)). In addition, the bone mass spectrum was determined as a function of the angular distribution around the bone mass center (polar distribution) and the distance from the bone mass center through the diaphyseal wall (radial distribution). After the 1 year period, there was an overall interaction of group x time in bone mineral density (BMD) at the proximal femur (p = 0.05) and tibial shaft (p = 0.035). Women in the ExHRT and HRT groups had increased proximal femur and tibial shaft BMD when compared with the change observed in the Co group (p = 0.024-0.011). The change was more pronounced in the cortical tibia, wherein the ExHRT group also differed from the Ex group (p = 0.038). No significant changes were found in bone CSA at any of the measured sites. The radial distribution indicated an increase of BMD in the endocortical part of the measured sites in the HRT and ExHRT groups and in the proximal tibia in the Ex group. The polar distribution showed that bone mass was redistributed in the anteroposterior direction. The changes in I(max), I(min), and I(polar) in the HRT and ExHRT groups differed from those in the Co group at the proximal femur, midfemur, and proximal tibia (p = 0.047-0.001). The Ex group also differed from the Co group in I(max) and I(polar) at the proximal tibia (p = 0.018 and 0.039, respectively). These results support the idea that HRT acts primarily at the bone-marrow interface. The exercise intervention chosen for this study contributed to the maintenance of bone mass. Our results suggest that both HRT and exercise have local effects on bone mass. The change in bone mass distribution induced by HRT and exercise may play an important role in the alteration of bone strength.", "outbound_citations": ["11473488", "10962351", "10893682", "10908406", "10663358", "10469274", "9090999", "10455519", "10368361", "10071917", "9951780", "10340635", "10367023", "9844097", "9718538", "9572792", "9611900", "9475883", "9405724", "10326058", "1614565", "9258753", "9197874", "8918277", "8869413", "8854239", "8830991", "8822346", "9035480", "7747621", "7990242", "8076582", "1729283", "1922205", "996549"], "inbound_citations": ["35690931", "34423690", "34444464", "34258508", "33357833", "32877972", "32017473", "30395051", "30503353", "29122708", "29098573", "28623425", "29910388"], "label": "1"}

Cognitive performance was tested at baseline and after 2 weeks of estradiol or placebo treatment using verbal, semantic, and spatial memory tests as well as a mental rotation task and the Stroop. Initial results showed no differences after treatment between placebo or estradiol treated subjects. However, within treatment group analysis revealed that estradiol treated subjects who reached higher estradiol levels (larger than 29 pg/ml) performed significantly better after treatment in the delayed recall of the paired associate test (verbal memory) than subjects who reached lower estradiol levels (P < 0.05). A nonsignificant trend was observed for the immediate recall condition (P < 0.10). These findings were strengthened by correlations between treatment-induced estradiol levels and changes in verbal memory performance. In addition, there was an association between estradiol levels and mood changes. However mood changes were not significantly associated with changes in verbal memory performance (P > 0.20). The present study supports the idea that estradiol replacement has specific effects on verbal memory in healthy postmenopausal women, with delayed recall being more affected. It suggests that these effects can occur relatively rapidly, and that there may be a dose response relationship of estradiol to memory enhancement. Furthermore, the fact that these results were obtained in women who had been menopausal for an average of 17 years before entering the study indicates that the brain maintains a sensitivity for estrogens even after years of low estradiol plasma concentrations.", "outbound_citations": ["10368772", "9754145", "9802129", "9491878", "9484355", "9393381", "9344404", "9344402", "9344405", "9215320", "9240390", "9153163", "9258889", "9030643", "9063585", "8675575", "8824322", "8831298", "7490007", "7720680", "8582205", "8064097", "7996203", "7802412", "8190445", "8487446", "1484915", "1613547", "1594723", "1567331", "1658700", "2329377", "3067252", "3161265", "1674854", "331844", "1065182", "1115999", "5096358", "13163372"], "inbound_citations": ["36834617", "36447434", "35674019", "34622524", "34508876", "32861751", "31948671", "31744009", "31279842", "29846283", "29044447", "27263667", "27815995"], "label": "0"}

Estrogen, in various formulations, is currently FDA-indicated for the prevention of osteoporosis. However, estrogen is not FDA-approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. Recent randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that estrogen significantly reduces fractures among osteoporotic postmenopausal women. Most postmenopausal women choose to use estrogen for relief of vasomotor symptoms and urogenital atrophy. HRT should be limited to osteoporosis prevention in women with significant ongoing vasomotor symptoms who are not at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

Progestins alone do not alleviate SAS in menopausal women. However, progestins may require concomitant estrogen administration and estrogen alone may stimulate breathing during sleep. To test these hypotheses, we studied the effects of estrogen alone and estrogen combined with progestin on SAS in menopausal women, using a prospective, cross-over, inception cohort study.\n\n\nDESIGN\nIn this pilot study, five women who developed SAS after menopause underwent 2 nights of polysomnography to obtain a baseline, then returned for polysomnography after 3-4 weeks of taking micronized 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and after 10-12 days of taking E2 combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (E2 + P). Sleep stages were scored according to Rechtshaffen and Kales, frequency and length of apneas were recorded for each subject each night, and the data were analyzed by Student's t test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nE2 and E2 + P both reduced the Respiratory Distress Index. E2 also raised the lowest oxygen desaturation associated with apneic episodes. Total minutes of rapid eye movement sleep increased, and the number of waking episodes decreased when the women were taking E2 and E2 + P, as previously reported.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWithin 1 month after initiating E2 or E2 + P, SAS was reduced in all patients. The Respiratory Distress Index decreased by 25%, and the addition of progestin brought the SAS reduction to 50% in this pilot study. A randomized study in a large group of patients is justified by the findings of this study. Because SAS increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and fatal accidents, the amelioration of SAS by sex steroid hormones could have significant implications for the health of menopausal women.", "outbound_citations": ["3335138", "6472126", "6451714", "1003373"], "inbound_citations": ["35731786", "33470769", "33796148", "34025318", "32735650", "31837319", "31739179", "29365014", "29759271", "28832429", "27836648"], "label": "0"}

Methods to preserve bone density in these women need to be explored. This multicenter, international, randomized, blinded, 12-month study was conducted to assess the effect of alendronate sodium on bone density in women who had recently discontinued HRT.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe 144 postmenopausal women included in the study were diagnosed as having low bone mineral density (BMD) and had recently discontinued HRT. They were randomized to receive either a daily dose of 10 mg of alendronate sodium or matching placebo. The main outcome measures were spine, hip, and total body BMD; biochemical markers of bone turnover; and tolerability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlendronate treatment was associated with a 2.3% mean increase (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7%-3.0%) in spine BMD compared with a mean loss of 3.2% (95% CI, - 4.6% to - 1.7%) in patients receiving placebo, for a difference of 5.5% (95% CI, 4.2%-6.8%) between alendronate and placebo. Greater hip and total body BMD preservation was also observed with alendronate use. Bone turnover decreased significantly with alendronate (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels decreased by 20% and urinary N-telopeptide/creatinine ratio by 47%), but increased in the placebo group (by 18% and 36%, respectively). Alendronate was well tolerated, with no increase in adverse events compared with placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA high rate of bone loss was observed in the first 12 to 15 months after discontinuation of HRT in postmenopausal women with low BMD. Treatment with alendronate increased or maintained both spine and hip BMD and prevented the increase in bone resorption seen with withdrawal of HRT in this population.", "outbound_citations": ["12117397", "11497535", "11468217", "11445025", "11308252", "11444087", "11127765", "11095442", "10999794", "10954759", "10913923", "10782361", "10690882", "10914621", "10477542", "10487668", "10550467", "10614677", "10614674", "9718051", "9382121", "9200008", "9040575", "8950879", "8854239", "7985914", "1534476", "3109607", "6110089", "78095", "57448"], "inbound_citations": ["37130601", "36945065", "35934822", "34448749", "34310233", "33240217", "33195764", "32623487", "30963388", "29946734", "29229501", "28650869", "28667435", "28492856", "28448754", "30775498", "28144701"], "label": "0"}

The trial was conducted at a single academic US medical center from January 1996 to May 2001.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomly assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial design to receive hormone replacement (conjugated equine estrogen, 0.625 mg/d, with or without medroxyprogesterone, 2.5 mg/d) and alendronate, 10 mg daily, both agents, or neither.

Mean (SD) increases in bone mass at the hip in women treated with alendronate alone were significantly greater than in those treated with hormone replacement therapy alone (4.2% [3.8] vs 3.0% [4.9]; P<.05, respectively), and alendronate resulted in more responders to therapy. All therapies were well tolerated and participant retention was 90% at 3 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCombination therapy with hormone replacement and alendronate was efficacious and well tolerated in this cohort.

Postmenopausal women were treated for 9 weeks with either a combination of 1.25 mg esterified estrogen and 2.5 mg methyltestosterone (E+A) or 1.25 mg conjugated equine estrogen (CEE). Both groups showed a similar decrease in urinary excretion of the bone resorption markers, deoxypyridinoline, pyridinoline, and hydroxyproline. Patients treated with CEE showed decreases in the serum markers of bone formation, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and C-terminal procollagen peptide. In contrast, subjects treated with E+A showed increases in these markers of bone formation. CEE increased, and E+A decreased serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin as well as triglycerides and high density lipoprotein levels. Only CEE significantly reduced low density lipoproteins. Both regimens were effective in reducing postmenopausal somatic symptoms, but only E+A had a significant effect on psychological symptoms. We conclude that short term administration of androgen with estrogen may reverse the inhibitory effects of estrogen on bone formation. Long term studies are needed to determine the relative benefits and risks of the combination of estrogen and androgen and whether this results in greater increases in bone mass and strength.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36877247", "35568447", "32637065", "31731497", "29683499", "28710257"], "label": "0"}

Sexual function was assessed with a questionnaire used in the Yale midlife survey, and plasma levels of estradiol, estrone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and beta-endorphin were measured at two- to four-week intervals.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEstrogen-androgen therapy significantly improved sexual sensation and desire after four and eight weeks of double-blind treatment in comparison to previous estrogen therapy and postplacebo baseline assessments. Plasma levels of estradiol and estrone increased significantly in all patients as compared to the postplacebo baseline and decreased in comparison to circulating estrogen concentrations on previous therapy. Relative proportions of free and bound steroid hormone exhibited contrasting shifts during estrogen and estrogen-androgen therapy. SHBG increased in the estrogen group and decreased in the estrogen-androgen group, leading to lower amounts of free androgens during estrogen therapy and increased free androgen levels during estrogen-androgen therapy. Since proportions of free (bioavailable) ovarian steroids would correlate inversely with plasma protein binding capacity, the beneficial effects of oral estrogen-androgen therapy on sexual sensation and desire may be due either to the administered androgen or to the increased availability of endogenous and exogenous androgens, particularly in the central nervous system.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSexual desire, satisfaction and frequency in postmenopausal women taking hormonal therapy were improved significantly by combined estrogen-androgen therapy but not by estrogen or estrogen-progestin therapy. Sexual function improved with estrogen-androgen therapy even though circulating estrogen levels were lower than those measured during previous estrogen therapy.

The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included objective response (OR) rate, duration of response (DOR), and tolerability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients (n = 400) were followed for a median period of 16.8 months. Fulvestrant was as effective as anastrozole in terms of TTP (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95.14% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.14; P =.43); median TTP was 5.4 months with fulvestrant and 3.4 months with anastrozole. OR rates were 17.5% with both treatments. Clinical benefit rates (complete response + partial response + stable disease > or = 24 weeks) were 42.2% for fulvestrant and 36.1% for anastrozole (95% CI, -4.00% to 16.41%; P =.26). In responding patients, median DOR (from randomization to progression) was 19.0 months for fulvestrant and 10.8 months for anastrozole. Using all patients, DOR was significantly greater for fulvestrant compared with anastrozole; the ratio of average response durations was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10 to 1.67; P < 0.01). Both treatments were well tolerated.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFulvestrant was at least as effective as anastrozole, with efficacy end points slightly favoring fulvestrant. Fulvestrant represents an additional treatment option for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer whose disease progresses on tamoxifen therapy.", "outbound_citations": ["8049456", "12177099", "10951345", "10813716", "10376613", "9747868", "9060536", "8688341", "7563152", "7844613", "7772169", "8445433", "8426212", "1855205", "3412740"], "inbound_citations": ["37301716", "36993590", "36980649", "36848014", "36602669", "36551586", "36198984", "36081610", "35735430", "35923930", "36081610", "34903444", "34694932", "34644735", "34555836", "34866317", "34398352", "34304064", "34236340", "35201439", "33869913", "33810205", "33579962", "33418233", "33398005", "34659898", "33983590", "33170262", "32669317", "32265426", "32259783", "32234755", "31927211", "31671026", "31538681", "31599350", "31486688", "31471390", "31336602", "31292328", "31004402", "30911948", "30587451", "30608416", "31215379", "30510455", "30235292", "30190545", "30191850", "29739819", "30214302", "29974356", "30057418", "29975948", "29934412", "29931061", "29910644", "29783894", "29749272", "30489256", "29674510", "29664714", "29660596", "29522716", "29601247", "29450827", "29289555", "29162647", "28666813", "29910644", "29349762", "29178019", "29171761", "29143738", "29344106", "28719836", "28344099", "28717399", "28614816", "29441507", "28680952", "28314835", "28454587", "28477031", "28454109", "28232241", "28043088", "28054957", "27729460"], "label": "0"}

Jia-Wey Shiau-Yau San (JWSYS), one of the traditional Chinese herbal prescriptions, is a famous herbal remedy used for the management of various menopausal-related symptoms. A randomized, controlled pilot study was performed to evaluate the clinical effects of JWSYS compared with those of a continuous combined hormone replacement therapy, Premelle, on quality of life in non-hysterectomized postmenopausal women. The present trial compared the effect of a l6-week treatment with JWSYS or HRT (Premelle) in postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms. The Greene Climacteric Scale was used to assess the clinical effects at baseline and after 16 weeks' treatment with either JWSYS or Premelle. The physiological parameters, such as follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels, were also recorded at the same time points. The results showed that JWSYS had a relatively lower discontinuation rate due to adverse effects, in particular the bleeding and breast tenderness. Both JWSYS and Premelle effectively alleviated most of the menopausal symptoms with no significant differences between treatment groups, whereas the beneficial effects of JWSYS were not mediated by hormone replacement-like effects. Moreover, JWSYS showed a good compliance and safety without estrogenic effects and metabolic alterations. It was suggested that JWSYS was a safe and efficacious therapy and might be an alternative choice for relief of climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women. However, the exact efficacy and clinical roles of JWSYS have not been convincingly demonstrated in this study because of the blinding approach and some statistical concerns, and only the possibility of its efficacy has been raised. Therefore, a blinding trial with more patient numbers to evaluate the efficacy of JWSYS deserves further study.", "outbound_citations": ["10694998", "9820257", "9643514", "9260354", "8688771", "8596318", "8746874", "8038643", "8127335", "7999460", "8288016", "8418405"], "inbound_citations": ["32337064", "30868921", "29899696", "28733527", "27965049", "28911662"], "label": "0"}

Subjects (n=70) were randomized into two groups with one group to receive 17beta-estradiol and other group tibolon. All subjects were evaluated at baseline and after 3-months of HRT with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).\n\n\nRESULTS\nForty six of 70 patients completed the study. The 17beta-estradiol (n=23) and the tibolone (n=23) groups were similar with respect to age, education and occupational status. The time from onset of menopause was longer in the tibolon group. HARS and HDRS scores were significantly decreased after 3 months of HRT in both the 17beta-estradiol and the tibolone groups. The two drug regimens were not significantly different in this respect.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHRT with 17beta-estradiol and tibolone improves symptoms of anxiety and depression in menopausal women.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36970277", "28278011"], "label": "0"}

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) results in only modest increases in bone mineral density (BMD). However, for women with low bone mass, the ideal therapy should not only inhibit bone resorption but simultaneously stimulate bone formation to increase bone mass above the fracture threshold. We thus performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study to prospectively investigate the effect of a low dose of fluoride, in combination with HRT, on BMD and biochemical markers of bone turnover. One hundred healthy postmenopausal women (60-70 yr old) were thus randomly assigned to: 1) HRT [transdermal 17beta-estradiol, releasing 50 microg/day; plus oral norethisterone acetate (NETA), 1 mg/day]; or 2) oral monofluorophosphate (MFP; equivalent to fluoride, 20 mg/day); or 3) HRT+MFP; or 4) placebo, for 96 weeks. All participants received a calcium supplement of 1000 mg/day. Sixty-eight women completed the study. We found a pronounced, linear increase in spinal BMD during treatment with HRT+MFP [11.8% (1.7% SEM)], which was significantly greater than the increase in the HRT group [4.0% (0.5% per yr); P < 0.05]. MFP produced a smaller increase [2.4% (0.6% per yr)], whereas there was no change in the placebo group [0.0% (0.5% SEM)]. Similar changes were found at the other skeletal sites (distal forearm, hip, and total body). Markers of bone formation showed a fall in the HRT group, which was significantly more pronounced than in the combined HRT+MFP group. A nonsignificant increase was found in the MFP group, whereas the placebo group showed a decrease caused by calcium treatment. The marker of bone resorption decreased significantly more in the HRT and the HRT+MFP groups than in the placebo group but tended to increase in the MFP group. In conclusion, this study shows, by use of biochemical markers of bone turnover, that bone resorption and formation may be dissociated, as a result of actions of two compounds with diverging effects on bone turnover. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of relatively low doses of the compounds suggested statistically and clinically significant increases in trabecular and probably also cortical bone.

Twelve women participated in a five-session, within-subjects, double-blind study, in which they received placebo, transdermal estradiol (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg), or D-amphetamine (15 mg, oral) in a randomized order. Amphetamine was included as a positive control. Dependent measures included self-report measures of mood, physiological measures, and plasma hormone levels. Despite dose-dependent increases in plasma estradiol levels, and despite the fact that D-amphetamine produced its prototypic stimulant-like effects in these postmenopausal women, estradiol did not produce effects on mood. The finding that acute administration of exogenous estradiol did not alter mood suggests that more chronic exposure to estradiol is needed to produce mood-enhancing effects.", "outbound_citations": ["6193003", "3931144", "10899363", "10644899", "10445374", "9840563", "9473622", "9396940", "9330235", "9105666", "9203229", "7561861", "7632610", "7700570", "7925760", "8300981", "1786488", "1846872", "2125712", "2168762", "2375582", "2966832", "3615546", "2880114", "3954864", "3903822", "4076343", "6241202", "7201404", "7296174", "6783392", "7219671", "6447529", "7189902", "162497", "874483", "5565851", "5554941"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which we treated boys with constitutional delay of puberty with testosterone plus placebo or testosterone plus a potent fourth-generation aromatase inhibitor, letrozole. Findings: Letrozole effectively inhibited oestrogen synthesis. The 17\u03b2-oestradiol concentrations increased in the untreated group and in the testosterone/placebo-treated group, but in the testosterone/letrozole-treated group no such increase was observed until letrozole treatment was discontinued. Testosterone concentrations were threefold higher in the testosterone/letrozole-treated group than in the other groups. Within 18 months, bone age had advanced by 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 years in the untreated group and by 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 years in the testosterone/placebo-treated group, but only by 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 years in the testosterone/letrozole-treated group (p = 0.02 between treatment groups). Predicted adult height did not change significantly in the untreated group and in the testosterone/placebo-treated group, whereas in the testosterone/letrozole-treated group the increase was 5.1 \u00b1 1.2 cm (p = 0.004).

However, compliance with HRT was reported to be low despite the benefits of HRT. In addition, results of several recent large-scale randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that protection from cardiovascular disease is not an indication for treatment with estrogen and progestin in postmenopausal women. Recent studies have demonstrated that low-dose HRT is safe and effective for prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. Low-dose HRT has also been shown to be effective for reducing the number and severity of hot flashes, improving vaginal atrophy, and inducing favorable changes in lipids, lipoproteins and hemostatic factors. Moreover, low-dose regimens of CEE (conjugated equine estrogen) and MPA (medroxyprogesterone acetate) result in higher rates of amenorrhea and endometrial protection compared with the conventional dose of HRT. Low-dose HRT may improve the compliance rate and may be more effective than conventional-dose HRT for reducing the risk of breast cancer. On the other hand, it has been shown that transdermal estrogen treatment reduces the incidence and severity of hot flashes and that long-term treatment with transdermally administered estrogen is effective for protection against osteoporosis. Transdermal administration of estrogen is recommended in postmenopausal women with hypertriglycemia because this treatment has little effect on lipid metabolism. The serum estradiol level was reported to be closely related to estrogenic effects on various tissues. An HRT regimen should be based on the needs of each patient. Serum estradiol levels in women should be maintained at appropriate levels for benefits and not be excessively high in order to prevent side effects. Selection of the most appropriate regimen of HRT (dose, route of administration and schedule) for the needs of the individual are important factors to increase the rate of continuation with HRT.", "outbound_citations": ["12629123", "12590012", "12356628", "12270582", "12230415", "12020302", "11907298", "11836045", "11779264", "12626208", "11518885", "11815726", "11438314", "11384630", "11428175", "10068384", "10633293", "10614674", "9840563", "9718051", "9661589", "11907925", "9316518", "9186438", "9158080", "9217668", "8672166", "8865147", "7573298", "7807658", "7935028", "1420088", "1470047", "1536260", "1922206", "3578453", "3789576", "3012339", "6374537", "7083191", "7078891", "629289", "4457403"], "inbound_citations": ["29036760"], "label": "0"}

Sixty healthy women who had been postmenopausal for 1 to 5 years were recruited and divided into following 4 groups: group 1, percutaneous gel 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) 1.5 mg/d plus micronized progesterone (MP) 100 mg/d; group 2, percutaneous gel 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) 1.5 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2 mg/d; group 3, percutaneous gel 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) 0.75 mg/d plus micronized progesterone (MP) 100 mg/d; and group 4, percutaneous gel 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) 0.75 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2 mg/d. Estrogen and progestin were given continuously for 25 days per month. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using quantitative computed tomography (QCT) for trabecular bone of L2-5 and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for L2-4 and hip 5 times during the trial at baseline and at the 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 36-month visits.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-nine patients (98.3%, 59/60) stayed in the study for 1 year, 56 patients (93.3%, 56/60) for 2 years, and 51 (85%, 51/50) for 3 years. On average, menopausal symptoms were relieved by 80% after 6 months of treatment. By the 24th month, the mean increase in BMD ranged from 4.3% to 7.5% in trabecular bone; and by the 36th month, it ranged from 4.2% to 6.2% in L2-4 and 1.61% to 3.77% in the neck. There were significant difference after treatment (P < 0.05). Among the four groups, no significant difference (P > 0.05) was found in improvement of symptoms, levels of bone markers or BMD.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA daily dose of estradiol gel, either 0.75 mg or 1.5 mg, is effective in preventing early postmenopausal bone loss and relieving menopausal symptoms.

Vasomotor and behavioral effects were evaluated by using the Kupperman score, while changes in plasma endorphin (beta-END) levels were used as marker of neuroendocrine effects.

Irregular vaginal bleeding can occur at the beginning of treatment, but it has been observed that after a few months patients are in amenorrhea. Fifty postmenopausal women were studied in order to evaluate the clinical outcome. Half of them were treated with a product containing 2 mg estradiol valerate and 2.5 mg medroxiprogesterone acetate, while the other half received a placebo. Menopause symptomatology was recorded as described by Blatt-Kupperman, depression was evaluated with the use of Hamilton's test, lipid profile by enzymatic methods and endometrial thickness by transvaginal ultrasonography. Patients were evaluated at the beginning, third and sixth month of the study, following a double blind methodology. Symptomatology diminished both in patients under CCT and using placebo, although improvement was significantly greater in patient under CCT. Thus in the hormone treated group the Blatt-Kupperman score fell from 12.1 to 6.4 and 3.2 in the third and sixth month respectively, while in the group receiving placebo the score fell from 11.5 to 6.3 in the third month and raised to 7.4 in the sixth month. Hamilton's test showed a significant improvement of depression only in patients under hormone therapy. Nineteen out of twenty five women using CCT had vaginal bleeding, showing no changes in the endometrial thickness during the study.

Breast cancer risk was analyzed by the following baseline characteristics indicative of estrogen exposure: previous hormone replacement therapy, prevalent vertebral fractures, family history of breast cancer, estradiol level, bone mineral density (BMD), body mass index, and age at menopause. Therapy-by-subgroup interactions were assessed using a logistic regression model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, women with the highest one-third estradiol levels (> or = 12 pmol/L) had a 2.07-fold increased invasive breast cancer risk compared with women with lower levels. Raloxifene significantly reduced breast cancer risk in both the low- and high-estrogen subgroups for all risk factors examined (P <.05 for each comparison). The women with the highest BMD and those with a family history of breast cancer experienced a significantly greater therapy benefit with raloxifene, compared with the two thirds of patients with lower BMD or those without a family history, respectively; the subgroup-by-therapy interactions were significant (P =.005 and P =.015, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe MORE trial confirms that increased lifetime estrogen exposure increases breast cancer risk. Raloxifene therapy reduces breast cancer risk in postmenopausal osteoporotic women regardless of lifetime estrogen exposure, but the reduction is greater in those with higher lifetime exposure to estrogen.", "outbound_citations": ["11136842", "10880557", "10659874", "10636510", "10636511", "10511593", "10360815", "10376571", "10214833", "10068384", "9731736", "9785310", "9625169", "9600478", "9385122", "9020494", "7481246", "7752271", "7707406", "2232041", "2307535", "2729251"], "inbound_citations": ["35954371", "34448090", "34385978", "32692262", "31357528", "30940549", "30634494", "29987611", "29945225", "28927816", "28768504", "27885264"], "label": "0"}

Recent studies demonstrated that oral ET causes a sustained increase in CRP, implicating a proinflammatory effect. Because CRP is synthesized in the liver, we hypothesized that estrogen-induced CRP elevation is related to first-pass hepatic metabolism. In 21 postmenopausal women, we conducted a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study to compare the effects of transdermal versus oral ET on CRP and inflammatory cytokines. We measured CRP, interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha before and after eight weeks of transdermal estradiol (E(2)) (100 microg/day), oral conjugated estrogen (CEE) (0.625 mg/day), or placebo. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hepatic-derived anabolic peptide, was also measured. Transdermal E(2) had no effect on CRP or IGF-1 levels. In contrast, eight weeks of oral conjugated estrogens caused a more than twofold increase in CRP and a significant reduction in IGF-1 (p < 0.01) in the same women. The magnitude of increase in CRP was inversely correlated to the decrease in IGF-1 (r = -0.49, p = 0.008). Neither transdermal E(2) nor oral CEE had any effects on the plasma concentrations of cytokines that promote CRP synthesis. In postmenopausal women, oral but not transdermal ET increased CRP by a first-pass hepatic effect. An increase in CRP levels is accompanied by a reduction in IGF-1, an anti-inflammatory growth factor. Because CRP is a powerful predictor of an adverse prognosis in otherwise healthy postmenopausal women, the route of administration may be an important consideration in minimizing the adverse effects of ET on cardiovascular outcomes.", "outbound_citations": ["12234944", "12208797", "12190368", "12186793", "12117397", "12015523", "11932303", "11914251", "11739438", "11056086", "10978254", "10954759", "10959719", "10733371", "10674617", "10896637", "10449693", "10449692", "10465182", "9090999", "10404769", "9718051", "8989151", "7918685", "1991807"], "inbound_citations": ["36574008", "35192961", "33819637", "32450447", "31973967", "31372078", "31080789", "29706967", "29527831", "28763395", "27516000"], "label": "0"}

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a 1-yr course of oral DHEA treatment vs. conventional hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) in young women with AN. Sixty-one young women were randomly assigned to receive oral DHEA (50 mg/d) or HRT (20 micro g ethinyl estradiol/0.1 mg levonorgestrel). Anthropometric, nutrition, and exercise data were acquired every 3 months, and bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) every 6 months over 1 yr. Serum samples were obtained for measurements of hormones, proresorptive cytokines, and bone formation markers, and urine was collected for determinations of bone resorption markers at each visit. In initial analyses, total hip BMD increased significantly and similarly (+1.7%) in both groups. Hip BMD increases were positively correlated with increases in IGF-I (r = 0.44; P = 0.030) and the bone formation marker, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase increased significantly only in the DHEA treatment group (P = 0.003). However, both groups gained significant amounts of weight over the year of therapy, and after controlling for weight gain, no treatment effect was detectable. There was no significant change in lumbar BMD in either group. Both bone formation markers, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, increased transiently at 6-9 months in those subjects receiving DHEA compared with the estrogen-treated group (P < 0.05). Both DHEA and HRT significantly reduced levels of the bone resorption markers, urinary N-telopeptides (P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between changes in IGF-I and changes in weight, body fat determined by DXA, and estradiol for both groups. In addition, patients receiving DHEA exhibited improvement on three validated psychological instruments (Eating Attitudes Test, Anorexia Nervosa Subtest, and Spielberger Anxiety Inventory). Both DHEA and HRT had similar effects on hip and spinal BMD. Over the year of treatment, maintenance of both hip and spinal BMD was seen, but there was no significant increase after accounting for weight gain. Compared with HRT, DHEA appeared to have anabolic effects, evidenced by the positive correlation between increases in hip DXA measurements and IGF-I and significant increases in bone formation markers.

A total of 241 community-dwelling women reporting vasomotor symptoms at baseline were randomized into one of three groups. In all groups, participants consumed a daily supplement containing 25 g of soy protein and were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) isoflavone extracted soy protein (control), (b) soy protein with a medium dose of isoflavones (42 mg/day), or (c) soy protein with a higher dose of isoflavones (58 mg/day). The primary outcome measure in this trial was change in reported vasomotor symptoms. Results A reduction in the number and severity of vasomotor symptoms was observed in all three treatment groups. No significant differences in the number and severity of vasomotor symptoms were observed among the high isoflavone, middle isoflavone, or control groups. The lack of a between-treatment group effect was observed even after stratified by number of baseline symptoms and use of traditional hormone replacement therapy.

Whether other antiresorptive therapies can prevent osteoporosis in these women is also not clear.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied the effect of 2.5 mg or 5 mg of alendronate per day or placebo on bone mineral density in 1174 postmenopausal women under 60 years of age. An additional 435 women who were prepared to receive a combination of estrogen and progestin were randomly assigned to one of the above treatments or open-label estrogen-progestin. The main outcome measure was the change in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, hip, distal forearm, and total body measured annually for two years by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe women who received placebo lost bone mineral density at all measured sites, whereas the women treated with 5 mg of alendronate daily had a mean (+/-SE) increase in bone mineral density of 3.5+/-0.2 percent at the lumbar spine, 1.9+/-0.1 percent at the hip, and 0.7+/-0.1 percent for the total body (all P<0.001). Women treated with 2.5 mg of alendronate daily had smaller increases in bone mineral density. Alendronate did not increase bone mineral density of the forearm, but it slowed the loss. The responses to estrogen-progestin were 1 to 2 percentage points greater than those to the 5-mg dose of alendronate. Alendronate was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo or estrogen-progestin.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlendronate prevents bone loss in postmenopausal women under 60 years of age to nearly the same extent as estrogen-progestin.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36945065", "36596944", "34448749", "34397808", "30964193", "31653155", "29440373", "28492856", "28448754", "28326300", "27789666"], "label": "1"}

Specifically, in the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS), a primary prevention trial,1 treatment with lovastatin among an apparently healthy group of individuals without traditional coronary risk factors resulted in significant reductions in future cardiovascular events. Application of the results of that trial and of the West of Scotland primary prevention trial of pravastatin2 suggests that tens of millions of Americans without manifest atherosclerosis could benefit from lipid-lowering therapy.\n\nSuch a blanket approach, however, may be unwise from medical as well as economic perspectives. Unnecessary exposure to pharmacological agents, even those as safe as the statins, will ultimately subject some asymptomatic and low-risk individuals to unwanted side effects. Furthermore, economic constraints dictate that primary prevention strategies with even modest cost must be limited to those individuals who are likely to gain the greatest benefit. Even when an inexpensive preventive therapy such as low-dose aspirin is proven effective,3 behavioral barriers on the parts of both physicians and patients must be overcome if long-term compliance is to be achieved. All of these considerations highlight the need for better methods to stratify risk of atherosclerotic events in apparently healthy populations.\n\nClinical strategies designed to improve risk prediction have taken several forms. Imaging techniques including carotid ultrasound, MRI, and electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) all hold promise for identifying \u201cvulnerable plaques\u201d and detecting silent atheroma. However, prospective studies demonstrating the clinical utility of these approaches are limited. For example, a recent study4 of coronary calcification detected by EBCT has shown that this method does not accurately predict future coronary events, even in high-risk patients. The cost of these noninvasive imaging modalities may also prohibit their application for widespread screening application.\n\nProvocative testing of endothelium-dependent \u2026", "outbound_citations": ["10484536", "10375342", "10338455", "10021466", "9892589", "9727541", "9711934", "9686751", "9613910", "9610529", "9603539", "9439492", "9416885", "9403635", "9250400", "9077376", "8093914", "2664509"], "inbound_citations": ["35711345", "34390063", "34138771", "34019755", "33839698", "35373026", "33094648", "32229693", "31547601", "32598808", "31179489", "31282281", "31388406", "30816799", "30830550", "30816799", "31073376", "29022500", "30527148", "30237802", "30023927", "29579604", "29372034", "29430085", "28479197", "28038796", "28159429", "27453537"], "label": "0"}

The cause of DMPA-associated bone loss is not known, but the relative estrogen deficiency induced by DMPA use could be responsible. We have undertaken a randomized, double-blind controlled trial of oral estrogen replacement therapy in 38 premenopausal women (mean age 37) with a minimum 2 yr DMPA use who had a below average baseline lumbar spine BMD (T score < or = 0). Nineteen women were allocated to receive conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg/d orally) and 19 to receive a matching placebo. All continued with regular DMPA injections throughout the study. Areal bone density was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total body sites every 6 months for 2 yr; the main outcome measure being the change in areal BMD at the lumbar spine. At baseline, the two groups were well matched for demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical variables, and for BMD. Twenty-seven subjects completed at least 18 months in the study, and 26 the full 2 yr, with similar numbers dropping out from each group (mainly for personal reasons). In the estrogen-treated group, mean lumbar spine BMD increased 1%, whereas in the placebo group it fell 2.6%, over 2 yr. The between group differences were 2.0% at 12 months (P = 0.058), 3.2% at 18 months (P < 0.01), and 3.5% at 24 months (P < 0.002).

Subjects were evaluated at baseline, at weeks 3, 5, and 8 during treatment, and again 8 weeks after treatment termination. During each visit, cognition was assessed with a battery of neuropsychological tests, and blood samples were collected to measure plasma estradiol as well as several other neuroendocrine markers of interest. Results: Significant effects of estrogen treatment were observed on attention (Stroop Color Word Interference Test), verbal memory (Buschke Selective Reminding Test), and visual memory (Figure Copy/Memory). In addition, women treated with estrogen demonstrated improved performance on a test of semantic memory (Boston Naming Test) compared with subjects who received a placebo. Estrogen appeared to have a suppressive effect on the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system such that plasma concentration of IGF binding protein-3 was significantly reduced and plasma levels of estradiol and IGF-I were negatively correlated during estrogen treatment. Conclusions: Administration of a higher dose of estrogen may enhance attention and memory for postmenopausal women with AD.

We examined the effects of gonadal steroids on lymphocytic PBR density in nine women with prospectively confirmed PMS and nine controls. PBR densities were measured during three pharmacologically controlled conditions: gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (Lupron)-induced hypogonadism, Lupron plus estradiol, and Lupron plus progesterone replacement. Blood samples were obtained after six weeks of Lupron alone and after 3-4 weeks of estradiol and progesterone replacement. No significant hormone state-related changes in PBR density were observed (ANOVA-R: phase-F(2,32)=1.5, P=0.2). Despite mood symptom development in the subjects with PMS, PBR density did not differ in women with PMS compared to controls across hormonal states (ANOVA-R: F(1,16)=0.6, P=0.4). PBR densities are not altered in women with PMS and are not changed significantly by selective gonadal steroid administration.

Patients and methods: In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study, early postmenopausal women with at least seven moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per day were randomized to receive intranasal estradiol, 150 or 300 \u03bcg/day, or placebo, for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the mean daily number of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, as recorded in patient diaries. Results: A total of 165 patients were randomized. The mean daily number of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms decreased significantly more (p < 0.001) in the 150-\u03bcg/day (\u20137.86) and 300-\u03bcg/day (\u20139.39) groups than in the placebo group (\u20135.22).

The rate of emergent adverse events with both doses was similar to that with placebo. Conclusions: Pulsed estrogen therapy, achieved by intranasal estradiol 150 \u03bcg/day and 300 \u03bcg/day, significantly reduced the incidence of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, compared with placebo. The 300-\u03bcg/day dose demonstrated a greater and more rapid therapeutic effect, with no clinically significant difference in tolerability, compared with the 150-\u03bcg/day dose, and therefore offers the best efficacy/safety ratio when initiating treatment with intranasal estradiol.", "outbound_citations": ["12083627", "11390122", "11173180", "11084176", "11063903", "10775738", "10739506", "10687882", "9872489", "9389776", "9141548", "8841224", "8530713", "7715479", "7877518", "8456888", "8447683", "3144919", "3578450", "3080464", "13061588"], "inbound_citations": ["31621155"], "label": "0"}

DesignTwenty-three nondepressed, early postmenopausal women (average age, 52.5 years) completed a 91-day, single-blind pilot study with the following sequence of treatments: 1 week of no substance; 2 weeks of placebo; 2 weeks of progestogen only; 1 week of placebo; and 2 months of \u201cstandard hormone replacement therapy cycles,\u201d which consisted of (in order) 2 weeks of 0.625 mg CEE, 2 weeks of CEE plus progestogen, 2 weeks of CEE, and 2 weeks of CEE plus progestogen. Ten women who completed the study received MPA (5 mg/day) as their progestogen, and 13 who completed the study received micronized, oil-suspended progesterone (200 mg/day) as their progestogen. All participants made daily assessments of mood using the Profile of Mood States and daily recordings of somatic symptoms. All subjects had plasma follicle-stimulating hormone of greater than 35 IU/L and had not had spontaneous vaginal bleeding for more than 1 year. ResultsNone of the hormone treatments had a detectable effect on mood. MPA users reported more vaginal bleeding and breast tenderness than progesterone users. ConclusionsIn contrast with the widely held belief among psychiatrists that progesterone depresses mood, neither of the progestogens we used in normal, nondepressed and nonanxious women showed this effect. Absence of an effect on mood was also found when the results of the two progestogens were combined. The lesser side effects of the micronized progesterone-containing regimen suggest that some women may prefer it to an MPA-containing regimen.", "outbound_citations": ["11799954", "11528357", "11439947", "11386980", "10746889", "10914621", "10519605", "10839650", "10614674", "9840563", "9435325", "9391989", "9203229", "9286739", "9432094", "8732468", "8666121", "8931904", "7925760", "7936542", "1846872", "2946605", "4061059", "7211966"], "inbound_citations": ["36447434", "36075250", "34570303", "32842052", "31409166", "29630427", "28802473", "28501236"], "label": "0"}

This single-centre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group trial was conducted to determine the direct effects of fulvestrant on the female endometrium when given alone and in combination with the oestrogen, ethinyloestradiol. Following a 14-day, pretrial screening period, 30 eligible postmenopausal volunteers were randomised to receive fulvestrant 250 mg, fulvestrant 125 mg or matched placebo administered as a single intramuscular injection. Two weeks postinjection, volunteers received 2-weeks concurrent exposure to ethinyloestradiol 20 microg day(-1). Endometrial thickness was measured before and after the 14-day screening period with further measurements predose (to confirm a return to baseline) and on days 14, 28 and 42 post-treatment with fulvestrant. Pharmacokinetic and safety assessments were performed throughout the trial. Fulvestrant at a dose of 250 mg significantly (P=0.0001) inhibited the oestrogen-stimulated thickening of the endometrium compared with placebo.

The symptoms are characteristic of a heat\u2010dissipation response and consist of sweating on the face, neck, and chest, as well as peripheral vasodilation. Although hot flashes clearly accompany the estrogen withdrawal at menopause, estrogen alone is not responsible since levels do not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Until recently it was thought that hot flashes were triggered by a sudden, downward resetting of the hypothalamic setpoint, since there was no evidence of increased core body temperature. Evidence obtained using a rapidly responding ingested telemetry pill indicates that the thermoneutral zone, within which sweating, peripheral vasodilation, and shivering do not occur, is virtually nonexistent in symptomatic women but normal (about 0.4\u00b0C) in asymptomatic women. The results suggest that small temperature elevations preceding hot flashes acting within a reduced thermoneutral zone constitute the triggering mechanism. Central sympathetic activation is also elevated in symptomatic women which, in animal studies, reduces the thermoneutral zone. Clonidine reduces central sympathetic activation, widens the thermoneutral zone, and ameliorates hot flashes. Estrogen virtually eliminates hot flashes but its mechanism of action is not known. Am.

Cognitive function was not measured at baseline. The mean age of participants at the time of cognitive function testing was 71 +/- 6 years. There were no differences in age-adjusted cognitive function test scores between the two treatment groups, except that women assigned to hormones scored worse on the Verbal Fluency test than women assigned to placebo (15.9 +/- 4.8 vs. 16.6 +/- 4.8, P = 0.02). Adjustment for other potential confounders and restriction of the analyses to women who had been adherent to study medication did not change the results.

On July 8, 2002, the study drugs, estrogen plus progestin, in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial were discontinued because of certain increased health risks in women receiving combined hormone therapy. To evaluate the effect of estrogen plus progestin on the incidence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment compared with placebo. The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, began enrolling participants from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin trial in May 1996. Of the 4894 eligible participants of the WHI study, 4532 (92.6%) postmenopausal women free of probable dementia, aged 65 years or older, and recruited from 39 of 40 WHI clinical centers were enrolled in the WHIMS. Participants received either 1 daily tablet of 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 2229), or a matching placebo (n = 2303). Incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) and mild cognitive impairment (secondary outcome) were identified through a structured clinical assessment. The mean (SD) time between the date of randomization into WHI and the last Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) for all WHIMS participants was 4.05 (1.19) years. Overall, 61 women were diagnosed with probable dementia, 40 (66%) in the estrogen plus progestin group compared with 21 (34%) in the placebo group. The hazard ratio (HR) for probable dementia was 2.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-3.48; 45 vs 22 per 10 000 person-years; P =.01). This increased risk would result in an additional 23 cases of dementia per 10 000 women per year. Alzheimer disease was the most common classification of dementia in both study groups. Treatment effects on mild cognitive impairment did not differ between groups (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.74-1.55; 63 vs 59 cases per 10 000 person-years; P =.72). Estrogen plus progestin therapy increased the risk for probable dementia in postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older. In addition, estrogen plus progestin therapy did not prevent mild cognitive impairment in these women. These findings, coupled with previously reported WHI data, support the conclusion that the risks of estrogen plus progestin outweigh the benefits.", "outbound_citations": ["12771113", "12682311", "12660385", "12584376", "12573734", "12566949", "11749982", "12413378", "12410906", "12369809", "12186605", "12117397", "12084801", "11997695", "11956955", "11884656", "12137718", "11735772", "11255447", "11104641", "11424956", "11113342", "11113299", "11089820", "10851363", "10847257", "10858597", "10668686", "10867223", "10603286", "10522948", "10323642", "10190820", "10102413", "9875839", "9799621", "9799627", "9566385", "9496988", "9484355", "9546791", "9492970", "9344400", "9054233", "9214519", "9269213", "9191758", "9106666", "9106616", "8933010", "8892341", "8709781", "8780008", "7731492", "7966923", "8080389", "8059882", "8030628", "8190445", "8487446", "1484915", "1517447", "1953971", "2240084", "2233632", "2771064", "3067252", "3611032", "6496779", "4430702", "4748864", "5089457"], "inbound_citations": ["37255734", "37217080", "37010830", "37187679", "37061205", "36938738", "36749328", "36737481", "36804773", "36834617", "36624497", "36671411", "36512265", "36552610", "36456994", "36447434", "36551821", "36336171", "36318128", "36318127", "36316487", "36420620", "36205005", "36442814", "36294482", "36178170", "36198316", "36240091", "36240090", "36029852", "35908135", "35928995", "35912083", "35807939", "35797481", "35760047", "36337024", "35694859", "35624141", "35616610", "36184115", "35526556", "35453610", "35381014", "35356299", "35395561", "35568447", "35710453", "35102101", "35021306", "35112096", "34560131", "36281666", "34100436", "33896621", "36160335", "36396272", "34849527", "34779290", "34803659", "34732544", "34698102", "34623401", "34622524", "34588168", "34508876", "34448749", "34432008", "34513605", "34538724", "34342862", "34323137", "34337790", "34252006", "34227023", "34225325", "34103606", "34002428", "34027024", "33977823", "33844047", "33894641", "33757928", "33815241", "33688775", "33615942", "33586564", "33561436", "34934803", "33208540", "32781107", "34535618", "33706960", "33350669", "33400738", "33385889", "33135943", "32949557", "32955459", "32910516", "32910343", "32804095", "32767022", "32743748", "32893509", "32735650", "32677442", "32653624", "33384533", "32611495", "32573980", "35871709", "32542593", "32512250", "32576368", "32297302", "32317959", "32210745", "32207833", "32112728", "32060544", "32057896", "31995690", "31976839", "31938786", "31921942", "31862208", "33008530", "32406030", "31496308", "31921740", "31663985", "31503029", "31418472", "31803046", "31744009", "31685499", "31394491", "31720367", "31680862", "31613825", "31279842", "31513776", "31551757", "31129153", "35116885", "30928686", "31326978", "31379556", "32396982", "31364065", "30471324", "31072403", "30853470", "31021713", "31009947", "31080785", "29574082", "30814325", "30822161", "29649433", "30846424", "30842086", "30909491", "30570355", "30332613", "30408169", "30288749", "31311712", "30775973", "30530972", "30604380", "30412484", "30401555", "30355506", "30216118", "30627643", "30358733", "30320589", "30356809", "30344476", "30713672", "30322209", "29754747", "30319538", "30218184", "29762147", "30132047", "30021919", "29970000", "29907423", "29876339", "28977360", "29643079", "30271832", "29190460", "29555333", "29683360", "29671495", "29316527", "28416813", "29237239", "29952604", "29375366", "29255847", "28326612", "29234780", "29274405", "28847295", "28587815", "19112812", "30298180", "28843780", "29319603", "29121799", "29234813", "29234814", "28980489", "31898881", "26891883", "28983317", "28898378", "28945939", "28703016", "28650869", "28664754", "28575011", "28578785", "28577965", "28476121", "27263667", "28319236", "27039345", "28757769", "28274328", "27716751", "27368418", "28322310", "28539995", "28202700", "28509627", "27436369", "27991654", "28275722", "28093732", "28074678", "28074409", "28067513", "27870425", "27767986", "27906568", "27697063", "27178194", "28103749", "27575548", "28854503"], "label": "0"}

During the first six months after delivery the prevalence of major depression is estimated at 12-13%.w1 The precise time frame for defining postnatal depression has varied across studies, typically from one month to one year after childbirth. In an effort to standardise the terminology, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fourth edition, restricted the specifier of postpartum onset to depressive episodes occurring within four weeks of delivery. However, most studies of postnatal depression have continued to use wider time frames, in part because epidemiological studies show that women's heightened vulnerability to depression continues for at least the first six months after childbirth. Postnatal depression must be distinguished from postnatal blues (\u201cbaby blues\u201d), a common experience following childbirth, in which new mothers experience lability of mood and tearfulness. This mild and self limiting condition typically disappears two weeks after delivery.\n\nUnfortunately postnatal depression is often overlooked in primary care clinics.

Sixteen nonsmoking, eumenorrheic women (age 23.2 +/- 1.4 years, 68.7 +/- 1.0 kg) were studied at sea level and during 12 days of high-altitude exposure (4,300 m). Subjects received either alpha-blockade (prazosin 3 mg/d) or a placebo in a double-blinded, randomized fashion. Resting plasma and 24-hour urine samples were collected periodically throughout the duration of the study. Further, subjects participated in submaximal exercise tests (50 minutes at 50% sea level maximum oxygen consumption [Vo2max]) at Sea level and on days 1 and 12 at altitude. Urinary norepinephrine (NE) excretion rates increased significantly over time at altitude, with blocked subjects having greater values compared to controls. Plasma NE levels increased significantly with chronic altitude exposure compared to sea level and acute hypoxia both at rest and during exercise. NE levels at rest were greater for blocked compared to control subjects during all conditions. Urinary and plasma epinephrine (EPI) levels increased dramatically, with acute altitude exposure returning to sea level values by day 12 of altitude exposure. EPI levels were greater for blocked compared to placebo both at rest and during exercise for all conditions studied. Changes in alpha-adrenergic activity over time at altitude were associated with select metabolic and physiologic adjustments. The presence of alpha-blockade significantly affected these responses during chronic altitude exposure. It was concluded that: (1) alpha-adrenergic blockade elicited a potentiated sympathoadrenal response to the stress of both exercise as well as high-altitude exposure, and (2) the sympathetics, via alpha-adrenergic stimulation, contribute to a number of key adaptations associated with acclimatization to high altitude.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29210916"], "label": "0"}

In turn, chronically elevated glucocorticoids increase circulating leptin. HPA axis hyperactivity occurs in 30-50% of patients with major depression, but the few prior reports of leptin measurements in this illness have shown inconsistent results. We, therefore, measured plasma leptin in 12 female and 8 male unipolar major depressives and 12 female and 8 male individually matched normal controls administered low-dose physostigmine (PHYSO) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) to stimulate the HPA axis. The subjects underwent four test sessions 5-7 days apart: PHYSO (8 microg/kg IV); AVP (0-08 U/kg IM); PHYSO+AVP; and saline control. Serial blood samples were taken before and after pharmacologic challenge and analyzed for leptin, ACTH(1-39), cortisol and AVP. Estradiol and testosterone also were measured at each test session. PHYSO and AVP produced no side effects in approximately half the subjects and predominantly mild side effects in the other half, with no significant patient-control differences. Correlations between side effects (absent or present) after PHYSO or AVP and the corresponding leptin responses were non-significant in all groups. Baseline plasma leptin concentrations (mean+/-S.D.) were significantly higher in the female patients compared to the female controls (22.5+/-13.9 ng/ml vs. 12.3+/-9.7 ng/ml), whereas they were similar in the male patients and the male controls (3.9+/-1.4 ng/ml vs. 3.6+/-2.0 ng/ml). Leptin concentrations following PHYSO remained unchanged from baseline, indicating that the short-lived ACTH and cortisol increases produced by PHYSO did not affect leptin secretion. In contrast, AVP administration, while also increasing ACTH and cortisol, significantly suppressed leptin, more so in the women than in the men. Baseline leptin and the leptin decrease after AVP were moderately positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Scale 'somatization' factor in the female patients (r=0.50) and more strongly correlated with the 'mood-depression' factor in the male patients (r=0.81).

Therefore, several new therapies are currently under development to optimize the risk/benefit ratio of osteoporosis treatment. Strontium ranelate is composed of an organic moiety (ranelic acid) and of two atoms of stable nonradioactive strontium. In vitro, strontium ranelate increases collagen and noncollagenic proteins synthesis by mature osteoblast enriched cells. The effects of strontium ranelate on bone formation were confirmed as strontium ranelate enhanced pre-osteoblastic cell replication. The stimulation by strontium ranelate of the replication of osteoprogenitor cell and collagen, as well as noncollagenic protein synthesis in osteoblasts, provides substantial evidence to categorize strontium ranelate as a bone-forming agent. In the isolated rat osteoclast assay, a pre-incubation of bone slices with strontium ranelate induced a dose- dependent inhibition of the bone resorbing activity of treated rat osteoclast. Strontium ranelate also dose-dependently inhibited, in a chicken bone marrow culture, the expression of both carbonic anhydrase II and the alpha-subunit of the vitronectin receptor. These effects showing that strontium ranelate significantly affects bone resorption due to a direct and/or matrix-mediated inhibition of osteoclast activity and also inhibits osteoclasts differentiation, are compatible with the profile of an anti-resorptive drug. In normal rats, administration of strontium ranelate induces an improvement in the mechanical properties of the humerus and/or the lumbar vertebra associated with a commensurate increase in bone dimension, shaft and volume. Strontium ranelate was administered in 160 early postmenopausal women, in a 24-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective randomized study. Daily oral dose of 125 mg, 500 mg and 1 g of strontium ranelate were compared with a placebo. At the conclusion of the study, the percent variation of lumbar-adjusted bone mineral density from baseline was significantly different in the group receiving 1 g/day of strontium ranelate compared with placebo (+1.41% vs. -0.98%, respectively). Increase in total hip and neck bone mineral density averages, respectively, 3.2% and 2.5%. Strontium ranelate does not induce any significant adverse reaction compared with those observed in women receiving a placebo for the same duration. In a phase II study, the effect of strontium ranelate in postmenopausal women with vertebral osteoporotic fractures was assessed during a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Doses of 500 mg, 1 g and 2 g daily of strontium ranelate or placebo were given to 353 Caucasian women with prevalent osteoporosis. At the conclusion of this 2-year study, the annual increase in lumbar-adjusted bone mineral density of the group receiving 2 g of strontium ranelate was + 2.97%. This result was significantly different compared with placebo. A significant increase in bone alkaline phosphatase and, over a 6-month period, a significant decrease in urinary-pyridium crosslinks (NTX) were evidenced. During the second year of treatment, the dose of 2 g was associated with a 44% reduction in the number of patients experiencing a new vertebral deformity. Bone histomorphometry showed no mineralization defects. The same percentage of withdrawals following an adverse effect was observed for patients receiving placebo and for those receiving 2 g of strontium ranelate. The compound was further investigated in a large phase III program that included two extensive trials for the treatment of severe osteoporosis, one assessing the effects of strontium ranelate on the risk of vertebral fractures (SOTI) and one evaluating its effects on peripheral (nonspinal) fractures (TROPOS). The primary analysis of the SOTI study, evaluating the effect of 2 g of strontium ranelate on vertebral fracture rates, revealed a 41% reduction in the relative risk of expein the relative risk of experiencing a first new vertebral fracture with strontium ranelate, throughout the 3-year study, compared with placebo. The TROPOS study, showed a significant (p = 0.05) reduction in the relative risk of experiencing a first non-vertebral fracture in the group treated with strontium ranelate throughout the 3-year study compared with placebo in the intention-to-treat population. A 41% reduction in the relative risk of experiencing a hip fracture was demonstrated in the per protocol population. All these results imply that strontium ranelate is a new, effective and safe treatment for vertebral and nonvertebral osteoporosis, with a unique mode of action.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34710839", "28595782", "28159606", "27615270", "27838465"], "label": "0"}

Results: Cholecystectomy was reported by 1750 women during 8 years of follow-up.

Although the risk for past hormone users decreased substantially in women who had discontinued use 1-2.9 years ago (RR 1.6,95% CI 1.2-2.0), a small risk persisted for women who had stopped taking hormones 5 or more years previously (RR 1.3,95% CI 1.1-1.6).

There is strong evidence from basic sciences and epidemiological studies that both estrogens and androgens play a protective role in neurodegeneration.

The abbreviation HRT (traditionally standing for \"hormone replacement therapy\") is used herein because of its wide recognition in the field. However, the pharmacological doses of estrogens and progestins used are not truly \"replacement\" in nature.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine whether women lose bone mineral density (BMD) after stopping HRT; to assess whether their rate of loss is significantly greater than that of women not undergoing HRT; and to determine whether long-term HRT is associated with continued gains in BMD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 495 women who were adherent to assigned treatment in the 3-year Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions randomized controlled trial (PEPI-RCT) and who had an additional BMD measurement during the PEPI Safety Follow-up Study were observed for an average of 3 years during and 4 years after the PEPI-RCT.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWomen who stopped HRT after 1 year during the PEPI-RCT had annual rates of BMD change of -0.54% (hip) and -0.81% (spine) during the following 2 years. Those who underwent HRT for 3 years during the PEPI-RCT and then discontinued it had annual changes of -1.01% (hip) and -1.04% (spine). Rates of BMD loss among women who stopped HRT during or after the PEPI-RCT did not differ significantly from those of women who did not undergo HRT, who lost bone at a rate of approximately 1% yearly during the first year of the PEPI-RCT and about half that rate afterward. Women who continued HRT after the PEPI-RCT did not show additional BMD gains.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results do not support the hypothesis that bone is lost at an unusually fast rate after discontinuation of HRT, nor do they suggest that longer-term HRT leads to additional BMD gain beyond that evident after 3 years.", "outbound_citations": ["10957752", "10659874", "10100182", "9193889", "9197874", "9193885", "9032160", "8607727", "8892713", "7587218", "7817796", "7817832", "8199078", "2126198", "2197950", "2726631", "3657888", "3740045", "7168798", "6110089", "78095", "57448", "5828725"], "inbound_citations": ["36749328", "35717745", "34402365", "33706956", "33364931", "32519298", "31741221", "29738419", "29462096"], "label": "1"}

The present study investigates whether transdermal ERT can eliminate the adverse effects of oral ERT on the size and oxidative susceptibility of LDL in postmenopausal women. Methods and Results\u2014Postmenopausal women received no treatment (n=12) or were treated with either 0.625 mg oral conjugated equine estrogen daily (n=16) or with transdermal estradiol (50 &mgr;g/d, n=16) for 3 months. Plasma lipids and the diameter of LDL particles were determined. Susceptibility of LDL to oxidation was analyzed by incubation with CuSO4 and subsequent measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) concentrations. Oral ERT significantly increased plasma triglyceride and decreased LDL diameter but did not affect LDL-derived TBARS concentrations. In contrast, transdermal ERT significantly decreased the concentrations of plasma triglyceride and LDL-derived TBARS and significantly increased LDL diameter. Estrogen-induced changes in LDL diameter correlated negatively with changes in plasma triglyceride (r =\u22120.51, P <0.001) and LDL-derived TBARS (r =\u22120.50, P <0.001).

A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the effect of 1 and 2 mg oestradiol on menopausal symptoms, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and QOL in 152 postmenopausal women over a 12 month study period. Menopausal symptoms were measured using a modified Kupperman's scale.

Baseline scoring of vasomotor symptoms in our population was low whilst QOL scoring was relatively high. Over 12 months, after adjustment for differences in baseline scoring, there was a significant reduction in menopausal symptom scores in the 2 mg oestradiol group compared with placebo but not in the 1 mg group. There were no statistically significant changes in levels of anxiety and depression or QOL in either the 1 or the 2 mg group compared with placebo. These results suggest that relatively few Chinese women will be expected to benefit from hormone replacement in terms of either QOL or mood.

Despite this, research showing the benefits of androgen replacement has been limited to the postmenopausal years. In view of the known premenopausal physiological decline in testosterone, we have evaluated the efficacy of transdermal testosterone therapy on mood, well-being, and sexual function in eugonadal, premenopausal women presenting with low libido. DesignPremenopausal women with low libido participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, efficacy study of testosterone cream (10 mg/day) with two double-blind, 12-week, treatment periods separated by a single-blind, 4-week, washout period. ResultsThirty-four women completed the study per protocol, with 31 women (mean age 39.7 \u00b1 4.2 years; serum testosterone 1.07 + 0.50 nmol/L) providing complete data. Testosterone therapy resulted in statistically significant improvements in the composite scores of the Psychological General Well-Being Index [+12.9 (95% CI, +4.6 to +21.2), P = 0.003] and the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self-Rating Scale [+15.7 (95% CI, +6.5 to +25.0), P = 0.001] compared with placebo. A mean decrease in the Beck Depression Inventory score approached significance [\u22122.8 (95% CI, \u22125.7 to +0.1), P = 0.06]. Mean total testosterone levels during treatment were at the high end of the normal range, and estradiol was unchanged. No adverse effects were reported. ConclusionsTestosterone therapy improves well-being, mood, and sexual function in premenopausal women with low libido and low testosterone. As a substantial number of women experience diminished sexual interest and well-being during their late reproductive years, further research is warranted to evaluate the benefits and safety of longer-term intervention.", "outbound_citations": ["11782044", "11231994", "11114169", "10974131", "10946891", "10665617", "10993027", "10372681", "10323370", "9543161", "9253307", "9251835", "9219109", "8654628", "7616872", "7612515", "7714119", "8499341", "1735475", "1861642", "2966832", "3615768", "2880114", "3097458", "3710274", "3955323", "4079820", "6442755", "6333175", "6140343", "331844", "13892577"], "inbound_citations": ["37246051", "36841309", "36368624", "36189794", "35430926", "35757050", "33792440", "33814355", "33518182", "33384313", "33131104", "32979503", "32893509", "32707117", "32657193", "32541291", "32191598", "32063470", "31963733", "31462149", "31580837", "31353194", "31374371", "31078200", "31632719", "30918494", "30635029", "31241598", "30239842", "30168087", "29752749", "29541946", "27393080", "28609390", "28291031", "28343552", "28117267", "27916205", "28477652"], "label": "0"}

Agents that significantly reduced nonvertebral fracture risk also appear to produce larger mean increases in bone mineral density (BMD) and reductions in biochemical markers (BCM) of bone turnover, compared with other agents. To examine the extent to which increases in BMD and reductions in BCM during antiresorptive therapy are associated with reductions in risk of nonvertebral fractures, we performed a meta-analysis of all randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antiresorptive agents conducted in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (i.e. prior vertebral fracture or low BMD) with available relevant data. A total of 18 such trials with usable data were identified, including a total of 2,415 women with incident nonvertebral fractures over 69,369 women-years of follow-up. Poisson regression was used to estimate the association between changes in BMD or BCM during the first year and overall reductions in risk of nonvertebral fractures (vs. the placebo group) across all trials. Larger increases in BMD and larger reductions in BCM were significantly associated with greater reductions in nonvertebral fracture risk. For example, each 1% increase in spine BMD at 1 yr was associated with an 8% reduction in nonvertebral fracture risk (P = 0.02). Mean BMD changes at the hip were smaller than at the spine, but the predicted net effect on fracture risk was the same; an agent that increases spine BMD by 6% at 1 yr reduces nonvertebral fracture risk by about 39%, and an agent that increases hip BMD by 3% at 1 yr reduces nonvertebral fracture risk by about 46%. The results also predict that a 70% reduction in resorption BCM would reduce risk by 40%, and a 50% reduction in formation BCM would reduce risk by 44%. It appears that either BMD or BCM changes are able to explain the effect of treatment, because a separate variable for treatment was not independently significant in any models. These data demonstrate that larger increases in BMD at both the spine and hip and larger reductions in both formation and resorption BCM are associated with greater reductions in the risk of nonvertebral fractures.

Fifty-six healthy volunteer women with intact uterus, between six months and three years after a natural menopause, were recruited and randomised into two groups to have blood and urine laboratory test for assessment of bone resorption marker of deoxypyridinoline, bone formation marker of bone specific alkaline phosphatase, lipid profile including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride, and menopausal symptoms. Information was taken at initial visit and 1, 2 and final follow-up after taking medication.\n\n\nRESULTS\nContinuous Kliogest treatment resulted in significant reduction in menopausal symptoms, as scored by Integrated Greene Climacteric Scale and in the psychological, somatic and vasomotor subscales scores (p = 0.009). Kliogest reversed the negative trends in lipoprotein profiles by lowering total cholesterol (p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001), and triglyceride (p = 0.004), but decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.002). A significant reduction in bone resorption marker, deoxypyridinoline, was also observed in the Kliogest group (p < 0.001). There was no report of serious adverse events, endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in the Kliogest treated patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFour-month treatment with Kliogest resulted in an improvement in menopausal symptoms and lipid profiles as well as reduction in bone loss.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35496275"], "label": "1"}

Participants kept a daily bleeding calendar documenting bleeding events (none, spotting or required sanitary protection) and side effects (headache, nausea, breast tenderness, depression, premenstrual syndrome and bloating). Primary outcome was number of bleeding days. Secondary outcomes included bleeding days requiring sanitary protection, amenorrhea, patient acceptability of bleeding patterns, method satisfaction and affective side effects. There were no differences in the baseline characteristics of the two groups. Although total bleeding days were fewer in the continuous group (mean = 25.9 vs. 34.9 days), this result did not reach statistical significance. However, women in the continuous group reported significantly fewer bleeding days that required protection (18.4 vs. 33.8 days, p < 0.01), and were more likely to have amenorrhea. Although both groups reported a high level of satisfaction with bleeding patterns and side effect profiles, women in the continuous group reported significantly fewer days of bloating (0.7 vs. 11.1 days, p = 0.04), and menstrual pain (1.9 vs. 13.3 days, p < 0.01). Continuous use of 20 microg ethinyl estradiol/100 microg levonorgestrel is associated with less bleeding requiring protection, and more amenorrhea than standard administration. Taken with or without a hormone-free interval, this oral contraceptive formulation is highly acceptable with regard to bleeding patterns and side effect profile.

Between July 24, 2000, and October 31, 2000, 56 women aged 55 to 74 years were randomized; 2 in the placebo group and 1 in the active treatment group did not complete the 6-month evaluation, and none withdrew because of adverse effects. Women randomized to active treatment (n = 27) took two pills per day, each containing 55 mg of soy-extracted isoflavones (110 mg total isoflavones per day; Healthy Woman: Soy Menopause Supplement, Personal Products Company, McNeil-PPC Inc., Skillman, NJ, USA). Women assigned to placebo (n = 26) took two identical-appearing pills per day containing inert ingredients. Cognitive function tests administered at baseline and follow-up included the following: Trails A and B, category fluency, and logical memory and recall (a paragraph recall test assessing immediate and delayed verbal memory). ResultsAt baseline, all women were cognitively intact; there were no significant differences by treatment assignment in age, education, depressed mood, or cognitive function (all P values > 0.10). Compliance was 98% and 97%, respectively, in the placebo and treatment groups; all women took at least 85% of their pills. The women in the treatment group did consistently better, both as compared with their own baseline scores and as compared with the placebo group responses at 6 months. Comparisons of percentage change in cognitive function between baseline and follow-up showed greater improvement in category fluency for women on active treatment as compared with the case of those on placebo (P = 0.02) and showed (nonsignificantly) greater improvement on the two other tests of verbal memory and Trails B.

Design Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment trial of raloxifene and placebo with open-label 17&bgr;-estradiol ring. At 10 sites in the United States, 91 postmenopausal women with at least two signs of vaginal atrophy were treated with a 17&bgr;-estradiol ring and randomized to receive concomitant raloxifene 60 mg/day or placebo for 6 months. Efficacy of treatments was evaluated by comparing investigator assessments of genitourinary atrophic signs, vaginal maturation value, and participant assessments of vaginal symptoms at 6 months. Other measures included rate and severity of hot flashes and assessment of sexual function. Uterine safety was assessed by endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound. Results In women treated with a 17&bgr;-estradiol ring, both the raloxifene and placebo treatment groups showed improvements in signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy at 6 months, with no significant differences in degree of improvement between groups. There were no signs of endometrial proliferation in either group.

Forty healthy postmenopausal women without vasomotor symptoms were randomized to transdermal 17beta-estradiol (E2) 50 microg/day for 14 weeks or identical transdermal placebo patches. Postural balance was measured with dynamic posturography before and after 4, 12, and 14 weeks of therapy. In this test, the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems were provoked with increasing difficulty and body sway was measured with a dual forceplate. A low score showed large sway and a score of 100 showed no sway at all. Thirty-eight women completed the study. Both groups had normal balance for their ages and near maximum scores in the three easier balance tests at baseline. In the most difficult test, both groups improved their postural balance significantly (from 13 to 32 and from 22 to 39, respectively) after 4 weeks. Thereafter, no change was seen. One problem was low statistical power, but the relative change in balance did not differ between groups. The comparison did not show even a minute advantage of E2 over placebo, so a study with higher power would probably not have shown a more pronounced effect of estrogen than placebo. The change over time did not differ between groups, which indicates a significant learning effect. In women without vasomotor symptoms, estrogen therapy did not seem to increase postural balance significantly more than placebo.

Among the treatments currently popular are extracts of wild yam (Dioscorea villosa), which are applied topically in the form of a cream. These preparations are known to contain steroidal saponins, including diosgenin, which has been claimed to influence endogenous steroidogenesis. However, there have been no studies of the safety or efficacy of these preparations in the management of menopausal symptoms. Methods: We therefore conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of the effects of a wild yam cream in 23 healthy women suffering from troublesome symptoms of the menopause. After a 4-week baseline period, each woman was given active cream and matching placebo for 3 months in random order. Diaries were completed over the baseline period and for 1 week each month thereafter, and blood and saliva samples were collected at baseline and at 3 and 6 months, for measurement of lipids and hormones. Results: The average age of the subjects was 53.3 \u00b1 1.1 (SEM) years and average time since last period 4.3 \u00b1 0.9 years. At baseline, the average body mass index was 27.3 \u00b1 0.8, cholesterol level 5.7 \u00b1 0.2 mmol/l and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 74.2 \u00b1 5.1 IU/l; estradiol levels were undetectable in the majority of cases. After 3 months of treatment, no significant side-effects were reported with either active treatment or placebo, and there were no changes in weight, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or levels of total serum cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, FSH, glucose, estradiol, or serum or salivary progesterone. Symptom scores showed a minor effect of both placebo and active treatment on diurnal flushing number and severity and total non-flushing symptom scores, and on nocturnal sweating after placebo, but no statistical difference between placebo and active creams. Conclusions: This study suggests that short-term treatment with topical wild yam extract in women suffering from menopausal symptoms is free of side-effects, but appears to have little effect on menopausal symptoms. It emphasizes the importance of careful study of treatments for menopausal symptoms if women are to be adequately informed about the choices available to them.", "outbound_citations": ["10841878", "11910672", "11910671", "9738088", "9738094", "9640524", "9738092", "9366888", "8794812", "8596318", "7893741", "7857294", "7912373", "8418405", "1459613", "1992191", "393299", "322905", "6035341", "5959892"], "inbound_citations": ["37252752", "36217795", "35875677", "35677108", "34288904", "34356661", "33858012", "32947880", "32781063", "32984100", "31989693", "31972180", "30868921", "32802090", "30083104", "30104552", "28540223"], "label": "0"}

This study explored the effect of menstrual cycle phase on the mood-altering and performance effects of a single oral dose of the benzodiazepine triazolam. Twenty women received triazolam (0.25 mg orally) or placebo at the follicular, periovulatory, and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles in a within-subject design. Dependent measures included self-reported mood states, psychomotor performance, and plasma levels of triazolam, estradiol, progesterone, and allopregnanolone. After administration of triazolam, most subjects reported the expected increases in fatigue and decreases in arousal and psychomotor performance. Neither plasma levels nor mood and performance effects of triazolam differed across the three phases. This study illustrates a useful methodology for assessing responses to psychoactive drugs in normally cycling women and shows that the effects of this drug were highly stable across the cycle.", "outbound_citations": ["9089849", "9000458", "8532187", "7616904", "7714225", "7989476", "7944869", "8120150", "7904330", "8305004", "1575248", "1740491", "1914376", "1679388", "1702937", "1854375", "2334030", "2825703", "2422758", "2865026", "2861282", "6149030", "6140318", "7062953", "7059433", "6121870", "6123298", "6117563", "7002180", "445949", "4762224"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

DHEA possibly prevents immunosenescence, and as a neuroactive steroid it may influence processes of cognition and memory. Epidemiological studies revealed an inverse correlation between DHEAS levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in men, but not in women. To define a suitable dose for DHEA substitution in elderly men we studied pharmacokinetics and biotransformation of orally administered DHEA in 14 healthy male volunteers (mean age, 58.8 +/- 5.1 yr; mean body mass index, 25.5 +/- 1.5 kg/m2) with serum DHEAS concentrations below 4.1 micromol/L (1500 ng/mL). Diurnal blood sampling was performed on 3 occasions in a single dose, randomized, cross-over design (oral administration of placebo, 50 mg DHEA, or 100 mg DHEA). The intake of 50 mg DHEA led to an increase in serum DHEAS to mean levels of young adult men, whereas 100 mg DHEA induced supraphysiological concentrations [placebo vs. 50 mg DHEA vs. 100 mg DHEA; area under the curve (AUC) 0-12 h (mean +/- SD) for DHEA, 108 +/- 22 vs. 252 +/- 45 vs. 349 +/- 72 nmol/L x h; AUC 0-12 h for DHEAS, 33 +/- 9 vs. 114 +/- 19 vs. 164 +/- 36 micromol/L x h]. Serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone remained unchanged after DHEA administration. In contrast, 17beta-estradiol and estrone significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner to concentrations still within the upper normal range for men [placebo vs. 50 mg DHEA vs. 100 mg DHEA; AUC 0-12 h for 17beta-estradiol, 510 +/- 198 vs. 635 +/- 156 vs. 700 +/- 209 pmol/L x h (P < 0.0001); AUC 0-12 h for estrone, 1443 +/- 269 vs. 2537 +/- 434 vs. 3254 +/- 671 pmol/L x h (P < 0.0001)]. In conclusion, 50 mg DHEA seems to be a suitable substitution dose in elderly men, as it leads to serum DHEAS concentrations usually measured in young healthy adults. The DHEA-induced increase in circulating estrogens may contribute to beneficial effects of DHEA in men.", "outbound_citations": ["9626121", "9253337", "9253308", "9449250", "9070216", "8917605", "8899734", "8943804", "8772596", "8623801", "8597453", "7840167", "7977274", "7911183", "7515387", "8299591", "8010623", "8267058", "8217878", "1400863", "1533090", "1719016", "2144295", "2141887", "2140789", "3409497", "2957589", "2946952", "6235241", "7195404", "6449285", "4229259"], "inbound_citations": ["36450312", "34312190", "31237150", "31182991", "29874650", "29571766", "28865807", "27814977", "28711911", "27519632"], "label": "0"}

Secondary aims were to establish the relationship between menopausal age and the occurrence of irregular bleeding for both therapies and to assess the efficacy of both therapies in alleviating menopausal symptoms. This was a stratified and randomised, open label study conducted with late peri and postmenopausal women at 35 sites in Austria and Germany. A total of 446 women were randomly allocated into two cohorts based on time since last bleeding and then stratified to either a low dose continuous combined therapy consisting of 1 mg E(2) and 0.5 mg NETA for 28 days or a sequential therapy consisting of 0.625 mg CEE for 28 days and 5 mg MG for the final 14 days. Bleeding and menopausal complaints were continuously assessed. Treatments were administered for 9 lunar months. The incidence rate of women presenting irregular bleeding episodes including spotting during cycle 9 was 12.2% with 1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA and 25.8% with 0.625mgCEE/5mgMG (P = 0.0014). In the group of postmenopausal women (time since last bleeding > or = 12 months) the incidence of irregular bleeding during cycle 9 was 11.0% for 1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA and 25.0% for 0.625mgCEE/5mgMG). In the group of late perimenopausal women (time since last bleeding 6-11 months) the incidence of irregular bleeding was similar for both treatments at cycle 3, but markedly less in patients with 1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA at cycle 6 and 9, being significantly different compared to patients with 0.625mgCEE/5mgMG at cycle 6 (P < 0.05). The cumulative rate of amenorrhea (no bleeding or spotting) achieved with 1mgE(2)/0.5mgNETA was 89% for the postmenopausal women and 83.7% for the late perimenopausal women. Both treatments relieved menopausal complaints equally effective. Regarding the occurrence of irregular bleeding, the low dose continuous combined therapy was superior to the sequential therapy (0.625mgCEE/5mgMG). The low dose continuous combined E(2)/NETA regimen is also suitable for late perimenopausal women since more than 80% of the women had no bleeding or spotting after 9 months of treatment.", "outbound_citations": ["11836043", "11791082", "10675831", "10694323", "10759060", "10472853", "10614676", "10614674", "8861087", "7958011", "7715479", "8164926", "8147175", "8259753", "3048871", "3784918", "7026979"], "inbound_citations": ["32893694"], "label": "0"}

Ospemifene (FC-1271a) is a novel SERM compound, which has been shown in animal models to have estrogen-like effects on bone and the cardiovascular system, while having antiestrogen-like effects in uterus and breast. In this study, we investigated the effects of ospemifene on the uterine endometrium, vaginal maturation index and hormonal status in healthy postmenopausal women. The study was conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I study, where 40 healthy postmenopausal women volunteers were randomized to receive daily oral doses of ospemifene either 25, 50, 100 or 200 mg or placebo for 12 weeks. Vaginal ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy were performed and vaginal maturation index determined at baseline and at 12 weeks' visit. Serum concentrations of estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), parathyroid hormone and prolactin were determined from samples taken at baseline, at 4 days and at 4, 12, and 16 weeks' visits. Climacteric symptoms were assessed using 12 visual analogue scales (VAS) at baseline and at the end of the study. No clinically significant changes were seen in endometrial thickness at any dose level. Ospemifene exerted a very weak estrogenic effect on endometrial histology. On the other hand, it induced a clear estrogenic effect on vaginal epithelium. Among the endocrine parameters only FSH and SHBG showed significant dose dependent changes; FSH decreased and SHBG increased during the treatment. In general, ospemifene was well tolerated. The 25 and 50 mg doses tended to reduce climacteric symptoms, but no statistically significant differences were observed between different doses of ospemifene and placebo. The highest dose level (200 mg) induced more subjective adverse reactions, especially hot flushes, than lower doses. Our study suggests that a safe and well tolerated dose of ospemifene for potential clinical use may be between 25 and 100 mg.

At 12 months, both androgens increased muscle mass (mean change from baseline +3.5%, +5.8%, and -0.9% in testosterone, nandrolone, and placebo groups, respectively, P < 0.0001) and muscle strength (P < 0.05). Lumbar spine BMD increased significantly only in men treated with testosterone (4.7 +/- 1.1%, P < 0.01). There was no significant change in hip or total body BMD. Testosterone, but not nandrolone or placebo, improved overall quality of life (P < 0.001).

After the menopause, estrogen synthesis from androgens and androgen precursors by aromatase is the main source of circulating estrogens. AIM. To evaluate whether aromatase gene (CYP19)polymorphism affects circulating estradiol (E[Formula: See Text])levels, bone mineral density (BMD), BMD change or fracture risk. METHODS. A 5-year randomized hormone replacement therapy (HRT) trial on 331 early postmenopausal women (mean baseline age 52.7\u2005\u00b1\u20052.3 years). The participants consisted of two treatment groups: the HRT group (n\u2005=\u2005151) received a sequential combination of 2\u2005mg estradiol valerate and 1\u2005mg cyproterone acetate with or without vitamin D[Formula: See Text], 100-300\u2005IU\u2005+\u200593\u2005mg calcium as lactate/day, and the non-HRT group (n\u2005=\u2005180) received 93\u2005mg calcium alone or in combination with vitamin D[Formula: See Text], 100-300\u2005IU/day for 5 years. BMD was measured from lumbar spine and proximal femur (DXA) before and after the 5-year trial. All new symptomatic, radiographically defined fractures were recorded during the follow-up. The polymorphism (intron 4 TTTA repeat) of CYP19 was evaluated after PCR amplification of the polymorphic site. CYP19 polymorphism was divided into three repeat groups: short (length of 7 or 8 in both alleles; n\u2005=\u2005135), long (length of 11 or higher in both alleles; n\u2005=\u200547), and medium (rest of the values; n\u2005=\u2005149). RESULTS. Of the baseline characteristics, only physical activity was associated with CYP19 polymorphism (P\u2005=\u20050.04) and a borderline significance was observed with previous fractures (P\u2005=\u20050.05). In the HRT or non-HRT groups, the 5-year serum E[Formula: See Text] change was not associated with CYP19 polymorphism (P\u2005=\u20050.87 and 0.74, respectively). Further, the polymorphism did not influence the calculated annual changes of lumbar or femoral neck BMD during the 5-year follow-up in the HRT (P\u2005=\u20050.60 and 0.17, respectively) or non-HRT (P\u2005=\u20050.92 and 0.80, respectively) groups. In all, 28 women sustained 33 fractures during the follow-up. The CYP19 polymorphism was not significantly associated with fracture risk (P\u2005=\u20050.89 and 0.23 respectively; Cox proportional hazards model) in the HRT or non-HRT groups. CONCLUSIONS.CYP19 polymorphism was not associated with circulating E[Formula: See Text] levels, BMD values, or fracture risk in these early postmenopausal Finnish women.

A total of 2763 postmenopausal women with coronary disease and average age of 67 years at enrollment in HERS; 2321 women (93% of those surviving) consented to follow-up in HERS II. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 0.625 mg/d of conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 1380) or placebo (n = 1383) during HERS; open-label hormone therapy was prescribed at personal physicians' discretion during HERS II.

Estradiol levels decline intermittently during the perimenopausal transition and permanently after menopause. As a consequence, women experience symptoms related to urogenital atrophy, vasomotor instability, neurocognitive dysfunction, accelerated bone loss, and cardiovascular disease. For some women, vasomotor instability and associated insomnia are disabling. Vasomotor instability causes symptoms of hot flashes resulting from disruption of temperature regulatory mechanisms and associated vasodilation. Three quarters of white women experience hot flashes during the perimenopausal transition, beginning on average 2 years before the cessation of menses. Eighty-five percent of these women continue to experience hot flashes for more than 1 year, and 25% to 50% for as long as 5 years. 1 Hot flashes usually wane over time, but in some individuals they may continue indefinitely. Although demographic studies are incomplete, hot flashes appear to be more common in African American women than in their white, Hispanic, Japanese, or Chinese counterparts. 2 Interestingly, detailed studies of Mayan Indian women revealed that they reported no symptoms associated with menopause, perhaps because of their cultural attitudes toward menopause. 3", "outbound_citations": ["12440550", "12440557", "12117397", "12091218", "11980635", "11984098", "12000211", "11895055", "12017547", "11731510", "11822613", "11330770", "11145492", "11075748", "10417036", "9667254", "9651903", "9469333", "9418683", "8136666", "8317530", "1798794", "4033447", "6533433", "6725512", "6327190", "7145250", "7218488", "7211966", "7416212", "495671", "4693879", "4890348"], "inbound_citations": ["36244695", "31266379"], "label": "0"}

Memory, frontal lobe functions (inhibition and planning) and visuospatial abilities (mental rotation) were tested before and after treatment. Estrogen plasma levels were measured to confirm the result of EHR. Cortisol plasma levels were also measured before and after cognitive performance in order to evaluate the effects of EHR on the sensitivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to mild mental stress. Plasma estradiol levels in the drug group increased to levels equivalent to that of a fertile woman (0.21+/-0.5 nmol/l). Memory function as well as visuospatial abilities as measured by a mental rotation task improved significantly with EHR. However, there was no effect of EHR on frontal lobe functions. The cognitive effects were not dependent on an improvement in mood or general well-being as may be the case with EHR in women at peri- or post-menopausal stage. EHR was found to increase the HPA response to task-induced stress, as indicated by an increase in cortisol plasma levels.

Unopposed estrogen use is associated with a high risk (relative risk, 2.1 to 5.7) of endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma, and it has been understood for some time that a progestogen must be added for at least 10 to 14 days per month to prevent these effects. However, the most commonly used synthetic progestins, norethisterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate, have been associated with metabolic and vascular side effects (eg, suppression of the vasodilating effect of estrogens) in both experimental and human controlled studies. All comparative studies to date conclude that the side effects of synthetic progestins can be minimized or eliminated through the use of natural progesterone, which is identical to the steroid produced by the corpus luteum. The inconvenience associated with the use of injectable, rectal, or vaginal formulations of natural progesterone can be circumvented by using orally administered micronized progesterone. The bioavailability of micronized progesterone is similar to that of other natural steroids, and interindividual and intraindividual variability of area under the curve is similar to that seen with synthetic progestins. A clear dose-ranging effect has been demonstrated, and long-term protection of the endometrium has been established. Micronized progesterone has been used widely in Europe since 1980 at dosages ranging from 300 mg/d (taken at bedtime) 10 days a month for women wishing regular monthly bleeding to 200 mg 14 days a month or 100 mg 25 days a month for women willing to remain amenorrheic. This therapy is well tolerated, with the only specific side effect being mild and transient drowsiness, an effect minimized by taking the drug at bedtime. The prospective, comparative Postmenopausal Estrogens/Progestin Intervention trial has recommended oral micronized progesterone as the first choice for opposing estrogen therapy in nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Endometrial biopsies were performed to evaluate treatment efficacy. Questionnaires were used to assess side effects, including sedation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOn oral micronized progesterone, all patients had in-phase endometrial biopsies.

In preclinical studies, ziprasidone was predicted to have efficacy against positive, negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia with a favourable tolerability profile, including a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal adverse effects. The drug has been administered orally to >300 patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in published 4- to 6-week randomised, double-blind trials. When given twice daily at dosages of between 80 and 160 mg/day, ziprasidone produced significantly greater improvements in overall symptomatology than placebo. In the largest study, ziprasidone 80 or 160 mg/day was also significantly more effective than placebo in reducing negative symptoms and, at 160 mg/day, was significantly more effective than placebo in improving depressive symptoms in patients with associated clinically significant depression. Data from a 4-week trial indicate that ziprasidone 160 mg/day has similar efficacy to haloperidol 15 mg/day. Ziprasidone 40 to 160 mg/day was more effective than placebo with respect to prevention of impending relapse and improvement of negative symptoms in 294 stable patients with chronic schizophrenia who were treated for up to 1 year. In addition, significantly more ziprasidone than haloperidol recipients achieved a negative symptom response in a 28-week study involving 301 stable patients with chronic or subchronic schizophrenia. In general, oral ziprasidone is well tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. Importantly, the drug has a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a negligible effect on bodyweight. Ziprasidone is associated with slight prolongation of the QTc interval; the clinical significance of this is not yet clear. The drug does not appear to be associated with sustained elevation of plasma prolactin levels. Preliminary data indicate that long-term oral ziprasidone treatment is well tolerated. Ziprasidone is the only novel antipsychotic currently available in a rapid-acting intramuscular formulation. Short-term treatment with intramuscular ziprasidone was effective and well tolerated in patients with acute agitation associated with psychosis. In addition, intramuscular ziprasidone reduced agitation scores by a significantly greater extent than haloperidol in a study involving patients with acute agitation associated with psychosis. Ziprasidone is a promising new antipsychotic that has shown significant efficacy in the oral treatment of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The drug is well tolerated with a low propensity to induce extrapyramidal effects and a negligible effect on bodyweight. In addition, intramuscular ziprasidone shows efficacy and good tolerability in the treatment of acute agitation associated with psychotic disorders.", "outbound_citations": ["11691681", "11401000", "11235922", "11160792", "11206599", "12847582", "10771448", "10771449", "10771453", "10771458", "10771457", "10771452", "10771454", "10771455", "10771451", "10192829", "9860108", "9690695", "9430133", "9469675", "8930203", "10771456", "7562537", "1679253", "2571717", "2576319", "2872945", "8935809", "7530377", "7871035", "10771450"], "inbound_citations": ["29915922"], "label": "0"}

Subjects were tested four times, during the early follicular and midluteal menstrual phases, after 4 wk of combined estradiol-norethindrone (progestin) oral contraceptive administration (OC E+P), and after 4 wk of progestin-only oral contraceptive administration (OC P). The order of the OC P and OC E+P were randomized.

T(es) remained above follicular phase levels throughout passive heating and exercise during OC P, whereas T(es) in the luteal phase was greater than in the follicular phase throughout exercise (P < 0.05).

Irritability, tension, fatigue, depression, breast tenderness and bloating are among the most common premenstrual symptoms. Approximately 5-10% of women of childbearing age experience premenstrual symptoms to a degree that disrupts their functioning in the home or workplace and that meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Serotonergic antidepressants are clearly effective for PMDD, with about 60% of subjects responding to this treatment in controlled studies. Oral contraceptives are commonly used to treat premenstrual symptoms but are an understudied intervention with no information on their efficacy for PMDD). The recent introduction of an oral contraceptive (Yasmin, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany), containing low-dose ethinylestradiol (EE) combined with a new progestogen, drospirenone (DRSP), may offer clinical efficacy for PMDD as a result of the unique pharmacological profile of this progestogen, which is a spirolactone derivative with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity. A randomized, placebo-controlled study of DRSP/EE in women with PMDD found a consistently greater reduction of symptoms-from baseline for all 22 premenstrual symptoms assessed (using the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences, COPE) and for the four statistically derived symptom factors in the group taking DRSP/EE compared to the placebo group. For appetite, acne and food craving (factor 3), the difference between the DRSP/EE group and the placebo group was statistically significant (p = 0.027). These preliminary results suggest the beneficial effect of DRSP/EE on PMDD and offer an alternative class of medication that also provides the range of benefits of oral contraception for women with PMDD.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["28571724"], "label": "0"}

T-lymphocytes are capable of secreting bone resorptive cytokines and have also been linked with bone metabolism and the development of osteoporosis. Cytokine secretion from whole blood cell cultures was compared between two randomized groups of healthy early post-menopausal women (mean age 52.5 yrs, N = 91) and lymphocyte subsets were quantitated by flow cytometry. One group received cyclic estrogen-gestagen replacement therapy (ERT) while the other group was untreated. In spite of a significant bone maintaining effect of ERT, the basal and LPS-stimulated secretion of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-1ra was identical in the two groups. There was no association between cytokine release and bone mass or loss assessed over 2 yrs. The only exception was a weak estrogen-independent correlation between basal IL-1ra secretion and bone loss (r = -0.21, p < 0.05). Flow cytometry did not confirm a relationship between CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios and bone density or loss, and there was no effect of ERT on lymphocyte subsets. The number of CD3+ CD56+ T-cells showed a highly significant negative correlation with femoral and lumbar bone density in untreated women (r = -0.42, p < 0.01) similar to that found in patients with established osteoporosis, indicating that these adherent mononuclear cells may be important in the pathophysiology of post-menopausal bone loss.

The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included objective response (OR) rates, defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), duration of response (DOR), and tolerability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients were followed for a median period of 14.4 months. In terms of TTP, fulvestrant was as effective as anastrozole (hazard ratio, 0.98; confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.21; P =.84). Median TTP was 5.5 months for fulvestrant and 5.1 months for anastrozole. OR rates showed a numerical advantage for fulvestrant (20.7%) over anastrozole (15.7%) (odds ratio, 1.38; CI, 0.84 to 2.29; P =.20). Clinical benefit rates (CR + PR + stable disease > or = 24 weeks) were 44.6% for fulvestrant and 45.0% for anastrozole. Median DOR was 14.3 months for fulvestrant and 14.0 months for anastrozole. Both treatments were well tolerated, with 3.2% and 1.3% of fulvestrant- and anastrozole-treated patients, respectively, withdrawn from treatment because of an adverse event.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFulvestrant was as effective as anastrozole.

Clinical and research experience with estrogen-androgen hormone replacement therapy, as well as androgen-only therapy, suggests that the health benefit offered by androgen replacement exceeds the potential risk when treatment is properly managed. In this review, we concentrate on the effects of oral alkylated androgens. The virilizing effects (e.g., hirsutism, acne, voice change, and alopecia) of oral androgens are typically dose and duration dependent; androgen replacement at doses < or = 10 mg once daily administered for prolonged periods (> 6 months) produces masculinization effects that generally abate with dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. No clinical sequelae or irreversible pathophysiologic effects have been associated with any virilization that may occur. Changes in lipoprotein metabolism associated with oral estrogen-androgen use include reduced total cholesterol levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels which may reduce the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease. No clinically identifiable risk with respect to other cardiovascular variables, such as blood pressure, has been associated with the longterm administration of low doses of oral androgen. With regard to liver toxicity, reports of jaundice, peliosis hepatis, and hepatocellular carcinoma are extremely rare at the dose levels of androgen used in hormone replacement therapy, although individual sensitivity to the potential hepatotoxic effects of oral alkylated and nonalkylated androgen may vary considerably. Daily dosing with oral alkylated androgen in combination with estrogen is well tolerated. Retrospective and prospective studies involving the use of androgens alone and in combination with estrogens demonstrate that concerns about the adverse effects of androgen use associated with supraphysiologic, self-escalated doses in men do not apply to the much lower doses combined with estrogens for hormone replacement in postmenopausal women.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["36551674", "28454849"], "label": "0"}

Twenty-seven postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms were administered HRT in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study. The women received 2 mg estradiol (E2) continuously during four 28-day cycles and 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 1 mg norethisterone acetate (NETA) or placebo sequentially for the last 14 days in each cycle. The pharmacodynamic response to pregnanolone was assessed before treatment and during the last week of each treatment, by comparing the effects of intravenous pregnanolone (3\u03b1-hydroxy-5\u03b2-pregnan-20-one) on saccadic eye velocity (SEV), saccade deceleration, saccade latency and self-rated sedation. Throughout the study daily symptom rating scales were kept. During the progesta gen phase of the treatment cycles, negative mood symptoms and physical symptoms were increased, whereas positive mood symptoms were decreased. Compared to pretretreatment conditions, E2 alone did not change the responsiveness to pregnanolone. During progestagen addition to E2, the responsiveness to pregnanolone was increased. The sedation response increased compared to pretreatment conditions during both E2 + MPA and E2 + NETA treatment. Compared to E2 treatment alone, addition of MPA increased the postpregnanolone effect on saccade deceleration, whereas the SEV response to pregnanolone was increased during E2 + NETA treatment. It is concluded that pregnanolone sensitivity increases together with deterioration in mood symptoms during addition of progestagen to HRT.", "outbound_citations": ["11120505", "11113481", "10942479", "10505587", "10577620", "10465375", "10350029", "9757004", "9582073", "9659856", "9689453", "9626145", "9618754", "9508043", "9397425", "9197874", "9153163", "9203229", "9106373", "9286739", "9089849", "9141149", "8942834", "8860884", "7606242", "7714225", "7966923", "8030628", "8392205", "1310339", "1658700", "1653076", "1667729", "1665920", "2194047", "2334030", "2552344", "2539888", "3673611", "3801360", "2871819", "3513587", "2985131", "4061059", "3906106", "385093", "322905", "1237825", "5567806", "5360604", "4952012"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Convergent and discriminant validity were supported by correlations between Acne-QoL scores and clinical measures that were both in the direction and relative magnitude hypothesized.

The effect of hormone therapy on these measures depended on the presence (n = 434) or absence (n = 2325) of flushing at study entry. Women with flushing who were assigned to hormone therapy had improved mental health (+2.6 vs - 0.5; P =.04) and fewer depressive symptoms (-0.5 vs + 0.007; P =.01) over follow-up compared with those assigned to placebo. Women without flushing who were assigned to hormone therapy had greater declines in physical function (-4.2 vs -3.3; P =.04) and energy/fatigue (-4.6 vs -3.1; P =.03) over follow-up. Quality-of-life scores were significantly lower among patients with older age, diabetes, hypertension, chest pain, or heart failure. These differences in quality of life among women classified by clinical characteristics were much greater than the effects of hormone therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHormone therapy has mixed effects on quality of life among older women. The effects of hormone therapy depend on the presence of menopausal symptoms; women without flushing had greater declines in physical measures, while women with flushing had improvements in emotional measures of quality of life.", "outbound_citations": ["11578152", "11439947", "11331055", "11156873", "11152919", "11056097", "10787361", "10189323", "9872245", "9840563", "9718051", "9683309", "9492970", "10213541", "9187066", "9087469", "8827972", "8657237", "8674171", "7824251", "7996652", "7509570", "8455670", "8456888", "1443971", "1593914", "2782256", "2754790", "3398606", "3393032", "3814725", "3520318", "3728509"], "inbound_citations": ["36447434", "34908680", "34463192", "33631480", "33438886", "32509856", "29731182", "30277920", "31567867", "28805533", "28938425", "28650869", "28118068", "28093732"], "label": "1"}

Review of efficacy and adverse effects of commonly prescribed vaginal estrogens is of great clinical relevance.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA Medline (1966-present) search was performed for randomized controlled trials involving vaginal estrogens. Reference lists of papers were reviewed for additional references.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-two references were randomized controlled trials of vaginal estrogens used by postmenopausal women with signs or symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Subject numbers ranged from 20 to 251. Duration ranged from 2 weeks to 1 year. Different preparations and schedules were used across the trials. All treatments alleviated signs and symptoms of atrophic vaginitis, regardless of whether objective signs of atrophy were required for study entry. Data for urinary symptoms was conflicting; the ring may prevent recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The trials with endometrial scrutiny were less than one year and had mixed results. Nonhormonal lubricant is effective in improving some atrophic signs and symptoms. All preparations were associated with vaginal irritation. Bleeding with vaginal estradiol tablets may be less than that with CEE cream. Vaginal tablets or rings were preferred over other preparations. There were no serious adverse events reported. There was occasional expulsion of estradiol ring in the setting of prior hysterectomy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAll preparations are effective in decreasing signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy, but they differ slightly in their adverse event profiles.

After 4 yr of treatment, the smoking-treatment interaction was not significant between smokers and nonsmokers for the percent increase in femoral neck bone mineral density (P = 0.25), trochanter bone mineral density (P = 0.24), and spine bone mineral density (P = 0.37). The smoking-treatment interaction for reduction in vertebral fracture risk was not significant either [odds ratio for fracture, 0.67 (0.45-0.98) for smokers and 0.56 (0.47-0.68) for nonsmokers; P = 0.44]. These results were not modified after stratification by tertiles of body mass index or when comparing heavy smokers vs. light smokers. We conclude that smoking does not influence the antiosteoporotic effect of raloxifene.

This study evaluated the acceptability and effectiveness of a soy beverage containing phytoestrogens as a treatment for hot flashes in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in postmenopausal women with moderate hot flashes who were previously treated for early-stage breast cancer. Women were stratified for tamoxifen use and randomized to a soy beverage (n = 59) containing 90 mg of isoflavones or to a placebo rice beverage (n = 64). Women recorded the number and severity of hot flashes daily with a daily menopause diary for 4 weeks at baseline and for 12 weeks while consuming 500 mL of a soy or placebo beverage.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no significant differences between the soy and placebo groups in the number of hot flashes or hot flash scores. However, presumably because of a strong placebo effect, both groups had significant reductions in hot flashes. Mild gastrointestinal side effects were experienced by both groups but occurred with greater frequency and severity with soy. The mean serum genistein concentration at 6 weeks was significantly higher in women who consumed soy (0.61 +/- 0.43 micromol/L) compared with placebo (0.43 +/- 0.37 micromol/L) (P =.02). Overall acceptability and compliance were high and similar in both groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe soy beverage did not alleviate hot flashes in women with breast cancer any more than did a placebo.

Design Eleven healthy postmenopausal women recruited from the population-based study BEDA were included in this randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled hypothesis-generating pilot study, where the effect of transdermal estrogen (17\u03b2-estradiol, 100 \u03bcg/24 h) was tested. Methods Twenty-four hours after the patch with estrogen/placebo was attached, the blood pressure during rest and mental stress test was measured, together with blood samples for analysis of P-adrenaline and P-noradrenaline. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory registration of blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. Contractile properties and endothelial function of subcutaneous small arteries from gluteal biopsies were studied with the wire-myograph technique. Results Estrogen treatment reduced both ambulatory systolic blood pressure (5 mmHg, P = 0.05), diastolic blood pressure (3 mmHg, P < 0.05) and heart rate (6\u20138 beats/min during morning hours, P < 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure during and after mental stress was significantly reduced after estrogen treatment (P < 0.01). The levels of P-adrenaline and P-noradrenaline were similar in both treatment protocols. The contractile properties of the arteries were not significantly influenced by estrogen. Substance P induced nitric oxide-dependent relaxation in both estrogen-treated and placebo-treated precontracted arteries. Acetylcholine, on the other hand, induced a non-nitric oxide, non-prostanoid-dependent hyperpolarization, which was inhibited by potassium-induced depolarization after placebo but not after estrogen treatment.

Trimegestone has been developed for use in conjunction with oestrogen for postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The dose of trimegestone required for endometrial safety was optimised in a dose ranging study. Oral trimegestone was administered at 0.05, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/day, days 15 - 28 along with continuous oral micronised oestradiol at 2 mg daily. The majority of women in the four dose groups experienced relief of climacteric symptoms by the end of the third treatment cycle. The incidence of pre-menstrual tension-like symptoms was low and did not differ between the four dose groups. After 6 months of treatment, the bleeding pattern showed a clear dose-dependent modulation such that the higher the dose of trimegestone administered the more predictable was the day of onset of bleeding and the shorter and lighter the bleeding episodes became. This was further confirmed in another study comparing trimegestone in 0.5 and 0.25 mg doses to norethisterone acetate, where women on the 0.5 mg dose experienced more favourable bleeding pattern compared with the lower dose of 0.25 mg or to norethisterone acetate. In the dose ranging study, 96% of endometrial specimens obtained at the end of the study had secretory changes. The lipoprotein profile measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months during the dose ranging study confirmed the fact that trimegestone, irrespective of the dose, did not negate the beneficial effects of oestrogen on lipids.

Only one of these trials has been performed with a correct methodology (double-blind and with an adequate duration). In this trial over 2 years, the highest significant increase from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) at all sites was observed with HRT; in addition, HRT showed a significantly greater increase in BMD at lumbar spine than tibolone. Randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that tibolone produces positive effects on BMD. Nevertheless, no clinical convincing data are available to support its efficacy in the prevention of osteoporotic fractures. The positive impact on BMD of conventional HRT to prevent postmenopausal bone loss and to treat established osteoporosis has been shown by many randomized controlled trials. Regarding fracture risk prevention, some clinical and epidemiological data suggest that HRT initiated in early or late postmenopause may prevent fractures if it is administered at standard doses and continued for a long time.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHRT is always the reference treatment of postmenopausal symptoms related to estrogen deficiency.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOn May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 person-years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOverall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.", "outbound_citations": ["1617123", "12090863", "12090862", "11788212", "11680444", "11468217", "11485503", "11434726", "11451256",

One hypothesis is that testosterone enhances spatial abilities, while it might impair verbal skills. Thirty elderly men received a single testosterone (250 mg testosterone enanthate) or placebo injection. Cognitive performance was tested before and 5 days after treatment using spatial as well as verbal tests. Five days after injection, testosterone and estradiol levels were still in the supraphysiologic range. In the verbal fluency task, the placebo group, but not the testosterone group, showed a practice effect. Therefore, the testosterone group performed significantly worse than the placebo group after treatment. No effects of testosterone were observed in the other verbal and spatial tasks. The present finding, that testosterone blocks the practice effect in verbal fluency, partly supports the general idea that sex steroids modulate performance in tests with known gender differences.

Design: In a multicenter, open\u2010label, randomized, parallel\u2010group study, 159 menopausal women were treated for 24 weeks with either vaginal tablets or vaginal cream. Efficacy was evaluated by relief of vaginal symptoms and concentrations of serum estradiol and follicle\u2010stimulating hormone. Safety was monitored by the incidence of adverse events, evaluation of endometrial biopsies, and clinical laboratory results. Patients also assessed the acceptability of the study medications. Results: Composite scores of vaginal symptoms (dryness, soreness, and irritation) demonstrated that both treatments provided equivalent relief of the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. At weeks 2, 12, and 24, increases in serum estradiol concentrations and suppression of follicle\u2010stimulating hormone were observed in significantly more patients who were using the vaginal cream than in those who were using the vaginal tablets (p < 0.001). Fewer patients who were using the vaginal tablets experienced endometrial proliferation or hyperplasia compared with patients who were using the vaginal cream. Significantly more patients who were using the vaginal tablets rated their medication favorably than did patients who were using the vaginal cream (p \u2264 0.001). Patients who were receiving the vaginal tablets also had a lower incidence of patient withdrawal (10% versus 32%). Conclusions: Treatment regimens with 25\u2010\u03bcg 17&bgr;\u2010estradiol vaginal tablets and with 1.25\u2010mg conjugated equine estrogen vaginal cream were equivalent in relieving symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. The vaginal tablets demonstrated a localized effect without appreciable systemic estradiol increases or estrogenic side effects. Vaginal tablet therapy resulted in greater patient acceptance and lower withdrawal rates compared with vaginal cream therapy.

It is both potent and selective for the aromatase enzyme, with near-maximal suppression of serum oestrogens occurring at the clinical dose of 1 mg/day in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Anastrozole has also been shown to be a potent suppressor of intratumoural oestrogens, with responses comparable to those in serum. The results of two large, identically designed, randomised trials in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had progressed on tamoxifen showed that oral anastrozole 1 mg/day produced a statistically significant survival advantage over megestrol acetate 40 mg q.i.d. The median duration of survival was 26.7 months for anastrozole versus 22.5 months for megestrol acetate. Anastrozole was as well-tolerated as megestrol acetate, while weight gain was significantly increased in the megestrol acetate group compared with the anastrozole group. In another Phase III clinical trial involving 1021 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, anastrozole showed a statistically significant advantage over tamoxifen in median time to progression in a combined analysis of 611 patients who were known to be oestrogen receptor- or progesterone receptor-positive. Anastrozole was as well-tolerated as tamoxifen, with a low rate of withdrawals (2%) due to drug-related adverse events. In addition, anastrozole was associated with fewer thromboembolic events and episodes of vaginal bleeding than tamoxifen. For women with hormone receptor-positive tumours who progress on tamoxifen, anastrozole is superior to megestrol acetate. In addition, anastrozole is a reasonable alternative to tamoxifen for first-line endocrine therapy of advanced breast cancer. Recent data confirm an emerging role for anastrozole as adjuvant therapy for primary breast cancer in postmenopausal patients. Anastrozole is also being investigated in the neoadjuvant setting.", "outbound_citations": ["10674881", "7949201", "12718266", "12090977", "11745278", "11487258", "11352951", "11350888", "11577478", "11078487", "10873072", "10912575", "10619453", "10586340", "10731126", "10731114", "9888474", "9805213", "9752815", "9740079", "9605801", "9928565", "9045316", "9045315", "8883419", "8903429", "8683230", "8695256", "8814682", "8595172", "7626450", "7844613", "7804062", "10146895", "2150000", "738335", "856236"], "inbound_citations": ["36235277"], "label": "0"}

Bone mineral density increased significantly from baseline (P<.001) in the 1 mg NA-5 microg EE2 and the 1 mg NA-10 microg EE2 treatment groups at each annual assessment. Among the unopposed EE2 groups, only the 10-microg group had increased BMD above baseline, but also was accompanied by an unacceptably high rate of endometrial hyperplasia. The NA-EE2 treatment groups had a significant linear dose-response trend for increasing BMD. Increased endometrial proliferation and hyperplasia occurred with increasing unopposed estrogen doses. The combination of NA and EE2 effectively protected the endometrium against hyperplasia. The percentage of change in the ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was positive for all treatment groups. The increase in triglyceride levels associated with EE2 was attenuated with NA-EE2 treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDaily treatment with NA-EE2 was well tolerated and protected the endometrium from EE2-induced proliferation and hyperplasia. The NA-EE2 treatments produced a dose-related significant increase in BMD that was not present with unopposed EE2 treatment.

Therefore, the effects of dihydrotestosterone may differ from those of T in older men. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3 months treatment with transdermal dihydrotestosterone gel on muscle strength, mobility, and quality of life in ambulant, community-dwelling men aged 60 yr or older. Eligible men (plasma T < or =15 nmol/liter) were randomized to undergo daily dermal application of 70 mg dihydrotestosterone gel (n = 18) or vehicle (n = 19) and were studied before, monthly during, and 1 month after treatment. Among 33 (17 dihydrotestosterone, 16 placebo) men completing the study with a high degree of compliance, dihydrotestosterone had significant effects on circulating hormones (increased dihydrotestosterone; decreased total and free testosterone, LH, and FSH; unchanged SHBG and estradiol), lipid profiles (decreased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols; unchanged high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides), hematopoiesis (increased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red cell counts), and body composition (decreased skinfold thickness and fat mass; unchanged lean mass and waist to hip ratio). Muscle strength measured by isokinetic peak torque was increased in flexion of the dominant knee but not in knee extension or shoulder contraction, nor was there any significant change in gait, balance, or mobility tests, in cognitive function, or in quality of life scales. Dihydrotestosterone treatment had no adverse effects on prostate (unchanged prostate volumes and prostate-specific antigen) and cardiovascular (no adverse change in vascular reactivity or lipids) safety markers. We conclude that 3 months treatment with transdermal dihydrotestosterone gel demonstrates expected androgenic effects, short-term safety, and limited improvement in lower limb muscle strength but no change in physical functioning or cognitive function.", "outbound_citations": ["11134099", "10882873", "10686218", "10545314", "10509230", "10443654", "10442299", "10372695", "10087699", "9869674", "9823443", "9709942", "9703292", "9360543", "9351365", "9233903", "9211678", "9177359", "8923869", "8841644", "7491931", "7586603", "7671849", "7626464", "7733842", "8090165", "8126356", "7508622", "7979239", "8286893", "8326617", "8426037", "7687444", "1359209", "1430094", "1341460", "1400877", "1829756", "2229941", "2115044", "2787886", "2920848", "2493027", "3145819", "3310598", "3611032", "3546348", "2826899", "2446299", "3088241", "3935902", "6823267", "6352190", "7160922", "6163211", "511978", "4843734"], "inbound_citations": ["37118963", "36601008", "36547981", "35898448", "33842977", "33519525", "33081371", "32792984", "30888401", "29846604", "29465427", "29623702", "28159654", "28526632", "28472278", "28370068", "28149506", "27239418"], "label": "0"}

Design: This was a randomized, double\u2010blind, multicenter, parallel\u2010group study. One hundred forty\u2010five subjects, including naturally postmenopausal women aged 40\u201060 (who had not experienced menses for at least 12 months), women who had undergone hysterectomy, and women aged 25\u201060 who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy were studied. Either placebo or 17&bgr;\u2010estradiol (1 mg or 0.5 mg) was given orally every day for 12 weeks, and vasomotor symptoms and vaginal epithelial cytology were evaluated. Results: There were significant differences between placebo and the active treatments in the percentage change from baseline in the number of hot flushes (all hot flushes, 1 mg vs. placebo, p < 0.001; 0.5 mg vs. placebo, p = 0.007), with a more substantial proportion of subjects responding in the 1\u2010mg group (mean change in mean number of hot flushes of 83.2%). Both doses were also more effective than placebo in increasing the proportion of mature vaginal cells (end\u2010of\u2010treatment mean values of 0%, 78.5%, and 21.5% for parabasal, intermediate, and superficial cells, respectively, in the 1\u2010mg group; mean values of 0.3%, 80.8%, and 18.9% in the 0.5\u2010mg group; and mean values of 15.2%, 74.7%, and 10.2% in the placebo group). The proportion of subjects reporting no vaginal dryness was greatest in the 1\u2010mg group (mean percentage of days without dryness of 86.1% at weeks 9\u201012).

Two hundred and one postmenopausal women with severe menopausal symptoms were recruited to the trial. Women received either intranasal Aerodiol 300 microg/day (one spray delivery of 150 microg per nostril) or an oral estradiol 2 mg for 24 weeks. Severity of symptoms were compared based on the Kupperman index (KI) at the end of 24 weeks. The KI score decreased markedly in both groups between W0 and W24. At W24, the two treatments were shown to be statistically equivalent (P<0.001). The incidence of adverse events was very similar in both groups; those related to treatment were of mild or moderate intensity in 95% of cases for the nasal group and 90% for the oral group. In conclusion, pulsed estrogen therapy using Aerodiol is safe, easily used and highly efficient in alleviating postmenopausal symptoms with a dose of 300 microg.

Seventy-two postmenopausal women (mean age 64.9+/-0.5 years) attending metabolic bone disease outpatient clinics with established osteoporosis were randomly allocated into one of four treatment groups and monitored for 4 years. All patients enrolled in this study including the control group (n=18) received 1.0 g elemental calcium and 400 units vitamin D per day. The HRT group (n=18) received cyclical estrogen and progesterone; the etidronate group (n=17) received intermittent cyclical etidronate; and the combined therapy group (n=19) received both HRT and etidronate. BMD was measured in the lumbar spine and the hip before treatment and at 2 and 4 years after treatment. Changes in height were recorded, and the occurrence of new vertebral fractures were documented in comparison with the baseline radiographic evaluation. In 40 patients (10 patients per group), analysis of bone histomorphometry was carried out after 4 years of treatment. In patients who received the combined therapy, BMD increased in the lumbar spine by 10.4% (P <0.001) and in the hip by 7.0% (P <0.001) at 4 years. For patients treated with ICE, these increases were 7.3% (P <0.001) and 0.9% (P <0.05), and with HRT, the increases were 7.0% (P <0.001) and 4.8% (P <0.01) in the vertebrae and femora, respectively. The group treated with calcium and vitamin D lost 2.5% (P <0.05) and 4.4% (P <0.01) of BMD in the vertebrae and femora, respectively, after 4 years. Patients who received combined therapy had significantly higher BMD in both the vertebrae and in the femora (P <0.05) in comparison with patients who were treated with HRT or etidronate alone after 4 years. In comparison with patients in the control group, there was a trend toward a lower rate of new vertebral fractures in the treatment groups.

Pediatricians can help to decrease the teen pregnancy rate by increasing their knowledge of contraception and discussing sexual behavior and contraceptive use during health supervision visits.\n\nMost adolescents begin having sexual intercourse by mid- to late adolescence. Discussions of sexual behavior should begin in early adolescence before the onset of sexual activity so the pediatrician can help prevent unwanted pregnancy and its consequences. The patient interview should include questions about attitudes and knowledge about sexual behavior and appropriate counseling regarding prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), sexual responsibility, and contraceptive methods. The goals of contraceptive counseling are to promote healthy and responsible sexual decision-making. Abstinence should be encouraged as the safest and healthiest means of preventing pregnancy and STIs. The adolescent should be interviewed privately and office policies developed that assure appropriate confidentiality.\n\nIt is important for the pediatrician to initiate a discussion of contraception prior to the onset of intercourse because approximately 35% of teens are not using contraception at the time of first intercourse. Indeed, the approximate time between an adolescent female becoming sexually active and seeking medical services for contraception is 12 months. Unfortunately, approximately 20% of all adolescent pregnancies occur within the first month of initiating coitus, and 50% occur within the \u2026", "outbound_citations": ["11357157", "11325325", "11230601", "10545568"], "inbound_citations": ["30747979"], "label": "0"}

They are the best studied of all agents for the prevention of bone loss and reduction in fractures. They increase BMD, primarily at the lumbar spine, but also at the proximal femur. In patients who have established osteoporosis, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of vertebral fractures, and are the only agents in prospective trials to reduce the risk of hip fractures and other nonvertebral fractures. Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of fracture quickly. The risk of radiographic vertebral deformities is reduced after 1 year of treatment with risedronate [68]. The risk of clinical vertebral fractures is reduced after 1 year of treatment with alendronate [69] and just 6 months' treatment with risedronate [157]. The antifracture effect of risedronate has been shown to continue through 5 years of treatment [158]. Alendronate and risedronate are approved by the FDA for prevention of bone loss in recently menopausal women, for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and for prevention (risedronate) and treatment (alendronate and risedronate) of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Alendronate is also approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men.

Significant differences from placebo (p < 0.05, Dunnett's test) occurred within 4 weeks in Study 1 for hot flash frequency with a percent reduction in frequency ranging from 33% for placebo to 84% for both the 1 mg NA/10 &mgr;g EE and 1 mg NA/5 &mgr;g EE dose groups. Likewise, Study 2 significant reductions in hot flash frequency occurred by Week 2 for 1 mg NA/10 &mgr;g EE, Week 3 for 1 mg NA/5 &mgr;g EE, and Week 5 for 0.5 mg NA/2.5 &mgr;g EE (p < 0.05, Dunnett's test). This dose effect was also apparent with regard to severity. In addition, more subjects had clinically meaningful reductions in hot flash frequency or elimination as the dose combinations increased. ConclusionThere were significant reductions in hot flash frequency and severity with continuous treatment with norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol combinations. The time at which significant reductions were observed, as well as the magnitude of the response, were dose dependent. The opportunity for lower-dose options of a new continuous-combined hormone replacement therapy provides therapeutic flexibility for women who are recently menopausal.", "outbound_citations": ["9418709", "9255745", "8892714", "7599662", "7864968", "8008318", "8475965", "2309827", "2197954", "2538787", "2725334", "2498620", "3578449", "6738370", "6812347", "6805499", "7078891", "7272265", "7218488", "7253937", "6775094", "201958", "172181", "14890360"], "inbound_citations": ["35538479", "35069069", "33807739", "31621155", "28162779"], "label": "0"}

Four well-designed, international studies investigating the efficacy of pulsed estrogen therapy on both the short- and long-term consequences of estrogen deprivation were conducted. Climacteric symptoms and their reduction were assessed individually and also using the Kupperman index, which is a weighted score. Aerodiol produced a significant reduction in the Kupperman index and in the occurrence of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats. This reduction appeared to be significant as early as the second week of treatment. Moreover, Aerodiol remained effective even among highly symptomatic women with more than seven hot flushes per day, and also among smokers. Since it avoids hepatic first-pass metabolism, pulsed estrogen therapy also has a favorable action on the lipid profile, decreasing lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, Aerodiol is neutral with regard to clotting factors, angiotensinogen and insulin levels. The effect of pulsed estrogen therapy on bone has been assessed in both the short and the long term. Bone turnover, as measured by markers of resorption and formation, was normalized to premenopausal levels after 3 months of treatment at a dose of 300 microg/day. Aerodiol, again at the dose of 300 microg/day, is as effective as a 50-microg/day transdermal patch in increasing bone mineral density (p < 0.001 versus baseline) at the spine and hip after 56 weeks. Finally, data collected during the development of Aerodiol have shown that pulsed estrogen therapy is at least as effective as 2 mg of oral estrogen or 50 microg of transdermal estrogen in relieving climacteric symptoms and preventing postmenopausal bone loss.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

The study population was a subgroup of the Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention Study (OSTPRE) (n = 13100). A total of 464 early postmenopausal women were randomized to four groups: (1) HRT (a sequential combination of 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg cyproterone acetate (E2Val/CPA); (2) vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 300 IU/day); (3) HRT + Vit D; and (4) placebo (calcium lactate; 93 mg Ca2+/day). Lumbar (L1-4) and femoral neck BMD were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after 2.5 years of treatment. After 2.5 years, lumbar BMD had increased by 1.8% in the HRT group (p > 0.001) and by 1.4% in the HRT + Vit D group (p = 0.002), whereas lumbar BMD had decreased by 3.5% (p < 0.001) in the Vit D group and by 3.7% (p < 0.001) in the placebo group. The loss of femoral neck BMD was lower in the HRT (-0.3%) and the HRT + Vit D (0.9%) groups compared with the Vit D (-2.4%) and the placebo groups (-3.7%). This study confirms the beneficial effect of HRT on BMD. It also shows that low-dose vitamin D supplementation has only a minor effect in the prevention of osteoporosis in non-osteoporotic early postmenopausal women and does not give any benefit additional to that of HRT alone.", "outbound_citations": ["1627900", "7503183", "8686509", "7666817", "7733040", "7709944", "7714065", "7754811", "8217989", "1331788", "1309944", "1883119", "2203964", "2147736", "3417845", "2820619", "6756151"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "1"}

Thus, the aim of the study was to assess the effect of hormone replacement therapy on quality of life in postmenopausal women with essential hypertension by using a battery of standardized questionnaires.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe study population consisted of 53 women (mean age 50.9 +/- 6.3 years) with mild and moderate essential hypertension (mean duration 6.4 +/- 6.4 years). The postmenopausal status was defined as the absence of menstrual blood loss during > 6 months and blood estradiol concentration < 50 pg/ml, accompanied by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels > 21 U/I. Twenty seven women were blindly randomised to transdermal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and received 17-beta-estradiol and noretisterone acetate, TTS. Twenty six women were randomly selected as controls. The subjects were evaluated at baseline (after 2 weeks' wash-out from hypotensive drug period) and after three months of HRT using self-administered standardized quality of life questionnaires: the Psychological General Well-being Index (PGWB) and the Subjective Symptoms Assessment Profile (SSA-P).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo differences were found in blood pressure values, heart rate, body mass index and distribution of body fat tissue between women receiving HRT and controls at baseline and after 3 months of follow-up. There were no significant differences in the baseline total PGWB score as well as in its subscale between two groups. Similarly, the frequency and intensity of subjective symptoms assessed by SSA-profile were the same in both groups at baseline. After 3 months, a significant improvement in PGWB total score was observed in women receiving HRT. This effect was due to improvement in anxiety, positive well-being and vitality. Moreover, emotional distress, symptoms of flushing, sweating and trembling hands also diminished and sexual capacity improved in women treated with HRT.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA three-month hormone replacement therapy in hypertensive postmenopausal women slightly improves the general well-being, seems to decrease emotional tension, increase sexual capacity and markedly relieves some vasomotor symptoms.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37159867"], "label": "0"}

A literature search of English-language studies was performed using MEDLINE, a review of bibliographies, and consultations with experts. We identified 30 studies with adequate controls and risk estimates. Risk estimates were extracted by two authors and summarized using meta-analytic methods. The summary relative risk (RR) was 2.3 for estrogen users compared to nonusers (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-2.5), with a much higher RR associated with prolonged duration of use (RR 9.5 for 10 or more years). The summary RR of endometrial cancer remained elevated 5 or more years after discontinuation of unopposed estrogen therapy (RR 2.3). Interrupting estrogen for 5-7 days per month was not associated with lower risk than daily use. Users of unopposed conjugated estrogen had a greater increase in RR of developing endometrial cancer than users of synthetic estrogens. The risk for endometrial cancer death was elevated among unopposed estrogen users (RR 2.7, 95% CI 0.9-8.0). Among estrogen plus progestin users, cohort studies showed a decreased risk of endometrial cancer (RR 0.4), whereas case-control studies showed a small increase (RR 1.8).

We conducted a multicenter double-masked prospective randomized, placebo-controlled study in 595 apparently healthy postmenopausal women randomized to either placebo, or continuous oral estradiol-17 beta 1 mg or 2 mg with sequential dydrogesterone for 2 years. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) of actively treated groups compared with placebo. Women taking either 1 mg or 2 mg estradiol-17 beta showed a significant increase in BMD of the LS (mean +/- SD, 5.2 +/- 3.8% and 6.7 +/- 4.0% respectively, both p < 0.001) whilst BMD in the placebo group decreased (-1.9 +/- 4.0%). Increases were also observed in FN BMD in both treated groups (2.7 +/- 4.2% and 2.5 +/- 5.2% respectively, both p < 0.001) in contrast to the placebo group (-1.8 +/- 4.8%). The oldest women showed the greatest treatment response. One milligram estradiol-17 beta in combination with dydrogesterone is effective in conserving LS and proximal femur bone mass, both of which are clinically important sites of osteoporotic fracture, and is as effective as 2 mg in preventing FN bone. The lower dose of estradiol-17 beta is a particularly suitable treatment for osteoporosis management in older women since it should minimize side-effects and improve the acceptability of HRT.", "outbound_citations": ["10690860", "7588873", "7794851", "8157140", "8494850", "1581279", "1973969", "3035927", "6374537", "6756151", "7130340", "7247123", "7421945", "90802"], "inbound_citations": ["36626929", "35938207", "36357006", "32917180", "32747036", "30456623"], "label": "1"}

It leads to fractures that deeply affect the patients\u2019 quality of life. Osteoporosis is recognised as a leading factor in healthcare cost worldwide. For years, experts have recommended hormone replacement therapy (HRT), consisting of oestrogen with or without progestin, as the first-line therapy to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women. Recently published randomised, controlled trials and well-designed meta-analyses confirm that HRT has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. The disadvantages are the resulting adverse effects such as coronary artery disease, stroke, thromboembolic events, breast cancer and cholecystitis. In the light of these findings, medical associations recommend against the routine use of oestrogen and progestin for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women. HRT, administered for the prevention of fractures in all young postmenopausal women, would have an additional cost/year of life gained that is too expensive. However, this strategy seems to be cost-effective when young postmenopausal women at high risk for fractures are selected. Even if this strategy seems attractive, the adverse effects of HRT are not acceptable. This situation implies that other treatments must be found to prevent or treat osteoporosis. Among them, calcium and vitamin D were shown to be cost-saving in osteoporosis and even costs-effective in osteopoenia in young postmenopausal women.", "outbound_citations": ["8481586", "7703620", "14762196", "12642636", "12577187", "12602080", "12435221", "12418942", "12415431", "12186605", "12357731", "12181622", "12117397", "12117398", "12090862", "11992304", "11967146", "12654239", "11739424", "11846331", "11846333", "11401611", "11346808", "11172164", "11124760", "11444092", "11095442", "10996576", "10893688", "10746515", "10657327", "10527181", "10517716", "10320531", "10335731", "10231076", "10472854", "10624452", "10525713", "9718051", "9443925", "9467547", "9682800", "9841259", "10326069", "9531230", "9356729", "9040602", "9240722", "9425497", "8892714", "8797123", "7917575", "1502618", "1536215", "2024857", "1899896", "2119161", "2818106", "3657888", "7421945"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

However, in a subgroup of depressed patients, the decrease in B(max) for [3H]LSD binding during treatment was significantly more pronounced than in the nondepressed subgroup (P <.05).

After 13 years of follow\u2010up in national registries, 2,330 incident cancer cases and 848 cancer deaths were observed. Overall, our results were reassuring since incidence rate ratios (SIRs) for 16 cancer sites and mortality ratios (SMRs) for all 10 examined sites were at, or lower than, unity. However, we found that exposure to an estrogen\u2010progestin combined brand was associated with an increasing relative risk of breast cancer with follow\u2010up time, the SIR reaching 1.4 (95% CI 1.1\u20131.8) after 10 years of follow\u2010up. The relative risk of endometrial cancer was substantially increased, with the highest SIR of 5.0 (95% CI 1.6\u20135.9) in women prescribed estrogens alone, whereas those given an estrogen\u2010progestin combination showed no elevation in risk. The risk estimates for liver and biliary tract cancers and for colon cancer were reduced by about 40%, notably in women prescribed the estradiol\u2010progestin compound. Further detailed analyses revealed no evidence of adverse or protective effects on the risk of ovarian, uterine cervical, vulvar/vaginal, rectal, pancreatic, renal, lung, thyroid and other endocrine cancers, brain tumors, malignant melanoma or other skin cancers. Hormone replacement therapy was not associated with an increase in mortality for any cancer site, at this time of follow\u2010up. For breast and endometrial cancers, SMRs were below baseline but tended to increase with follow\u2010up time.

Two randomized prospective multicentre parallel group studies were performed (one in Germany and the other in Italy) in symptomatic postmenopausal women. The goal was to assess the efficacy on climacteric symptoms and the safety of a new estradiol (CAS 50-28-2) transdermal patch with solid active matrix (SAM) in comparison to a conventional liquid reservoir (LR) type estradiol transdermal patch. Both patches released 50 \u00b5g/day estradiol. One group of patients received the SAM patch and the other the LR patch in 4-week cycles, with a twice-weekly application of the patches for 3 weeks, followed by one week without patches. Progestin opposition was achieved with medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 mg/day orally in the last 11 days of patch application in the German study and with 10 mg/day in the last 12 days of patch application in the Italian study. Both studies were divided into two Parts: Part 1 with three 4-week cycles for a total of 12 weeks and Part 2 for other ten 4-weeks cycles in which the patches could be applied also continuously. The total duration of the study was therefore 52 weeks. Results. Germany study. 133 patients resulted randomized to the SAM group and 129 to the LR group. Both estradiol patches quickly relieved climacteric symptoms already during the first 3 weeks of patch application, as shown by the rapid decrease of the Kupperman Index. At the end of Part 1, in the SAM group 91 % and in the LR group 96 % of patients reported relief from climacteric symptoms. At the end of Part 2 the percentages were 98 % and 95 %, respectively. The two patches were therapeutically equivalent with a power greater than 99.7 %. Both patches were systemically fairly well tolerated. Only 4.5 % of patients in the SAM group and 3.9 % in the LR group discontinued prematurely for possible adverse reactions related to estradiol. There was no significant difference between the two patches with regard to systemic tolerability. Conversely, with regard to local skin reactions, the SAM patch was significantly (p < 0.01) better tolerated than the LR patch. The adhesion to the skin of the SAM patches was better than that of the LR patches. Results. Italian study. 139 patients resulted randomized to the SAM patch and 128 to the LR patch. Also in this study both types of patches relieved the climacteric symptoms already during the first 3 weeks of patch application, as shown by the rapid decrease of the visual analogue scale (VAS) recordings of severity of hot flushes and of sweats. At the end of Part 1 both patches relieved 95 % of patients from climacteric symptoms. At the end of Part 2, i.e. after 52 weeks, 100 % of patients were relieved from climacteric symptoms. Of these, 72 % in the SAM group and 78 % in the LR group reported complete disappearance of symptoms. Also in the Italian study, therefore, the two patches were found therapeutically equivalent. Both patches stopped or even reversed bone mineral loss in L2-L4 and had some favorable effects on lipid metabolism. Both patches were systemically equally fairly well tolerated with premature discontinuations for systemic adverse drug reactions in only 5.0 % of patients in the SAM group and 3.9 % in the LR group. Conversely, as in the German study, the SAM patches were significantly better tolerated by the skin (p < 0.0001). Conclusions. The two types of estradiol transdermal patches were equivalent in providing an effective and rapid relief from climacteric symptoms. Systemically both patches were fairly well tolerated. The SAM patches were significantly better tolerated by the skin. The better local tolerability combined with better adhesion and cosmetic properties render the SAM patches very patient friendly and improve the compliance in the long term estrogen replacement therapy required to reduce osteoporosis and cardiovascular risks.", "outbound_citations": ["11075300", "10093980", "9380093", "9351746", "9272245", "9125276", "8901155", "8532268", "8030628", "1443971", "1775081", "1953880", "1878265", "1898652", "2512035", "3139181", "3627576", "3568321", "3657875", "3928674", "2992278", "6110089", "6251107"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

In contrast, there were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures in the active treatment group.

(7) The increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism associated with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy was confirmed in these trials, even among women with no relevant history. (8) The WHI trial also confirmed the increased risk of breast cancer in women on hormone replacement therapy, but did not study its impact on outcome or mortality. (9) The WHI trial confirmed the beneficial impact of estrogen-progestin combination therapy on the risk of osteoporotic fracture. An average of 5 hip fractures were avoided each year per 10 000 women treated (10 versus 15 observed cases per 10 000 women per year), together with 6 symptomatic vertebral fractures (9 versus 15 cases) and 44 osteoporotic fractures (147 versus 191 cases). It is not known whether the benefit observed at the end of the trial persisted after the end of treatment. (10) In practice, the decision to prescribe hormone replacement therapy, and the optimal duration of treatment, must be weighed up according to each individual's risk factors. And the decision to treat or not to treat must be regularly re-assessed. Women must be informed of the potential risks and benefits, and must be monitored. They should also be advised not to use less well assessed treatments such as phytoestrogens, DHEA and tibolone. (11) Health authorities, especially in Europe, must organise comparative trials to assess the benefits and risks of other hormone combinations used by perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

We studied the effects of ospemifene on hormone levels, genital tract organs, climacteric symptoms, and quality of life. DesignA double-blinded study in which 160 postmenopausal women were randomly allocated to receive either ospemifene at three different daily doses (30, 60, or 90 mg) or placebo for 3 months. ResultsNo significant differences were observed among the study groups in clinical characteristics or parameters reflecting estrogen action at baseline. Ospemifene reduced follicle-stimulating hormone and insulin-like growth factor I levels, whereas estradiol failed to change at all, and luteinizing hormone was reduced only in the 90-mg group of ospemifene. In the vast majority of participants, the endometrium remained atrophic after 3 months of treatment with ospemifene. Although the rate of proliferative endometrium slightly increased in all groups, including placebo, no hyperplasia or bleeding occurred in any participant. Ospemifene had no effect on the appearance of proliferation marker Ki-67 in the endometrium as compared with placebo, and endometrial thickness increased by mean 0.4 to 0.6 mm (P < 0.01, P < 0.05 and P < 0.05 for 30, 60 and 90 mg ospemifene, respectively). Uterine volume slightly increased (8.4%\u201314.7%) in the ospemifene groups (P > 0.05), perhaps as a result of increased uterine blood flow. The most conspicuous finding was the significant estrogenic effect on vaginal epithelium, as evidenced by an increase in intermediate and superficial cells in repeat Pap smears. Ospemifene was not observed to aggravate climacteric symptoms or cause adverse events, nor did it suppress climacteric symptoms. ConclusionsOspemifene at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg did not stimulate endometrium or aggravate hot flashes but clearly had a rather strong estrogenic effect on the vaginal epithelium during a 3-month treatment period. Such effects would be advantageous if ospemifene were found to be effective in the long-term prevention of osteoporosis.", "outbound_citations": ["11261827", "12117397", "11397884", "11286468", "11172828", "11299809", "11044464", "11032589", "10890575", "10839558", "10874570", "10874566", "10704627", "10732328", "28200844", "10636511", "10650964", "10862264", "10214833", "9988395", "9776411", "9543133", "9385122", "9423751", "8954026", "8654638", "7824251", "1542321"], "inbound_citations": ["36917755", "36444726", "36672593", "33274517", "32074351", "31513780", "31291563", "31488961", "30895900", "30509754", "30509753", "30223003", "28509812", "28951854", "28628428", "28562130", "28267367", "28395337"], "label": "0"}

DesignThe study was conducted on outpatients according to a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. A total of 75 patients in natural or surgical menopause suffering from at least seven hot flushes per day were randomized to receive during 4 months either soy isoflavone extract (total of 70 mg genistin and daidzin per day) or placebo. ResultsThere is evidence to suggest that 16 weeks of treatment with soy extract can help reduce the mean number of hot flushes per 24 hours in menopausal women. Withdrawals during this trial made it difficult to obtain an unbiased estimate of the true treatment effect, but numerous sensitivity analyses lend support to the suggestion that taking soy extract can be beneficial in the treatment of hot flushes. In particular, women taking soy extract had a 38% reduction in the mean number of hot flushes by week 4 and a 51% reduction by week 8.

In this study we evaluated the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in symptomatic women in perimenopause.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe enrolled 100 healthy and symptomatic women who were randomly distributed to two groups for a 12-month study. Group A: 50 patients received HRT with estradiol valerate and cyproterone acetate (Pausene(R)); Group B: 50 patients were used as a control group (treated with Cacit Vitamin D30(R)). A number of clinical and instrumental tests were performed at 0, 6 and 12 months to evaluate any changes in vasomotor and urogenital symptoms, bone and serum homeostasis and possible sexual disorders. The statistical analysis was performed using the c2 test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe group of women receiving HRT showed a significant reduction in vasomotor clinical symptoms (p<0.001) and sexual disorders (p<0.002); this was not reflected in the control group where libido decreased steadily with apparent slight improvements only at the end of the study. The urogenital disorders disappeared almost completely in Group A, whereas they diminished in Group B. HRT patients also showed a slight increase (p<0.001) in the initial value of BMD (bone mineral density), a reduction in the marker for bone turnover and an improved lipid profile (p<0.05). These changes were unfortunately not noted in Group B.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOn the basis of these results we conclude that HRT appeared to have a beneficial effect on perimenopausal clinical symptoms over the 12-month period, leading to marked improvements in the psychophysical wellbeing of symptomatic women in perimenopause.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Methods: This was a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study. Generally healthy postmenopausal women with an intact uterus and no contraindications to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or tibolone were enrolled. Each subject was randomly assigned to receive CEE/MPA 0.625 mg-5.0 mg or tibolone 2.5 mg daily for 13 treatment cycles, each of 28 days. Results: A total of 85 subjects were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication, of which 76 (89.4%) subjects completed the study (n = 40, CEE/MPA; n = 36, tibolone). The incidence of postmenopausal symptoms decreased significantly over time in both treatment groups, compared with baseline, including significant decreases in the incidence of urogenital and sexual health symptoms. Significant differences in symptom control (other than hot flushes) were observed between treatment groups in a few different cycles for different symptoms, but no consistent or clinically significant trends were observed. No statistically significant differences in the incidence of bleeding were observed between treatment groups after cycle 4. Significant decreases in total cholesterol (5.6%) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (7.5%) were observed at cycle 13, compared with baseline, in the CEE/MPA group, and significant decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (8.5%) and triglycerides (13.7%) were observed at cycle 13, compared with baseline, in the tibolone group. Significant weight gain was observed at cycle 13 in the tibolone group (3.05 kg), compared with the CEE/MPA group (0.96 kg). The incidences of adverse events were similar in both treatment groups.

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether or not unopposed oestrogen reduces the risk of further cardiac events in postmenopausal women who survive a first myocardial infarction. The study was a randomised, blinded, placebo controlled, secondary prevention trial of postmenopausal women, age 50-69 years (n=1017) who had survived a first myocardial infarction. Individuals were recruited from 35 hospitals in England and Wales. Women received either one tablet of oestradiol valerate (2 mg; n=513) or placebo (n=504), daily for 2 years. Primary outcomes were reinfarction or cardiac death, and all-cause mortality. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were uterine bleeding, endometrial cancer, stroke or other embolic events, and fractures. Frequency of reinfarction or cardiac death did not differ between treatment groups at 24 months (rate ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.70-1.41, p=0.97).

The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) is an ancillary study of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials. On July 8, 2002, the estrogen plus progestin therapy in the WHI trial was discontinued because of certain increased health risks for women.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether estrogen plus progestin therapy protects global cognitive function in older postmenopausal women.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, WHIMS is an ancillary study of geographically diverse, community-dwelling women aged 65 years or older from 39 of 40 clinical centers within the WHI estrogen plus progestin trial that started in June 1995. Of 4894 eligible postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older and free of probable dementia at baseline, 4532 (92.6%) were enrolled in the estrogen plus progestin component of WHIMS. A total of 4381 participants (96.7%) provided at least 1 valid cognitive function score between June 1995 and July 8, 2002.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nParticipants received either 1 daily tablet containing 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen with 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 2145) or matching placebo (n = 2236).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nGlobal cognitive function measured annually with the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe Modified Mini-Mental State Examination mean total scores in both groups increased slightly over time (mean follow-up of 4.2 years). Women in the estrogen plus progestin group had smaller average increases in total scores compared with women receiving placebo (P =.03), but these differences were not clinically important. Removing women by censoring them after adjudicated dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or stroke, and nonadherence to study protocol, did not alter the findings. Prior hormone therapy use and duration of prior use did not affect the interpretation of the results, nor did timing of prior hormone therapy initiation with respect to the final menstrual period. More women in the estrogen plus progestin group had a substantial and clinically important decline (> or =2 SDs) in Modified Mini-Mental State Examination total score (6.7%) compared with the placebo group (4.8%) (P =.008).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older, estrogen plus progestin did not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo. While most women receiving estrogen plus progestin did not experience clinically relevant adverse effects on cognition compared with placebo, a small increased risk of clinically meaningful cognitive decline occurred in the estrogen plus progestin group.", "outbound_citations": ["8653109", "14762196", "12771112", "12707448", "12660385", "12566949", "12137675", "12117397", "12090862", "11834517", "11906203", "12017552", "11756599", "11526806", "11306202", "11309635", "11255426", "11156805", "11113299", "10987818", "10847257", "10858597", "10867223", "10449693", "10323642", "9875839", "9799627", "9699231", "9496988", "9491878", "9484355", "9492970", "9409335", "9269213", "9179095", "9106616", "9159769", "8780008", "8564321", "7576043", "8203802", "8054499", "8410037", "8487446", "1484915", "1961846", "2725334", "3249766", "3067252", "3611032", "2422758", "2990988", "7168798"], "inbound_citations": ["37205058", "37010830", "37061205", "36749328", "36737481", "36447434", "36374484", "36453774", "36318128", "36209948", "36029852", "35902963", "35928995", "35912083", "35807939", "35694859", "35616610", "35102101", "35093468", "35005701", "34642852", "34622524", "34631705", "34366807", "33655975", "33561436", "33345973", "34535618", "33655975", "33323410", "33269387", "33045914", "32900519", "32804095", "32677442", "35871709", "32542593", "32576368", "32297302", "32388179", "32207833", "32112728", "32047612", "31995690", "31759942", "33008519", "33008530", "31496308", "31418472", "31918850", "31744009", "31685499", "31581598", "30889096", "31326978", "30471324", "31063987", "30925299", "30814325", "30822161", "30041006", "30696877", "30570355", "30408169", "30355506", "30322209", "30201101", "29902481", "29852783", "29876339", "28977360", "29671495", "29316527", "28416813", "29952604", "29255847", "28755863", "29660935", "29234813", "28846767", "28983317", "28501655", "28322777", "28664754", "28359034", "28577965", "28531379", "28466687", "28757769", "28322310", "27436369", "27736018", "28353608", "28093732", "28074678", "28140404", "27506836", "31149152"], "label": "0"}

A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study was completed by 62 of 71 recruited healthy women. The first 3-month treatment period with either estrogen or placebo was followed by placebo washout for a month and then by a second treatment period with crossover to either estrogen or placebo. On a night after each treatment period, sleep was monitored with polysomnography, and breathing was assessed with a static-charge-sensitive bed and oximeter. For the respiratory variables, a sample size of 48 subjects was sufficient to give statistical power of 85% with a significance level of P <.05. The occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea in all women was low (1.6%), but partial upper airway obstruction, manifesting as an increased respiratory resistance pattern, was more common (17.7%).

The authors evaluated the effects of estrogen administration on plasma concentration of one by-product of APP processing, Abeta40, for postmenopausal women with AD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel-group design study, 20 women were randomized to receive either 0.10 mg/day of transdermal 17beta-estradiol or a placebo for 8 weeks and were retrospectively evaluated as to whether basal levels of Abeta40 were affected by pre-study use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Blood samples were collected and cognitive tests were administered at baseline; at Weeks 3, 5, and 8 during treatment; and again 8 weeks after treatment termination.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor the group as a whole, plasma Abeta40 was not reliably reduced in response to short-term estradiol administration.

Lowering bioavailable androgens may improve acne.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a low-dose oral contraceptive containing 20 microg of EE and 100 microg of LNG for the treatment of moderate acne.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, healthy female subjects (n = 371; >/=14 years old) with regular menstrual cycles and moderate facial acne were randomly assigned to receive EE/LNG or placebo for 6 cycles of 28 days. Acne lesion counts and clinician global assessment were performed at the end of each cycle. Patient self-assessments were collected and biochemical markers of androgenicity were also measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt the end of the study, the number of inflammatory and total lesions was significantly lower with EE/LNG compared with placebo (P <.05). Patients in the EE/LNG group also had significantly better scores for clinician global and patient self-assessments than those in the placebo group (P <.05).

DesignTo examine the effects of PL in comparison with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on lipid profile, sex hormone levels, bone turnover markers, and indices of cognitive function. For the study, 127 community-living, postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years were randomized to receive HRT (n = 43), PL (equivalent to 100 mg isoflavone; n = 45), or no treatment (n = 39) for 3 months. The following measurements were carried out at baseline and after 3 months for all participants: menopausal symptoms questionnaire; neuropsychological tests covering memory, attention, motor speed, and word-finding ability; quality of life (SF36); lipid profile; urinary deoxypyridinoline; dietary phytoestrogen intake and urinary phytoestrogen; estradiol; follicle-stimulating hormone; and luteinizing hormone. ResultsOnly participants in the HRT group showed a mean reduction in cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that was significantly different from that of the control group. No significant changes in lipid profile or follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were observed in the PL group compared with the controls. However, both the HRT and PL groups showed an improvement in Mini-Mental State Examination score and attention span compared with the case of participants receiving no treatment. HRT and PL had different effects on cognitive function; HRT improved delayed recall, whereas flexible thinking seemed improved in the PL group.

Dysfunction of central thermoregulatory centers caused by changes in estrogen levels at the time of menopause has long been postulated to be the cause of hot flashes. Treatment should begin with a careful patient history, with specific attention to the frequency and severity of hot flashes and their effect on the individual's function. For mild symptoms that do not interfere with sleep or daily function, behavioral changes in conjunction with vitamin E (800 IU/d) use is a reasonable initial approach. For more severe symptoms, the next step is to determine whether there is a contraindication or a personal reservation to estrogen replacement therapy. For women who are able and willing to use estrogen, it will successfully relieve symptoms by about 80% to 90%. In patients with a history of breast or uterine cancer, treatment with the progestational agent megesterol acetate appears to be a safe alternative that also decreases hot flashes by approximately 80%. For women unwilling or unable to use hormone therapy, one of the newer antidepressant agents can be prescribed. Venlafaxine decreases hot flashes by about 60%. Gabapentin is another drug that appears promising as therapy for women unable or unwilling to use estrogen, and the results of ongoing trials to determine its efficacy are eagerly awaited. The use of clonidine, methyldopa, and belladonna should be discouraged because of their modest efficacy and adverse effects.", "outbound_citations": ["12633537", "12090863", "12117398", "12117397", "12090862", "12079291", "11960518", "11929950", "11896107", "11851540", "11829697", "11867271", "11752354", "11694655", "11485503", "11451256", "11353785", "11352967", "11355041", "11445025", "11304788", "11368622", "11321955", "11245505", "11145492", "11154141", "11063896", "10880537", "10880548", "10914616", "10851385", "10908824", "10819701", "10775738", "10815929", "10785567", "10746892", "10694559", "10787361", "10690382", "10630125", "10432132", "10379749", "10411797", "10334534", "10614677", "10374221", "10100182", "9840563", "9846028", "9721791", "9718051", "9746385", "9667254", "9651903", "9576302", "9576289", "9469333", "9464712", "9489686", "9010105", "9007144", "8905606", "8848040", "7629229", "7898828", "8028614", "8308973", "8270972", "8401125", "8412840", "1503915", "1306400", "1398260", "1798794", "1888251", "1943887", "2263221", "3140150", "3185293", "3185294", "2967034", "3323851", "3304594", "3594101", "3884189", "3979577", "6318170", "6327190", "6407517", "6121983", "6793613", "6782116", "7416212", "462193", "447814", "76222", "922421", "921914", "900171", "194178", "961757", "1186789", "171569", "4854952", "4890348"], "inbound_citations": ["36949968", "36282199", "36338608", "35450004", "34792396", "34573064", "33618693", "32049930", "31987231", "31291984", "31266379", "30908403", "31196061", "31550247", "31151571", "29738420", "30056356", "29848424", "29332222", "30454602", "29067142"], "label": "0"}

One hundred sixteen women received continuous combined HRT and 119 women received tibolone; 72 and 76 women, respectively, completed 12 months of therapy. Both treatments effectively relieved vasomotor symptoms and reduced serum total cholesterol. Continuous combined HRT, but not tibolone, significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein levels. Both treatments reduced high-density lipoprotein levels, but the effect was more profound with tibolone. The initial bleeding score was higher for women taking continuous combined HRT; however, by the end of the study, the percentages of amenorrheal women were comparable.

Methods This 12-month, multicenter, open-label study was carried out at 12 study centers in Finland and Sweden. A total of 395 postmenopausal women received 1 mg estradiol in 1 g gel, daily, with oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg for the first 12 days every month (groups I and III) or every 3 months (group II). The main outcome measures were relief of climacteric symptoms, bleeding patterns and endometrial safety. Results All regimens reduced the severity of hot flushes, sweating episodes and vaginal dryness. In groups I and III, approximately 80% and 70% of women, respectively, had regular monthly withdrawal bleeding (excepting the first cycle), with irregular bleeding in 8.3% and 5.3% of treatment months. In group II, approximately 94% of women had regular tri-monthly withdrawal bleeding, with irregular bleeding in 10.7% of the treatment months. Endometrial hyperplasia was observed in 0.3% of women. More than 87% of subjects completed the study, and 97% of these rated the gel as acceptable or convenient. Conclusions Both the 1- and 3-month regimens were equally effective in controlling climacteric symptoms and protecting against endometrial hyperstimulation.

Participants were queried at baseline and annually regarding menopausal symptoms. Breast symptoms were self-reported, and uterine bleeding was recorded on a daily diary. Symptoms associated with menopause were relatively common among Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study participants, whose average age was 67 years and who averaged 18 years since menopause. At baseline, 16% of women reported frequent hot flashes, 26% vaginal dryness, 10% genital irritation, 55% trouble sleeping, and 53% early awakening. Women assigned to hormone therapy reported less frequent hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and trouble sleeping compared with women assigned to placebo, but more frequent vaginal discharge, genital irritation, uterine bleeding, and breast symptoms. The reporting of breast symptoms among women in the hormone group decreased from 40% at 1 year to 13% by the 4th year. Uterine bleeding was reported by 31% and spotting by an additional 33% of women in the hormone group during the 1st year of treatment; by the 4th year, these proportions had fallen to 11% and 20%, respectively. Symptoms typically attributed to menopause are common in elderly women. Postmenopausal hormone therapy reduces hot flashes, trouble sleeping, and vaginal dryness, but at standard doses in elderly women is associated with vaginal discharge, genital irritation, uterine bleeding, and breast symptoms.", "outbound_citations": ["10389719", "9935129", "10389720", "9840563", "9718051", "9683309", "9609575", "7617857", "8164926", "1565024", "2367623", "322905", "14327878", "14890360"], "inbound_citations": ["37091307", "36356400", "35651836", "34278662", "33878192", "33308634", "32150082", "31975617", "31497577", "30714849", "30363012", "30358724", "30358725", "29738420", "29899696", "28640158", "28783542", "28650869", "27824686", "27779568", "27676631", "28118068", "27664516"], "label": "0"}

It is available without prescription and taken with the expectation that it may have beneficial effects on strength, general well-being, libido, and quality of life. Although studies have shown that oral androstenedione increases serum testosterone and estradiol levels in men, the hormonal effects of androstenedione in postmenopausal women are unknown. We randomly assigned 30 healthy postmenopausal women to receive 0, 50, or 100 mg androstenedione as a single oral dose. After androstenedione administration, we made hourly measurements of serum androstenedione, estrone, estradiol, and testosterone concentrations during 12 h of frequent blood sampling. The mean change (+/-SD) in serum androstenedione area under the curve (AUC) was greater in both the 50-mg (79 +/- 39%) and 100-mg dose groups (242 +/- 184%) than in the control group (-29 +/- 28%) (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group and controls vs. 100-mg group). The mean change in serum androstenedione AUC was also greater in the 100-mg than 50-mg dose group (P = 0.0026). The mean change in serum estrone AUC was greater in both the 50-mg (108 +/- 72%) and 100-mg dose groups (116 +/- 119%) than in the control group (-5 +/- 19%), although the control vs. 100-mg group comparison did not quite meet statistical significance (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group, P = 0.0631 controls vs. 100-mg group). The mean change in serum estradiol AUC remained stable after supplementation in all groups without any between-group differences observed (-11 +/- 17%, 2.8 +/- 34%, -11 +/- 27%, for the control, 50-mg, and 100-mg groups, respectively). The mean change in serum testosterone AUC was greater in both the 50-mg (185 +/- 146%) and 100-mg dose groups (457 +/- 601%) than in the control group (-27 +/- 13%) (P < 0.0001 for controls vs. 50-mg group and for controls vs. 100-mg group). The mean change in testosterone AUC was also greater in the 100-mg dose group than 50-mg dose group (P = 0.0257). There was considerable individual variability in the changes of serum androstenedione, estrone, and testosterone levels in the treated groups with peak serum testosterone levels exceeding the upper limit of normal in 4 of 10 women in the 50-mg dose group and 6 of 10 in the 100-mg dose group. We concluded that the acute administration of both 50-mg and 100-mg of androstenedione increases serum testosterone and estrone levels, but not estradiol levels, in postmenopausal women.

Patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups. Group I (n=29) received 2.5 mg finasteride/day and group II (n=27) received 5 mg finasteride/day orally for 1 year. Hirsutism score, body mass index and hormonal parameters (FSH, LH, estradiol, androstenedione, testosterone, free testosterone, 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and sex hormone-binding globulin) were measured in all the patients before treatment and repeated at six-monthly intervals.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe hirsutism scores decreased significantly at months 6 and 12 from a mean+/-s.d. of 18.4+/-4.6 to 13.3+/-5.2 (P<0.001) and 18.4+/-4.6 to 8.6+/-4.2 (P<0.001) in group I and from 18.7+/-5.2 to 13.9+/-5.3 (P<0.001) and 18.7+/-5.2 to 10.3+/-5.0 (P<0.001) in group II respectively. No significant changes in the blood chemistry and hormonal parameters except estradiol levels were observed. No serious side-effects were seen in the two groups. In group II, estradiol levels increased significantly at 6 and 12 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, hirsutism scores decreased significantly at 6 and 12 months in both groups I and II.

We therefore investigated the vascular effects of long-term contraceptive DMPA in young women. Methods and Results\u2014Endothelium-dependent (hyperemia-induced flow-mediated dilatation [FMD]) and -independent (glyceryl trinitrate [GTN]) changes in brachial artery area were measured using cardiovascular magnetic resonance in 13 amenorrheic DMPA users (>1 year use; mean age 29\u00b14 years) and in 10 controls (mean age 30\u00b14 years, P =0.25) with regular menstrual cycles after validation of the technique. FMD and GTN responses were measured just before repeat MPA injection and 48 hours later (n=12) in DMPA users and during menstruation and midcycle (n=9) in controls. Serum-estradiol levels (S-estradiol) were measured at both visits. FMD was reduced in DMPA users compared with controls during menstruation (1.1% versus 8.0%, respectively P <0.01) without differences in GTN responses. S-estradiol levels in DMPA users were significantly lower than in controls during menstruation (58 versus 96 pmol/L, P <0.01). High levels of circulating MPA 48 hours after injection were not linked to an additional impairment in FMD (2.0% versus 3.1%, P =0.23). Estradiol levels were significantly correlated to FMD (r =0.43, P <0.01). Conclusions\u2014Endothelium-dependent arterial function measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance is impaired in chronic users of DMPA, and hypoestrogenism may be the mechanism of action. DMPA might adversely affect cardiovascular health, and in particular its use in women with cardiovascular disease should be additionally evaluated.", "outbound_citations": ["12777328", "11927524", "11591613", "11579370", "11576570", "11334896", "11248122", "11152852", "10960638", "10952828", "10920304", "10801756", "10779454", "10704159", "10362825", "10609824", "10545428", "10502813", "10509795", "9778328", "9743505", "9483230", "9055861", "8901703", "8622535", "8725700", "8725704", "1359209", "1533383", "1830502", "3495737", "6253831"], "inbound_citations": ["36603652", "35510324", "33161900", "32184733", "32037928", "29671344", "29587706", "29062782"], "label": "0"}

The aim of this trial, in which hirsutism was the primary end point, was to compare the efficacy of the oral antihyperglycemic medication metformin with that of an established treatment, combined ethinyl estradiol and cyproterone acetate. Patients (n = 52) were randomized to receive either metformin (500 mg, three times daily) or Dianette (ethinyl estradiol, 35 micro g; cyproterone acetate, 2 mg) treatment for 12 months, with assessments before treatment, at 6 months, and at 12 months. Both objective and subjective methods of evaluating hirsutism were used, and in addition, patient perceptions were examined. The results show that metformin is potentially an effective treatment for moderate to severe hirsutism in women with PCOS. They also suggest that in some respects (Ferriman-Gallwey score and patient self-assessment), it is more efficacious than the standard treatment (Dianette). The objective evaluation of hair diameter reduction showed that both treatments were moderately effective at multiple anatomical sites. Dianette treatment was responsible for profound suppression of androgen activity, in contrast to metformin, which induced negligible change. However, metformin did reduce markers of insulin resistance. The data suggest that hirsutism may be effectively treated by reducing hyperinsulinemia.", "outbound_citations": ["12519844", "12788588", "12153743", "12093831", "11836287", "12396556", "11779598", "11297595", "11239532", "10999803", "10946879", "10634377", "10856473", "10770203", "10490108", "10199797", "9637806", "9688382", "9215308", "9536208", "9165657", "8854583", "7608255", "7608381", "8006448", "1283982", "1324963", "3089520", "2868172", "13892577"], "inbound_citations": ["36108737", "35434762", "34268040", "33070640", "33048332", "32894455", "32794179", "32983332", "32544018", "31610858", "31081406", "31111484", "30524372", "29732746", "29020474", "30158805", "29329689", "29522147", "29466788", "28911368", "29293982", "29430464", "28447864", "27939359", "28081648", "31149153"], "label": "0"}

Estrogen/androgen (E/A) therapy is especially important for surgically menopausal women. This population group experiences marked bone loss in response to the dramatic decline in ovarian hormones. The resulting hormonal profile differs significantly from that of naturally menopausal women. For surgically menopausal women, the relation of estrogens, androgens and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is of special concern, as the interrelation between these hormones ultimately may reduce hormonal bioavailability. This paper reviews the relation of bone metabolism to ovarian hormones and the mechanics of BMD loss as well as the tools available to clinicians to assess bone loss in menopausal women. It further discusses androgen excess in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

In addition, the effects of interview stress and circadian hormone secretion need to be checked. In a pilot study on the overall sexual capacity of aging men, 48 randomly selected, healthy, heterosexual, cohabiting men aged 50\u201380 years, from Mannheim, Germany, and 50 from the State College, Pennsylvania, USA, were administered a standardized interview covering medical biography, present and previous life and work, marriage and emotional status. Two saliva samples were collected from each subject for measurement of testosterone, cortisol, estradiol and DHEA-S levels before and after the interview, and each subject completed a confidential self-administered questionnaire on intercourse, masturbation, orgasm, fantasies, libido and arousal. Questionnaires, hormone measurement techniques and the survey protocol had been extensively pretested. Prior to the pilot study, the kits for measuring testosterone and DHEA-S in saliva were checked for comparative validity against established measuring techniques in serum in 31 cases for testosterone and in 24 different cases for DHEA-S. These 55 cases underwent clinical diagnosis and were not otherwise involved in this study. The cases had been referred to the Andrology Unit of the University Hospital, Marburg, for reasons unrelated to this study. Given the biological differences for both steroids between their presence in blood and in saliva, a perfect correspondence between the two values was not expected and was not observed. The correlations obtained, however, support the assumption that all statistical relationships between testosterone and DHEA-S values in serum and clinical, as well as behavioral, variables reported to date may be replicated for testosterone and DHEA-S values in saliva.", "outbound_citations": ["12074505", "11979325", "11726480", "11465964", "11415846", "11356236", "11393496", "11306400", "11238497", "11250787", "11263673", "11159150", "11394242", "11910706", "11129755", "10996473", "11061502", "11091288", "11065298", "11064934", "11035380", "10975236", "11014714", "10964528", "11079360", "10904463", "11333422", "11034434", "10886490", "10782446", "10633536", "10941985", "10487717", "10207691", "10396490", "10049599", "10078790", "9766760", "9746274", "9604118", "9454317", "9507745", "9675779", "9627863", "9752108", "9216451", "8831046", "7586546", "8552737", "7760258", "7970303", "7801702", "8215053", "7508282", "1326421", "1719016", "2236282", "2145584", "2787886", "3817041", "6431849", "7468582", "13555876"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

The aged subjects received estradiol or placebo treatment for 14 days. All subjects were then exposed to the \u2018Trier Social Stress Test\u2019 (TSST) and the dexamethasone (Dex)-human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH) test (100 \u00b5g hCRH after premedication with 1.5 mg Dex). Psychological parameters including perceived stressfulness, mood and subjective well-being were measured by visual analog scales, a mood questionnaire and a mood diary, respectively. Results show that the TSST induced significant increases in adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), free salivary cortisol, total plasma cortisol and heart rates (all p < 0.0001). Regardless of age, comparable hormonal response patterns were observed in the TSST as indicated by similar peak levels and recovery phases. Visual analog scales confirmed that the same amount of stress was experienced by young and elderly subjects. In both age groups, hCRH injection after Dex premedication provoked significant increases in ACTH, free salivary cortisol and total plasma cortisol (all p < 0.0001). In contrast to the psychosocial stressor, elderly women were found to respond with a markedly enhanced cortisol response compared to young controls in the Dex-CRH test (p < 0.025). Additional investigation of morning cortisol profiles could not reveal any age-related differences in basal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Following estradiol treatment, estradiol levels significantly increased only in substituted postmenopausal women (p < 0.001) reaching concentrations typically found in younger women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Corticosteroid-binding globulin levels did not differ significantly between groups. When confronted with the TSST, no response differences emerged between the three groups. However, estradiol treatment appeared to blunt the total plasma cortisol response in the Dex-CRH test, resulting in smaller increases in untreated premenopausal women and estradiol-treated postmenopausal women compared to placebo-treated postmenopausal women (p < 0.02). In sum, no response differences were observed after confrontation with a psychosocial stress test in our sample of healthy elderly subjects. As shown with the Dex-CRH test, our data suggest that the negative feedback of the HPA axis in elderly women is altered. Moreover, the current data suggest that estradiol replacement may modulate HPA feedback sensitivity in humans.", "outbound_citations": ["10360139", "10204967", "9626555", "9589688", "9509493", "9416776", "9215274", "9060972", "9358882", "9787252", "8855815", "9044441", "8959239", "8675562", "8848517", "7582665", "7788010", "7733395", "7867564", "7877114", "8026389", "7838296", "8255414", "1472460", "1471706", "1658700", "1846870", "1846872", "1801504", "2215272", "3044718", "2966832", "3310061", "3527687", "3903822", "6661643", "7119063", "4378854", "14076206", "13756461"], "inbound_citations": ["34093447", "33709874", "31847138", "30480877", "29631362", "29941883", "29875390", "28864234", "28284896", "27989716"], "label": "0"}

Other nutrients also affect bone health, and adequate intakes may influence bone turnover and balance.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe compared the long-term effects on bone turnover markers and calciotropic hormones of a multinutrient supplement, a calcium and vitamin D supplement, and dietary instruction aimed at increasing calcium intake through foods.\n\n\nDESIGN\nNinety-nine healthy postmenopausal women participated in a 3-y, randomized trial, receiving either 1) supplemental calcium (1450 mg/d) and vitamin D [10 microg (400 IU)/d], 2) calcium, vitamin D, and other nutrients (multinutrient supplement), or 3) dietary instruction (dietary control group). Data are from 83 subjects who completed the trial.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIncreases over baseline in calcium intakes and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were sustained over 3 y in all treatment groups. Circulating parathyroid hormone concentrations were reduced at year 1 in all treatment groups but trended toward baseline thereafter. Bone turnover markers followed a similar pattern, and none of the changes in biochemical concentrations differed significantly between groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAll 3 interventions offer long-term feasibility for increasing calcium intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. The dietary addition of micronutrients implicated in skeletal physiology confers no obvious bone-sparing effect in healthy postmenopausal women beyond that of calcium and vitamin D alone. The attenuation over time in suppression of parathyroid hormone and bone turnover might help explain why nutrient intervention tends to have less of a bone-sparing effect than do skeletally active medications such as estrogen or bisphosphonates.", "outbound_citations": ["1422948", "9665115", "9495509", "10197175", "9278463", "9101380", "8970899", "8669418", "8619364", "7543494", "7484282", "7733040", "7709944", "7714065", "7519191", "8027856", "8256988", "8077337", "8421475", "1331788", "1637023", "1603140", "1729617", "1883119", "2203964", "3678698", "5474144", "5810830", "4875720", "14463214"], "inbound_citations": ["32451694", "32443563", "29460100", "32625486"], "label": "0"}

This has been attributed to increased muscle strength by HRT. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of 6 months of HRT on muscle strength in postmenopausal women. Forty postmenopausal women, aged 60-78 were included in the study. They were randomly divided in two groups with 20 women in each group. One group received Menorest 50 microg/24 h (estradiol 4.3 mg) and Gestapuran 2.5 mg (medroxyprogesteron) daily and the other group received placebo treatment. The study was conducted as a double blinded, prospective and placebo controlled trial. Hand grip strength, isokinetic knee flexion and extention, and physical activity were measured before treatment, after 3 and 6 months. Physical activity was estimated using a classification system of physical activity. A JAMAR hydraulic hand dynamometer and a Cybex II dynamometer were used to evaluate muscle strength. Hand grip strength in the right hand, increased significantly in both groups (HRT P<0.001 and placebo P<0.01) and in the left hand in the HRT group (P<0.01). However, there were no differences in muscle strength between the two groups. There was no significant change in isokinetic knee flexion or extension after 6 months in either of the groups. The estimated physical activity increased slightly in the placebo group, but there was no significant difference compared to the treatment group.

Estrogen treatment in the postmenopausal woman has several proven benefits for those who have vasomotor symptoms or problems related to urogenital atrophy. However, the most controversial area is in the long-term preventive benefits of estrogen against the development of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, particularly in women older than 60 years. It is in these areas that decisions on the dose and optimal route of administration of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) must be made. Although adding a progestogen to an ERT regimen is mandatory, particularly in a woman with an intact uterus, discussion now focuses on which progestogen least attenuates the beneficial effects of estrogen. Emerging trends suggest that lower doses of estrogen (i.e. ethinylestradiol 5 microg/day, estradiol 0.25 mg/day or conjugated estrogens [CEE] 0.3 mg/day) continuously combined with lower doses of medroxyprogesterone (MPA) are equally effective at relieving vasomotor symptoms as the most commonly prescribed regimen in the US (CEE 0.625mg/MPA 2.5mg daily), with fewer adverse events, leading to greater patient acceptance and likelihood for continuation of therapy. This is especially important when therapy is initiated at an older age.", "outbound_citations": ["6374537", "2335104", "3574823", "11438314", "9531230", "9774760", "11600531", "11334901", "10756506", "11397883", "1508062", "10472853", "7935028", "12020302", "10594527", "9718051", "11438315", "10954771", "10893653", "1948834", "10868559", "11384629", "8841224", "12117403", "11770191", "7752947", "9840563", "10375338", "11739424", "1536215", "10890791", "9158080", "12117397", "7807658", "10617250", "11497535", "11045872", "11696469", "10617249", "3541623", "6291439", "2244855", "1929686", "11084175", "10775738", "11694148", "10649155", "8164926", "11384630", "11434726", "10960625", "7599662", "10954759", "8569016", "7608645", "11401611", "9240593", "11506834", "10997482", "3789576", "10334256", "10486799", "8892714", "7158232", "11907914"], "inbound_citations": ["36585504"], "label": "0"}

The changes in Kupperman Index (primary efficacy variable), hot flushes and urogenital symptom score were studied from baseline to the end of the study. In addition, skin tolerability was assessed and patients were also asked to grade the subjective acceptance of therapy. A reduction in Kupperman Index was observed in both groups, and at each cycle of the placebo-controlled treatment phase the 7-day-Estradiol patch was superior compared with placebo (last value vs. baseline P = 0.0006). From the second treatment week onwards a distinct difference was noted in the reduction of hot flushes from baseline between the 7-day-Estradiol patch group and the placebo group. The difference between the groups was statistically significant for each cycle and at the end of the controlled treatment phase (mean weekly hot flush reduction at the end of the placebo-controlled treatment phase: -32.5 for the 7-day-Estradiol patch vs. -22.0 for placebo, P = 0.0025).

Two markers of bone formation, osteocalcin (OC) and bone alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), and two markers of bone resorption, urinary N-telopeptide (NTx) and urinary free deoxypyridinoline (fDpd), as well as spine and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Women receiving HRT (n = 105) showed a significant increase in spine BMD (+2.5%; P < 0.0001) and hip BMD (+1.0%; P = 0.02) compared to women receiving CS, who showed a decline at both sites (-1.1%; P < 0.01). All four markers showed time-dependent decreases in women receiving HRT (P < 0.001) and no change in women receiving CS alone. When baseline indexes of turnover were stratified by quartile, there was a significantly greater increase in BMD among those with the highest NTx, OC, and BSAP levels compared to that in those with the lowest NTx, OC, and BSAP levels (P < 0.05). The highest quartile for percent change from baseline to 6 months in fDpd, BSAP, and NTx was also associated with the greatest change in spine BMD at 1 yr. Receiver operator characteristic curves for percent change from baseline to 6 months in an individual marker to 1 yr change in BMD during HRT revealed that the percent change in NTx provided the greatest discrimination between gain and loss of BMD. When subjects receiving HRT were compared by their positive or negative skeletal response at 1 yr and their baseline turnover marker, initial NTx values were significantly higher in those that gained bone than in those that lost bone (P = 0.0002). CS women in the highest quartile for NTx at baseline had significantly greater decreases in spine BMD than subjects with the lowest NTx values (P < 0.005), although this was not true for fDpd (P < 0.20). In conclusion, for early postmenopausal women there are differential responses of biochemical markers to HRT and CS. Baseline urinary NTx and serum OC were the most sensitive predictors of change in spine BMD after 1 yr of either HRT or CS. Similarly, the percent change in NTx and OC from baseline to 6 months best predicted bone gain or loss. We conclude that markers of bone formation and resorption can be used clinically to predict future BMD in early postmenopausal women.", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35717745", "35621313", "34320706", "34645447", "33508495", "33293983", "31881044", "31141196", "31450694", "31207656", "30875838", "30089481", "30237996", "29961742", "29738833", "29075333", "28444666"], "label": "1"}

DesignThis double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study enrolled 355 nonosteoporotic postmenopausal women who had been hysterectomized with or without oophorectomy at least 12 months earlier. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three doses of the EMTDS (0.025, 0.05, or 0.075 mg/day) or placebo administered twice weekly. Lumbar bone mineral density (LBMD) was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at screening and after 1 and 2 years of treatment. Safety was assessed at regularly scheduled visits. ResultsEMTDS provided statistically significant and clinically meaningful changes in LBMD relative to placebo. At 2 years, LBMD declined from baseline by 0.59% in the placebo group, but it increased from baseline by 1.65% (p = 0.0065), 4.08% (p = 0.0001), and 4.82% (p = 0.0001) in the EMTDS 0.025, 0.05, and 0.075 mg/day groups, respectively. The corresponding responder rates (defined as no change or increase in LBMD at endpoint) were 39.7% for placebo, 59.6%, 79.3%, and 83.9% in the EMTDS 0.025, 0.05, and 0.075 mg/day groups, respectively. Mean serum E2 concentrations were proportional to the dose of the E2 transdermal system and did not accumulate over the course of the study. Adverse events were generally comparable across treatment groups, with the majority being mild or moderate in severity and unrelated to study medication. Mammogram findings and other safety assessments were also comparable across groups and did not reveal any safety concerns with 2-y transdermal E2 treatment.

There have been no large, controlled trials of treatment in men.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a two-year double-blind trial, we studied the effect of 10 mg of alendronate or placebo, given daily, on bone mineral density in 241 men (age, 31 to 87 years; mean, 63) with osteoporosis. Approximately one third had low serum free testosterone concentrations at base line; the rest had normal concentrations. Men with other secondary causes of osteoporosis were excluded. All the men received calcium and vitamin D supplements. The main outcome measures were the percent changes in lumbar-spine, hip, and total-body bone mineral density.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe men who received alendronate had a mean (+/-SE) increase in bone mineral density of 7.1+/-0.3 percent at the lumbar spine, 2.5+/-0.4 percent at the femoral neck, and 2.0+/-0.2 percent for the total body (P<0.001 for all comparisons with base line). In contrast, men who received placebo had an increase in lumbar-spine bone mineral density of 1.8+/-0.5 percent (P<0.001 for the comparison with base line) and no significant changes in femoral-neck or total-body bone mineral density. The increase in bone mineral density in the alendronate group was greater than that in the placebo group at all measurement sites (P<0.001). The incidence of vertebral fractures was lower in the alendronate group than in the placebo group (0.8 percent vs. 7.1 percent, P=0.02). Men in the placebo group had a 2.4-mm decrease in height, as compared with a decrease of 0.6 mm in the alendronate group (P=0.02). Alendronate was generally well tolerated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn men with osteoporosis, alendronate significantly increases spine, hip, and total-body bone mineral density and helps prevent vertebral fractures and decreases in height.", "outbound_citations": ["11212161", "11028437", "11000340", "10793867", "10555025", "10366118", "10550467", "9874784", "9844110", "9661593", "9600795", "9578891", "9383693", "9383679", "9351879", "9241127", "9195538", "9087473", "8950879", "8797123", "7477143", "7554702", "7709931", "7572326", "1640955"], "inbound_citations": ["36879208", "36869154", "36847867", "36651943", "36596944", "36592473", "36382763", "36190391", "35961836", "35909215", "35900607", "35896694", "35841491", "35378630", "35247315", "34968764", "34632530", "34490915", "34023041", "33821467", "33739919", "33568650", "33657753", "33200257", "33240217", "33129881", "33162933", "32870946", "32707115", "32734512", "32588816", "32606647", "32483674", "32335412", "32222607", "32060897", "32916023", "31958428", "31320223", "31177207", "31820173", "31938732", "31731933", "31378452", "31516917", "31447677", "31022626", "30827469", "30723121", "30674078", "29532248", "30542797", "30449553", "29931216", "29522088", "29318649", "29499097", "29266368", "29386866", "29350069", "29530627", "29535939", "29196083", "28881479", "28492856", "28721134", "28598810", "28425085", "28392857", "27210803", "28408926", "27058577", "28304090", "28326300"], "label": "0"}

OPG has been shown to be an important inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation and activation in rodent models. Estrogen is known to suppress bone resorption, and the action of estrogen on bone may be mediated by OPG. The relationship between endogenous estrogen and circulating OPG levels and bone status in human populations is unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between biochemical markers of bone turnover and bone density and circulating OPG and endogenous estradiol levels in a population-based cohort of postmenopausal women. Subjects were 180 women ages 55-91 yr (mean age, 67 yr). Serum estradiol was measured using an auto-analyzer. Serum concentrations of OPG were determined by ELISA. Markers of bone formation and resorption were measured by standard methods. Bone mineral density at total body, total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. There was a significant inverse relationship between estradiol and all bone turnover markers (r-values from -0.46 to -0.23; P < 0.05). Serum estradiol was positively related to absolute bone density at all sites and to change in bone density at the hip and femoral neck by univariate analysis (r-values from 0.15-0.29; P < 0.05). We observed a weak inverse association between OPG and serum-based bone turnover markers (r-values -0.18 and -0.16; P < 0.05). There was a significant positive relationship between OPG and bone mineral density at total body, total hip, and femoral neck (r-values from 0.17-0.2; P < 0.05) by univariate analysis, which was lost after adjustment for age and body mass index. There was a significant weak positive relationship between circulating OPG and serum estradiol (r = 0.18; P < 0.02). We observed no significant relationships between OPG and bone turnover markers measured in urine. We conclude that the variation in circulating endogenous estradiol levels is an important factor contributing to levels of bone turnover and bone density at the menopause. Our observations also suggest that circulating levels of OPG may reflect OPG activity in bone and are related to circulating endogenous levels of estradiol. We have previously reported high levels of variability in urine markers of bone resorption, and we suggest that this could account for the absence of a significant association between these markers and circulating OPG.", "outbound_citations": ["11595622", "11472888", "11443182", "11485016", "11375772", "11274028", "11204435", "11158021", "10977003", "10934651", "10465311", "10234572", "9783546", "9661076", "9647741", "28200649", "9520411", "9607769", "9168977", "9108485", "8110529"], "inbound_citations": ["37106043", "35893092", "35910035", "35418083", "35103405", "33586001", "32905775", "33455197", "33178863", "31463043", "31258673", "30721950", "29485684", "29725510", "28585053", "28173834"], "label": "0"}

Earlier clinical trials demonstrated that rizatriptan 5 or 10mg is more effective than placebo at providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated symptoms of migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient quality of life, and showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recently, rizatriptan 10mg was shown to be more effective than zolmitriptan 2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at producing a pain-free state 2 hours postdose. Furthermore, compared with naratriptan, significantly more patients who received rizatriptan were pain free or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. The number of patients with normal functional ability at 2 hours was significantly higher after rizatriptan than after naratriptan or zolmitriptan. Rizatriptan was also generally more effective than zolmitriptan or naratriptan at relieving migraine-associated symptoms. Rizatriptan is generally well tolerated, and adverse events are usually mild and transient. The most common adverse events associated with rizatriptan in recent randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. There was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with rizatriptan compared with zolmitriptan (31.2 vs 38.8%). However, rizatriptan was associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan (39 vs 29%). The incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of rizatriptan, zolmitriptan or naratriptan (2-4%). In conclusion, rizatriptan is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. Oral rizatriptan 5 and 10mg have shown greater efficacy than placebo in providing pain relief, an absence of pain, relief from associated symptoms, normal functional ability and an improvement in patient quality of life. Earlier results showed that rizatriptan provides faster freedom from pain and reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. More recent studies have shown that rizatriptan 10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage of patients with an absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than naratriptan 2.5mg or zolmitriptan 2.5mg. The efficacy of rizatriptan is retained when used in the long term, and the drug is generally well tolerated. Although well designed studies comparing rizatriptan with almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan would further define the position of rizatriptan, current data suggest that rizatriptan should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management of migraine.", "outbound_citations": ["11680669", "11728541", "11673575", "11576198", "11487512", "11453892", "11549974", "11264686", "11061582", "10908770", "11037741", "10709161", "10631625", "11089513", "10611145", "10529545", "10551439", "10417495", "10233200", "11563413", "11284462", "11284463", "9748025", "9595867", "9350384", "9203569", "9225275", "9056052", "10403069"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

As an anabolic agent, its potential might be substantially greater than that of antiresorptive agents. Clear evidence in human trials now documents the ability of PTH to stimulate cancellous bone formation and to reduce fractures. Because antiresorptive agents and PTH work by distinct mechanisms of action, it is possible that the combination of these agents could be significantly more potent than either agent alone. There are other unanswered questions about PTH. More studies are needed to document an anabolic effect on cortical bone. In addition, more large-scale studies are needed to further determine the reduction in nonvertebral fractures with PTH, especially at the hip. More information is also required to determine the possible need for antiresorptive therapy after PTH. Protocols to consider PTH as an intermittent recycling therapy would be of interest. In the future, PTH is likely to be modified for easier and more targeted delivery. Oral or transdermal delivery systems may become available. Recently, Gowen et al [78] have described an oral calcilytic molecule that antagonizes the parathyroid cell calcium receptor, thus stimulating the endogenous release of PTH. This approach could represent a novel endogenous delivery system for intermittent PTH administration. Ultimately, when the anabolic and catabolic mechanisms of PTH can be clearly distinguished, both mechanistically and in molecular terms, it may be possible to develop PTH analogs that are more purely anabolic.", "outbound_citations": ["8461561", "8461559", "12213840", "12096828", "12009011", "12051548", "11585349", "28201307", "11346808", "11341338", "11248653", "11277262", "11149480", "11062357", "10999788", "10852440", "10852439", "10841518", "10804025", "10804015", "10843172", "10543998", "10528034", "10449436", "10323380", "9933469", "9494781", "9788977", "9568710", "9528728", "9284699", "9284698", "9284777", "18406808", "9177866", "7477143", "7502712", "7756054", "7747618", "8450043", "1442205", "1532281", "1662460", "1868270", "1645259", "2318948", "2192751", "2763869", "3358404", "3503551", "7056211", "7298851", "6992932"], "inbound_citations": ["36984115", "36435911", "36054133", "35891832", "34905675", "33559713", "33357776", "33101657", "32426199", "32111549", "31429640", "30218587", "29782843", "30126106", "29365099", "35539368", "29541794", "29362267", "29395991", "28293779", "28815779", "28467646", "28280735", "28062525"], "label": "0"}

Hormone/estrogen replacement therapy (HRT/ERT) has a positive effect on both postcranial and oral bone. The objective of the study was to determine if the positive effect of HRT/ERT on alveolar crest height (ACH) is generalized or site specific.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe sample consisted of 49 women who completed a 3-year, HRT/ERT prospective study. Cemento-enamel junction distances (ACH) were measured on digitized images of bitewing radiographs. Lumbar spine and proximal femur bone mineral densities (BMDs) were determined with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometric scans. Measurements were made at baseline and at the end of year 3. For the 3-year study period, mean change in ACH was determined for each patient. In addition, the sites with the greatest, second and third greatest ACH changes were determined for each patient. Correlations between changes in ACH (as determined by the various methods) and postcranial BMD were determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean ACH changes had an average correlation (r) of -0.24 with femoral and lumbar spine BMDs. Although the largest site-specific change in ACH resulted in a mean correlation of -0.21, the correlations for the second and third largest changes in ACH dropped to -0.15 and -0.12. Overall, the correlations for site-specific changes were substantively smaller than those for generalized change.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe data of this study indicate that ACH change attributable to HRT/ERT is generalized rather than site specific. Studies of the effect of HRT/ERT on ACH should employ multiple measurements to minimize measurement errors associated with site-specific measurements.", "outbound_citations": ["12076241", "10968781", "10968780", "10872947", "28200512", "10476887", "10052767", "10052768", "9846792", "9722695", "9401935", "9446984", "29539796", "8058958", "8144732", "1507045", "1602040", "2231229", "2531791", "3260061"], "inbound_citations": ["37048071", "35525910", "35244945", "32112570", "28225430"], "label": "0"}

Method: Women (n = 159) aged < 65 years experiencing \u2265 20 hot flushes/night sweats per week received either a vaginal ring releasing estradiol acetate at a rate equivalent to 50 \u03bcg/day estradiol plus placebo tablets or oral estradiol 1 mg/day plus a placebo vaginal ring for 24 weeks. For patients with inadequate control of symptoms, the dosage was doubled at 12 weeks. A 24-week, open-label extension of the vaginal ring treatment followed double-blind treatment. Results: The frequency of hot flushes/night sweats was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) in both groups at 12 and 24 weeks from baseline, by 84% and 94% for the vaginal ring group and by 73% and 83% for the oral group, respectively. The mean intensity of urogenital symptoms decreased from screening to the end of treatment in both groups. The incidence of adverse events was similar for both groups. No clinically relevant local effects of the vaginal ring were observed. Conclusions: The vaginal ring relieved both systemic and urogenital symptoms and was well tolerated and accepted. Overall, the efficacy, safety and acceptability of the vaginal ring were comparable with those of oral estradiol therapy.", "outbound_citations": ["11799954", "11439947", "10839558", "10810957", "10993030", "10523222", "10477804", "10538456", "10430010", "9764689", "9031963", "8752255", "8605133", "8572039", "8455670", "8412889", "8456878", "8456877", "28524413", "3185293", "3852361"], "inbound_citations": ["37054722", "36868359", "36727806", "34972504", "33858012", "32684013", "31621155", "30959058", "30889085", "30016672"], "label": "1"}

We compared the effects of tamoxifen at 1 mg/day and 5 mg/day with those of the standard dose of 20 mg/day on breast cancer proliferation using a surrogate endpoint marker (Ki-67 expression) and blood biomarkers associated with breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and bone fracture risk.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 120 women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer to tamoxifen at 1, 5, or 20 mg/day for 4 weeks. Expression of the tumor proliferation marker Ki-67 and of biomarkers of breast cancer (insulin-like growth factor-I, sex hormone-binding globulin), cardiovascular disease (cholesterol, triglycerides, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, antithrombin-III), and bone fracture (type I collagen C-telopeptide) risk were determined before (baseline) and after treatment. All levels were compared with those in two nonrandomized control groups (34 women with ER-negative breast cancer and 29 additional women with ER-positive breast cancer). Data were analyzed by analysis of covariance. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nRESULTS\nExpression of Ki-67 decreased in all three tamoxifen groups, with no difference in the magnitude of reduction among groups (P =.81). Relative to baseline, Ki-67 expression decreased by a median of 15.0% (95% confidence interval = 0.0% to 24.1%) among the tamoxifen groups but increased by 12.8% (95% confidence interval = 0.0% to 19.6%) among the nonrandomized control groups. Several blood biomarkers showed dose-response relationships with tamoxifen, including decreased insulin-like growth factor-I, increased sex hormone-binding globulin, and decreased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and antithrombin-III levels.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe effects on Ki-67 expression of lower doses of tamoxifen were comparable to those achieved with the standard dose, although the effects on blood biomarkers were variable.

In the NEO group, hormone levels fell 3 wk after the initial LHRH-A injection, and deoxypyridinoline increased significantly (P = 0.006). At BL, the EST group had higher bone turnover due to the longer duration of LHRH-A treatment. With E(2) treatment, E(2) levels rose into the normal male range, and two resorption markers decreased significantly from BL by 33% for NTX (P < 0.001) and 28% for CTX (P = 0.009). Bone formation markers did not change. PTH increased by 43% from BL (P < 0.01) in the E(2) group and decreased 16% from BL in the PL group (P < 0.01). Ionized calcium did not change in the E(2) group, but increased in the PL group by 2.3% (P < 0.01). NTX and CTX increased 6 wk after E(2) withdrawal in the EST group.

Methods In a long-term, 2-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 204 postmenopausal women were treated with esterified estrogens 0.3 mg daily or placebo. Menopausal symptoms were assessed with a modified Kupperman index at baseline, 3, 6 and thereafter every 6 months. In a second 12-week, open-label, short-term pilot study, 25 postmenopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms were treated with esterified estrogens 0.3 mg daily for 12 weeks. Vasomotor symptoms and quality of life were assessed using the Greene scale and Quality of Life Menopause Scale (QUALMS). Results In the long-term study, significant (p < 0.05) reductions in total symptom scores were observed at each time point with esterified estrogens compared with placebo. Somatic symptom scores (hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness) decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in patients treated with esterified estrogens 0.3 mg compared to baseline and placebo. In the short-term, open-label pilot study, the incidence of vasomotor symptoms was significantly (p < 0.01) reduced with esterified estrogens 0.3 mg from week 4 until the study end. Significant (p < 0.05) improvements versus baseline were seen in the somatic and vasomotor/sleep domains and in the total quality-of-life score.

This trial examined the effects of a 12-month HRT and high-impact physical exercise regimen on skeletal muscle in women in early menopause. A total of 80 women aged 50-57 years were assigned randomly to one of four groups: exercise (Ex), HRT, exercise+HRT (ExHRT) and control (Co). The exercise groups participated in a high-impact training programme. The administration of HRT (oestradiol/noretisterone acetate) or placebo was carried out double-blind. Knee extension torque and vertical jumping height were evaluated. Lean tissue cross-sectional area (LCSA) and the relative proportion of fat within the muscle compartment were measured for the quadriceps and lower leg muscles. The ExHRT group showed significant increases in knee extension torque (8.3%) and vertical jumping height (17.2%) when compared with the Co group (-7.2%). Vertical jumping height also increased after HRT alone (6.8%). The LCSA of the quadriceps was increased significantly in the HRT (6.3%) and ExHRT (7.1%) groups when compared with the Ex (2.2%) and Co (0.7%) groups. Lower leg LCSA was also increased in the ExHRT group (9.1%) when compared with the Ex (3.0%) and Co (4.1%) groups.

In contrast, concurrent progestin therapy may oppose this beneficial effect. We studied the effect of long-term estrogen HRT and combined HRT on vasomotor function and on plasma nitrate, which reflects the amount of NO in the circulation. As lipid peroxidation affects NO production and impairs endothelial function, we also measured the amount of the in vivo lipid peroxidation marker urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha). The study group comprised 15 women receiving estradiol valerate HRT (mean age, 56 yr; treatment duration, 10.5 yr) and 15 women receiving combined HRT with estradiol valerate and levonorgestrel (mean age, 58 yr; treatment duration, 11.3 yr). The peak flow velocity (PFV) and pulsatility index of the common carotid and internal carotid artery and the abdominal aorta were measured by ultrasonography after long-term HRT (baseline), after a 4-wk pause and again 3 wk after reintroducing HRT. A statistically significant interaction between the groups and time points was observed in the PFV of the internal carotid artery (P = 0.011). In women taking estradiol valerate, the PFV values decreased significantly after withdrawal of HRT (P = 0.007) and increased again to the baseline level after reintroduction of therapy (P < 0.001). In women receiving combined HRT, the PFV remained stable over all study periods. At baseline, the PFV of women taking estradiol valerate correlated with the plasma nitrate concentration in the common carotid artery (r = 0.646; P = 0.009) and in the abdominal aorta (r = 0.579; P = 0.024). For pulsatility index and urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha) excretion, there were no significant differences between the groups. Our results suggest that the favorable effects of long-term estrogen treatment on blood flow are at least partly mediated through NO.

Fifty-eight early postmenopausal women attending metabolic bone disease outpatient clinics were randomly allocated into four treatment groups and monitored for up to 4 years. All patients received 1.0 g/d of elemental calcium. In addition, group 1 received percutaneously administered HRT (n = 15); group 2, intermittent cyclical etidronate (ICE) (n = 14); group 3, HRT and ICE (n = 15); and group 4, calcium alone (n = 14). The bone mineral density (measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), biochemical variables of bone turnover, including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and urinary hydroxyproline:creatinine ratios were measured before treatment and at 2 and 4 years after treatment. In patients who received the combined therapy, bone mineral density was increased in the vertebrae by 10.9% (P < 0.001) and in the femora by 7.25% (P < 0.001) at 4 years. For patients treated with ICE, the increase was 6.79% (P < 0.001) and 1.20% (P < 0.05), and with HRT, 6.78% (P < 0.001) and 4.01% (P < 0.01) in the vertebrae and femora, respectively.

Healthy postmenopausal women (n = 15) consumed diets with similar calcium content (approximately 600 mg), but either low or high in meat (12 vs. 20% of energy as protein) for 8 wk each, in a randomized crossover design. After 4 wk of equilibration of each diet, calcium retention was measured by extrinsically labeling the 2-d menu with (47)Ca, followed by whole body scintillation counting for 28 d. Urinary and blood indicators of bone metabolism were also determined for each diet. Calcium retention was not different during the high and low meat dietary periods (d 28, mean +/- pooled SD: 17.1 and 15.6%, +/-0.6%, respectively; P = 0.09). An initially higher renal acid excretion in subjects consuming the high meat compared with the low meat diet decreased significantly with time.

Several transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) releasing estrogens, progestogens and androgens from patches attached to the skin are currently in clinical use. For women, transdermal systems have been developed for hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) and recently for contraception. HRT with patches releasing only estradiol (E2) should be supplemented with a progestogen to protect the endometrium. Patches simultaneously releasing both E2 and a progestogen are also available. Combined regimens are either continuous or sequential. In the latter, estrogen-only patches are applied for 14 days, followed by 14-day application of patches releasing both hormones. Transdermal HRT successfully treats menopausal symptoms and has a bone-sparing effect. Transdermal contraceptive patches deliver ethinyl E2 in combination with the progestogen norelgestromin. This system provides an effective contraceptive and acceptable bleeding pattern not different from that of oral contraceptives. The types of adverse events experienced are approximately the same as with oral contraceptives. Reactions at the application site cause about 3% women to discontinue the use of patches. Transdermal systems also have been designed to supplement testosterone in hypogonadal men. Testosterone released from patches produces positive effects on mood and sexual behavior and significantly increases bone mass. Men using testosterone patches have to be regularly monitored for an increase in prostate volume and changes in prostate-specific antigen. Reproductive steroids delivered by the skin avoid first-pass liver metabolism, typical of oral dosing; consequently, the liver tissue is affected to a lesser degree. Other advantages include rapid onset and termination of action, noninvasive self-administration and attainment of therapeutic hormone levels with low daily doses. Reduced frequency of dosing has the potential to improve patient compliance. While compliance is important for any hormone, it is particularly important for contraceptive purposes. Like oral delivery of sex steroids, percutaneous absorption is characterized by intra- and interindividual variability. New technologies under development, combining electronics and low-frequency ultrasound, have the potential to provide precise dosing as well as drug delivery \"on demand.\"", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35854200", "34924261", "34564827", "34342862", "33451805", "33434082", "33017199", "32811339", "32442677", "31242625"], "label": "0"}

These procedures were performed at baseline and at annual intervals for 3 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCorrelations between cross-sectional measurements of clinical attachment level and bone mineral density were very weak, and did not approach statistical significance (-0.06 < or =r < or =0.10, 0.15 < or =P < or =0.75). A few somewhat stronger correlations were found between longitudinal changes in bone mineral density and attachment (-0.20 < or = r < or =-0.02, 0.02 < or = P < or =0.81). Although the correlations in the longitudinal changes were weak, they were consistently in the direction of greater bone mineral density being associated with less attachment loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is no clear association between clinical attachment level and bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and proximal femur, whether examined on a cross-sectional or longitudinal basis. Patterns in the data suggest there may be a weak association in the longitudinal changes.", "outbound_citations": ["10505800", "9401935", "29539796", "8058958", "2231229", "18839484"], "inbound_citations": ["35244945", "35010513", "35919753", "32716051", "32246534", "30739380", "31701920", "30633332", "31403113", "29863237", "29307975", "29033921", "28812320", "28320084", "28048966"], "label": "0"}

History of premenstrual syndrome, type of progestin, and dose of progestin have thus far been shown to influence the progestin-induced adverse mood symptoms during HRT. The aim of this study was to compare adverse mood effects of two different doses of estradiol, in combination with a progestin, during postmenopausal HRT. Twenty-eight perimenopausal women were included in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing 2- or 3-mg continuous estradiol, with an addition of 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate on d 17-28 during each treatment cycle. The main outcome measures were mood and physical symptoms kept on a daily rating scale. Together with the progestin, the higher dose of estrogen caused significantly more negative mood symptoms than the lower dose. Tension, irritability, and depressed mood were all significantly augmented during the progestin phase of cycles with 3 mg estradiol (P < 0.001). Physical symptoms also increased during the progestin phase of 3-mg estradiol cycles (P < 0.001), whereas positive mood symptoms were less affected. The only positive mood that changed with estrogen dose was friendliness, which decreased during the progestin phase of high estradiol cycles compared with cycles with lower estradiol (P < 0.05). Our conclusion is that an increase of the estrogen dose accentuates negative mood and physical symptoms during the progestin phase of sequential hormonal therapy.", "outbound_citations": ["11834317", "11915576", "11772707", "11474221", "11287028", "11281470", "11588948", "11599309", "11120505", "11030291", "11006499", "10942479", "10792584", "10577620", "10465375", "10451814", "9659856", "9626129", "9618754", "9373888", "9203229", "9286739", "8752255", "7966923", "8055122", "8164947", "8456888", "1888688", "1828550", "1846872", "2725334", "3801360", "4061059", "13423008"], "inbound_citations": ["37108027", "36767083", "36447434", "34506047", "33909242", "28221088"], "label": "0"}

Healthy, community-dwelling women (N = 167) who were older than 65 years at enrollment.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nDosage of 0.25 mg/d of micronized 17beta-estradiol (n = 83) or placebo (n = 84); all women who had not had a hysterectomy received 100 mg/d of oral micronized progesterone for 2-week periods every 6 months.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe BMD of the hip, spine, wrist, and total body measured annually for 3 years. Serum and urine biochemical markers of bone resorption and formation and sex hormones were measured at baseline, 3 months, and during years 1 and 3 of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean BMD increased at all sites for participants taking low-dose estrogen (17beta-estradiol) compared with placebo (P<.001). Compared with participants receiving placebo, participants taking low-dose estrogen had BMD increases of 2.6% for the femoral neck; 3.6%, total hip; 2.8%, spine; and 1.2%, total body. Markers of bone turnover, N-telopeptides of type 1 collagen, and bone alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly (P<.001) in participants taking low-dose estrogen compared with placebo. Estradiol, estrone, and sex hormone-binding globulin levels increased in the estrogen-treated group compared with placebo. The adverse effect profile was similar; specifically, there were no statistically significant differences in breast tenderness, changes in endometrial thickness or pathological effects, or annual mammographic results between the 2 groups. The number of abnormal mammograms over 3 years was 15 for the low-dose estrogen group and 10 for the placebo group (8 occurred at baseline) (P =.26). There were no reports of breast cancer during the study.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn older women, a dosage of 0.25 mg/d of 17beta-estradiol increased bone density of the hip, spine, and total body, and reduced bone turnover, with minimal adverse effects.

Although syndrome X does not result in an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, the symptoms are often troublesome and unresponsive to conventional antianginal therapy. The majority of patients are postmenopausal, and estrogen therapy can alleviate anginal symptoms. We investigated the effect of esterified estrogens combined with methyltestosterone (Estratest) on quality of life in postmenopausal women with syndrome X. DesignPatients were withdrawn from antianginal therapy. Sublingual nitrates were allowed for treatment of anginal episodes. Patients underwent treadmill testing, and quality of life was assessed by using the Short Form-36 and Cardiac Health Profile questionnaires after the women had received 8 weeks of Estratest or identical placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. ResultsNineteen patients were randomized, and 16 patients completed the protocol. Plasma 17&bgr;-estradiol concentrations were significantly increased by Estratest; however, total testosterone levels were not. The \u201cemotional\u201d score of the Cardiac Health Profile questionnaire was significantly improved after Estratest use compared with placebo (p = 0.03); however, there was no significant change in the Short Form-36 questionnaire for any variable. Estratest significantly increased systolic blood pressure and rate pressure product at rest but had no effect on exercise parameters. Time to onset of chest pain during exercise was also unaffected. ConclusionsWe have demonstrated a beneficial effect of Estratest on emotional well-being in postmenopausal women with cardiological syndrome X.

Climacteric symptoms were assessed at the same intervals as well as 8 weeks after the end of therapy. All women had low pretreatment levels of estradiol and high FSH concentrations. During estradiol therapy estradiol levels increased significantly, whereas FSH only decreased slightly. No woman developed vasomotor symptoms after withdrawal of therapy. Postmenopausal women without previous or current vasomotor symptoms did not develop such symptoms when estrogen replacement therapy was first instituted and then abruptly stopped.

Review of patients treated in our osteoporosis clinic identified 150 postmenopausal women with low BMD treated with 30 mg of risedronate once weekly, between February 1998 and March 2001. Baseline GI symptoms or previous intolerance of bisphosphonates was present in 32 patients. An additional antiresorptive treatment was continued with risedronate in 50% of these patients (estrogen, raloxifene, or calcitonin). Risedronate 30 mg was taken once weekly with vitamin D 400 iu daily and 1200 mg of calcium daily. Patient age ranged from 46 to 86 yr. Baseline and followup BMD data were available in 36 patients. Of the 32 patients with baseline GI symptoms or previous intolerance of a bisphosphonate, 1 developed GI symptoms. In those patients with baseline and follow-up BMD results (n = 36), BMD increased 1.9% (p = 0.02) at the trochanter and 2.1% (p = 0.001) at the total hip. In conclusion 30 mg of risedronate once weekly increased BMD at the trochanter and total hip (p < 0.05). This dosage was well tolerated with a low incidence of GI side effects.", "outbound_citations": ["9753265", "11172164", "11192135", "10999794", "10982755", "10843171", "10709154", "10746426", "10688387", "10527181", "10487668", "9467547"], "inbound_citations": [], "label": "0"}

Evidence is abundant that hormonal replacement therapy prevents the bone loss that follows natural or surgical menopause and reduces the prevalence of osteoporotic fractures in later life [1-4]. However, only about 10% of American women elect to receive replacement therapy because of attitudes of physicians and patients, the undesirability of menstrual bleeding, and unresolved questions about the relation of the use of estrogen to breast cancer [5]. Moreover, the duration of hormonal therapy may need to be prolonged because bone loss recurs when therapy is discontinued, yet the incidence of some adverse effects increases with the duration of estrogen use. Safer alternatives to estrogen use have been sought. Epidemiologic and cross-sectional studies have suggested that increasing calcium intake might prevent postmenopausal bone loss, and prospective studies have yielded conflicting results [6-17]. Moreover, some investigators have suggested that effects differ on the various skeletal sites used to determine the rate of bone loss [18]. We compared the efficacy of calcium augmentation in early postmenopause with calcium augmentation plus hormonal replacement therapy and with placebo. The study had a three-arm, randomized, parallel design. The patients receiving hormonal replacement therapy were obviously not blinded nor were their physicians, whereas the placebo and calcium groups were double blinded. Methods Healthy, white women between 6 months and 6 years after a natural menopause were recruited to participate in the study. The protocol was approved by the Human Investigation Review Committees of Winthrop-University Hospital and Brookhaven National Laboratory; written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Participants were recruited by announcements in the local press and in hospital and university publications and through a direct mail campaign. All participants had a history and physical examination. Exclusion characteristics included any disorder known to affect bone metabolism such as glucocorticoid use, gastrointestinal disease, or any chronic illness. Previous or current malignancy was an exclusion characteristic as were absolute contraindications to estrogen replacement or calcium supplements. Absolute contraindications to estrogen replacement therapy included estrogen-dependent neoplasm (breast or uterus), undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, thrombophlebitis or thromboembolism, and acute liver disease. Women with the following problems considered by some investigators to be relative contraindications to estrogen therapy were also excluded: gallbladder disease, history of liver disease, first-degree relatives with breast cancer, and hypertension. Calcium urolithiasis was also an exclusion factor. Women with known osteoporosis or with a vertebral compression fracture were not eligible for the study. One hundred eighteen women entered the study. The women were randomly assigned to three groups: 1) hormonal replacement [estrogen-progesterone-calcium carbonate], 2) calcium carbonate, or 3) placebo. Assignment to the groups was based on computer-generated random numbers provided by the statistician, with stratification for years postmenopause. The women in the hormonal replacement group took conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Inc.; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), 0.625 mg daily for 25 days of the month along with medroxyprogesterone (Provera, Upjohn; Kalamazoo, Michigan), 10 mg from days 16 to 25. All women received 400 IU of vitamin D daily in the form of a multivitamin, and calcium supplementation (as Caltrate, Lederle; Clifton, New Jersey) was provided to the two treatment groups. The duration of the study was 2.9 1.1 years (mean SD). A 7-day dietary history was reviewed with a nutritionist every 2 months; calcium was provided as calcium carbonate, 600 mg (Caltrate), and used to supplement the diet to approximate a total daily intake of 1700 mg of elemental calcium (the mean + 2 SD found by Heaney and colleagues [7] to result in zero calcium balance in estrogen-deprived women). The calcium supplements were taken with meals in divided doses. The placebo appeared identical to the calcium carbonate tablets. No patients took antacids or histamine-2 blockers. All women had a baseline mammogram. Measurements Routine laboratory studies included a complete blood count, urinalysis, and serum fasting calcium, phosphorus, urea nitrogen, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, and aminotransferase measurements [19, 20]. In addition, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, free thyroxine, and bone alkaline phosphatase were measured, and a urine specimen was collected after an overnight fast for hydroxyproline, calcium, and creatinine determinations, following a 3-day low-hydroxyproline diet [21-23]. Total body calcium was measured annually in the participants, using the delayed neutron activation method at Brookhaven National Laboratory [24, 25]. This method uses a whole-body counter to measure the characteristic rays emitted from the neutron capture of Calcium-48 (natural abundance of 0.187%) in the body. The Brookhaven National Laboratory whole-body counter was upgraded in 1987 to use 32 NaI (T1) detectors of 10 cm 10 cm 46 cm positioned symmetrically above and below the patient [25]. The activated isotope, Calcium-49, decays with a half-life of 8.72 minutes, emitting a 3.08 MeV characteristic line. More than 99.5% of the body calcium is contained in the bone [26]. The method provides total body calcium with a coefficient of variation of about 1.5% when no substantial change in the body weight occurs during the period of repeated studies. The measurements were made annually. The bone mineral density of the distal radius site was measured using a Lunar Radiation (Madison, Wisconsin) single-photon absorptiometer (SP2). Bone mineral density of the spine (L2-L4) and femur (neck, trochanter, and Ward triangle) was measured using a Lunar Radiation DP4 dual-photon absorptiometer. The software version used for the analysis of scans was DP4 Lunar Corporation Version 1.1. All scans were analyzed using the same software version, which corrects for source decay. Instruments were calibrated daily, and the radioactive source was changed annually. Each measurement was done every 6 months. The coefficient of variation of these measurements was 2%, except for the Ward triangle (2.5%). Activity was measured using activity monitors (large-scale integrated monitors), which were worn about the waist [27]. The average of 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day was used as an activity score. Activity was measured at baseline and at one other point during the study to ensure that differences among the groups were not due to varied levels of exercise. Statistical Analysis Total body calcium was selected as the primary criterion for efficacy for the following reasons: It measures mass rather than density per unit area; it measures calcium balance precisely and accurately in the free living state and may be better related to previous studies using the balance technique; it is more precise than the other measurements; and it avoids sampling error by measuring the entire skeleton rather than a specific region of the appendicular or axial skeleton. The rate of change in bone mineral was calculated for each woman at each of the sites used in the study. Standard linear regression procedures were used to estimate the rate of bone mineral change for each woman, and the regression intercept was used as the best estimate of the baseline value. Because some women terminated their participation in the study before others, the rate-of-change data were weighted by the inverse variance to reflect the fit of the regression line for each woman [28]. Analyses of covariance were done using body mass index, activity scores, cigarette smoking, calcium intake, age, and years postmenopause as covariates. The data reported in this article are based on all women who provided at least three observations for a particular skeletal site. We considered other criteria, such as using data only from women who had participated in the study for at least 2 years, and all data analyses were done for this subgroup as well. The results of these analyses were invariably similar to those reported here and therefore are not presented separately. The mean rates of change in bone mineral for each condition at each site were characterized in terms of both raw units and percentages; separate analyses were carried out for each. The two indices were similar. Evidence from recent research is substantial that estrogen replacement therapy is effective, whereas the efficacy of calcium supplements is questionable. Our expectation was that our data would confirm the efficacy of estrogen-progesterone-calcium therapy, and the critical question was whether or not a beneficial effect of calcium supplements given alone could be shown. A separate one-way analysis of covariance was done for each of the bone mineral measurements to compare the mean rates of change in bone mineral for each of the three conditions. We used two a priori contrasts: the first contrasting women taking estrogen with those receiving calcium and the second comparing women receiving calcium supplements with those on placebo. All P values reported are two-tailed. Results Baseline data for historical data and bone mineral measurements and chemical studies are given in Table 1. Analysis of variance showed no significant differences in the baseline variables. The initial and final activity scores did not differ significantly. Table 1.

Both the double-blind and the open-label phase lasted 2 months. ERPs were recorded from 19 EEG leads in a two-tone odd-ball paradigm in 49 patients aged between 46 and 67 yr with the diagnosis of insomnia (G 47.0) related to postmenopausal syndrome (N 95.1). Climodien reduced standard N1 and target P300 latencies as compared to placebo, while EV did not affect N1 latency but similarly reduced P300 latency. Climodien increased N1, P2 and P300 amplitudes dose-dependently, predominantly at frontal leads. Estrogen alone had only minor effects on ERP amplitudes. The shortening of standard N1 latency and enhancement of N1 and P2 amplitudes indicates a positive effect of Climodien on perceptual processing, most likely due to vigilance improvements also observed in EEG mapping. Concerning target P300, it seems that estradiol is responsible for the improvement in stimulus evaluation time, as reflected by the shortening of the peak latency, while dienogest seems to account for the improvement in cognitive information processing capacity, whereby 3 mg induced a more pronounced augmentation of P300 amplitudes than 2 mg. Based on the spatial distribution of this increase, it can be speculated that Climodien mainly affects the more frontally distributed P3a subcomponent, which is associated with attention and orientation. Furthermore, the observed changes in ERP-components are consistent with recent studies showing significant positive effects of hormone replacement therapy on cholinergic functions. Thus, Climodien seems to be of interest in preventing cognitive decline and treating cognitive disorders in postmenopausal women. Indeed, there is increasing evidence of beneficial effects of estrogen in dementia. Our present findings suggest that the estrogen effects may be augmented by dienogest.", "outbound_citations": ["8657828", "7604138", "12941063", "12443834", "11516803", "11403979", "11474221", "11337133", "11472860", "11255426", "11281470", "11304940", "11297335", "11156805", "11158031", "11164275", "11104644", "11379382", "11379383", "11063980", "11006501", "11085689", "10894312", "10936742", "10851365", "10847257", "10920401", "10810963", "10791869", "10915920", "10805607", "10725383", "10809945", "10731841", "10680789", "10680553", "10686371", "11910651", "10965505", "10965513", "10965504", "10522948", "10522949", "10451908", "10667301", "10399774", "10474063", "10418692", "10379829", "10371654", "10101041", "10072666", "10227002", "10098219", "10475089", "10695961", "9951614", "9799621", "9799622", "9799627", "9880046", "9802129", "9654384", "9571651", "9610125", "9496988", "9566629", "9456341", "9741777", "9484355", "9502510", "9438269", "9409335", "9393381", "9373888", "9344404", "9344402", "9395716", "9259172", "9236480", "9205834", "9191758", "9186239", "9153163", "9153164", "9203229", "9083643", "9160217", "9286739", "9258894", "9049084", "9020805", "8909345", "8885820", "9044441", "8753933", "8844880", "8861091", "8541226", "8637608", "8534788", "8542304", "7593479", "7491367", "7649046", "7802412", "7802416", "8080389", "7519140", "8030628", "8190445", "7913237", "8120125", "8210412", "8352327", "8314095", "1466818", "1513930", "1467811", "1488471", "1316615", "1317178", "1388702", "2068431", "1781975", "1915025", "1694481", "1694485", "2132641", "1691970", "2317307", "2925834", "2756255", "2716439", "2716438", "3183305", "3615753", "3596949", "3808322", "2428593", "3823345", "6497352", "6739673", "737523", "76553", "331844", "46819"], "inbound_citations": ["34613511", "32911233", "30130548", "29703014"], "label": "0"}

Raloxifene competes with endogenous estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in breast tissue. A woman's estradiol level may alter the effects of raloxifene on breast cancer and other outcomes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo test the hypothesis that raloxifene reduces breast cancer risk more in women with relatively high estradiol levels than in women with very low estradiol levels.\n\n\nDESIGN\nAnalysis of the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1994 to 1999.\n\n\nSETTING\nOne hundred eighty community settings and medical practices in 25 countries including the United States.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 7290 postmenopausal women aged 80 years or younger with osteoporosis who had baseline serum estradiol concentrations measured by a central laboratory using a sensitive assay. Women with a history of breast cancer or estrogen use were excluded.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nParticipants were randomly assigned to receive 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d of raloxifene (n = 4843) or matching placebo (n = 2447) for 4 years.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nNew cases of histopathologically confirmed breast cancer in the treatment and placebo groups, stratified by estradiol levels.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the placebo group, women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L (2.7 pg/mL) had a 6.8-fold higher rate of breast cancer (3.0% per 4 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8%-4.1%) than that of women with undetectable estradiol levels (0.6% per 4 years; 95% CI, 0%-1.1%; P =.005 for trend). Women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L in the raloxifene group had a rate of breast cancer that was 76% (95% CI, 53%-88%) lower than that of women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L in the placebo group (absolute rate reduction, 2.2% [95% CI, 1.0%-3.5%; number needed to treat = 45]). In contrast, women with undetectable estradiol levels had similar breast cancer risk whether or not they were treated with raloxifene (risk difference, -0.1%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 0.6%; P =.02 for the interaction). In this cohort, treating women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L with raloxifene for 4 years would have avoided 47% of breast cancer cases.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMeasurement of estradiol level by sensitive assay in postmenopausal women identifies those at high risk of breast cancer who may benefit most from raloxifene. If confirmed, this suggests that measuring estradiol and treating women with high estradiol levels could substantially reduce the rate of breast cancer among postmenopausal women.", "outbound_citations": ["11261828", "11408508", "10561236", "10068384", "9747868", "9731736", "9605801", "9391160", "9338790", "9032046", "8827358", "8547832", "7707406", "2593165"], "inbound_citations": ["37246822", "37232902", "36951827", "36374501", "35774616", "32674135", "32077686", "31292269", "30753842", "30760815", "29526689", "28791495", "28212313"], "label": "0"}

Estrogen replacement therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes, but its use is controversial in breast cancer survivors. Progestins may offer a good alternative for the control of hot flashes in this setting; in particular, oral megestrol acetate has been proven effective in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. With the aim of further improving these results, we have designed a randomized study comparing oral megestrol acetate with depot intramuscular (i.m.) medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for the control of hot flashes in postmenopausal patients with a history of breast cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nSeventy-one postmenopausal patients were randomized to receive an i.m. injection of depot MPA 500 mg on days 1, 14 and 28, or oral megestrol acetate 40 mg daily for 6 weeks. Patients recorded daily the number and severity of their hot flashes; response was defined as a > or =50% decrease in the number and severity of hot flashes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt week 6, hot flashes were reduced by 86% on average in the whole group of patients, without significant differences between the two progestins. Response was obtained by 75 and 67% of patients receiving MPA or megestrol, respectively (P = 0.5). Responders were followed to assess maintenance of response (without further treatment), which was significantly better with i.m. MPA: in this group, 89% of responders still showed a benefit at week 24, compared with 45% in the megestrol group (P = 0.03).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study shows that a short cycle of i.m. depot MPA injections provides significant and long-lasting relief from postmenopausal hot flashes in patients with a history of breast cancer, offering an alternative to estrogen replacement therapy or prolonged administration of oral megestrol.", "outbound_citations": ["11145492", "10694559", "10690382", "9576302", "9576289", "9469333", "9469334", "8725700", "7595732", "8028614", "8270972", "6775094", "7416212", "1153148"], "inbound_citations": ["33891888", "32199930", "30523459", "30188738", "27901302", "28822332"], "label": "0"}

New low-dose estrogen-progestin regimens alleviate postmenopausal symptoms with a favorable side-effect profile; however, little is known of the impact of such regimens in women at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Hence, we have evaluated the effects of low-dose oral estrogen-progestin therapy on serum lipoprotein lipids, brachial artery reactivity and fibrinogen in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women in direct comparison with the effects of pravastatin, a lipid-lowering agent known to reduce cardiovascular events in women. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel trial, we studied the effects of continuous combined estrogen-progestin therapy (1 mg 17\u03b2-estradiol with 500 \u03bcg norethisterone acetate daily) or pravastatin (20 mg daily) in 72 postmenopausal women with fasting serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels greater than 124 mg/dl after an 8-week run-in diet, over a 24-week period. The primary end-point was percentage change in LDL cholesterol from baseline. Results: The intention-to-treat population comprised 65 women, mean age 59 \u00b1 6.3 years, and 29 in each group completed the trial. Diet alone reduced LDL cholesterol significantly in both treatment groups, in association with a reduction in weight during this period. Compared with respective baseline values, pravastatin decreased LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol to a greater extent than hormone therapy (p = 0.0001 and 0.003 for difference between treatments, respectively). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels decreased with hormone therapy, but did not change with pravastatin (p = 0.01). Lipoprotein(a) decreased significantly with hormone therapy only (-14%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21 to -6%, p = 0.01 for difference between groups). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was impaired at baseline, and this increased with hormone therapy (absolute mean change in artery diameter as percentage units 2.07, 95% CI 0.57-3.57, p = 0.009) versus no change with pravastatin (0.19, 95% CI -1.1 to 1.5, p = 0.78), with a near-significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.058). A significant correlation between improved brachial artery FMD and reduction in LDL cholesterol was not observed. Fibrinogen decreased significantly in both treatment groups with no difference between treatments. Conclusions: In postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women, pravastatin and hormone therapy exhibited divergent effects. The former lowered total and LDL cholesterol more effectively, whereas hormone therapy lowered lipoprotein(a) significantly and improved brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilatation, independent of the reduction in LDL cholesterol. The modest increase in brachial artery FMD seen is consistent with hypercholesterolemia compromising endothelial integrity, and suggests that the important effect of estrogen on the endothelial microenvironment may be attenuated in women with endothelial dysfunction.", "outbound_citations": ["15531279", "11119394", "11036119", "10770146", "10740160", "10385495", "9918521", "9841303", "9718051", "9531230", "9271481", "9041098", "9183229", "9180101", "8855853", "8672166", "7594037", "7788916", "7598139", "7978718", "7968073", "8184850", "1359209", "1435290", "10109801", "2713295", "3604900", "4337382"], "inbound_citations": ["36693423", "29885342"], "label": "0"}

Sixty-nine menopausal women, aged 45-60 years without previous hormonal replacement therapy, diagnosed as major depression without psychotic or suicidal symptoms (DSM-III-R criteria), were randomly assigned to a 3-month treatment with transdermal oestradiol [Estraderm TTS (ETTS) 50 micrograms, applied twice weekly] or placebo. No other psychoactive medication was allowed. After removal of protocol violators, 32 patients were evaluable in each group, which did not differ in age, height or weight. As five patients discontinued prematurely in both groups and in one placebo patient a post-drug EEG could not be obtained, 27 patients remained in the ETTS and 26 in the placebo group for efficacy analysis. While in the placebo group, oestradiol (E2) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) remained unchanged, E2 increased and FSH decreased significantly in the ETTS group. Syndromal evaluation showed a significant improvement in the Kupperman Index (KI) as well as Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) in both groups, with no inter-group difference. However, EEG mapping demonstrated significant inter-drug differences in brain function, mostly over the left temporal region. While ETTS patients showed an increase of alpha and alpha-adjacent theta activity and a decrease of beta activity, as well as an acceleration of the delta/theta centroid and a slowing of the alpha, beta and total power centroid, no changes occurred in the placebo-treated patients. These neurophysiological findings suggest improvement of vigilance by oestrogen, previously referred to as \"mental tonic\" effect. There were no changes, however, in the frontal alpha asymmetry index, reflecting left frontal hypo- and right frontal hyperactivation. Thus, this neurophysiological variable represents a state-independent marker for depression.

All of these attributes, however, are associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods and Results\u2014We evaluated interrelationships between CRP, the metabolic syndrome, and incident cardiovascular events among 14 719 apparently healthy women who were followed up for an 8-year period for myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death; 24% of the cohort had the metabolic syndrome at study entry. At baseline, median CRP levels for those with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 characteristics of the metabolic syndrome were 0.68, 1.09, 1.93, 3.01, 3.88, and 5.75 mg/L, respectively (Ptrend <0.0001). Over the 8-year follow-up, cardiovascular event-free survival rates based on CRP levels above or below 3.0 mg/L were similar to survival rates based on having 3 or more characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. At all levels of severity of the metabolic syndrome, however, CRP added prognostic information on subsequent risk. For example, among those with the metabolic syndrome at study entry, age-adjusted incidence rates of future cardiovascular events were 3.4 and 5.9 per 1000 person-years of exposure for those with baseline CRP levels less than or greater than 3.0 mg/L, respectively.

All women were supplemented with 1 g of calcium per day, and compared with women treated with 1 g of calcium per day alone (control group, n=15). There were no significant differences in age, body mass index (BMI), hormone values, bone metabolism markers and femur BMD in the treatment and control groups before the study. In calcium-treated women serum plasma osteocalcin (BGP) and hydroxyproline/creatinine urinary excretion (OHP/Cr) remained stable during all the observation period. In this group, femoral neck, Ward's triangle and trochanter BMD showed a progressive and significant (P<0.05) decrease. In the LD-HRT group, a significant (P<0.05) decrease in serum BGP and OHP/Cr was observed. In these women, the values of these markers of bone turnover at 36 months were significantly (P<0.01) different from those of calcium-treated women. During the LD-HRT administration, all BMD measures did not show any significant modifications. In these women, treated with LD-HRT the BMD values were significantly (P<0.05) different from those measured in calcium-treated women in all the femur sites of measurements. In the control group, BMI significantly (P<0.05) increased from baseline value with a weight gain of 3%, while in the LD-HRT group, BMI did not change after 36 months of treatment and the 1.3% gain in body weight was not significant. LD-HRT was effective in reducing menopausal clinical symptoms and provided a favorable bleeding profile, and minimal side effects. LD-HRT was effective in reducing menopausal clinical symptoms and minimal and transient side effects were reported.
