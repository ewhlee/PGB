Therefore, 108 freshly extracted molars were embedded in acrylic resin, perpendicular to their long axis, and prepared for full crowns: the crown preparations were removed and reconstructed using composite resin plus fiber posts with dimensions identical to the prepared dentin. The preparations were impressed using addition silicone, and Y-TZP copings were produced, which presented a special setup for the tensile testing. Cementation was performed with two adhesive resin cements (Multilink Automix, Ivoclar-Vivadent; RelyX ARC, 3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA), one self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX U100, 3M ESPE), one glass ionomer based cement (RelyX Luting, 3M ESPE), and one zinc phosphate cement (Cimento de Zinco, SS White, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). For the resin cement groups, the inner surfaces of the crowns were subjected to three surface treatments: cleaning with isopropyl alcohol, tribochemical silica coating, or application of a thin low-fusing glass porcelain layer plus silanization. After 24 hours, all groups were subjected to thermocycling (6000 cycles) and included in a special device for tensile testing in a universal testing machine to test the retention of the infrastructure. After testing, the failure modes of all samples were analyzed under a stereomicroscope. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the surface treatment and cement type (\u03b1=0.05) affected the tensile retention results. The Multilink cement presented the highest tensile retention values, but that result was not statistically different from RelyX ARC. The surface treatment was statistically relevant only for the Multilink cement. The cement choice was shown to be more important than the crown surface treatment for cementation of a Y-TZP crown to a composite resin substrate.", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Rippe", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Amaral", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Oliveira", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Cesar", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Scotti", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Valandro", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Bottino", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2015", "venue": "Operative dentistry", "journal": "Operative dentistry", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article"], "chemicals": ["Glass Ionomer Cements", "Ivoclar Universal Cement", "Phosphates", "Polymethacrylic Acids", "RelyX ARC", "Resin Cements", "Resins, Synthetic", "Zinc Compounds", "multilink adhesive system", "yttria stabilized tetragonal zirconia", "zinc phosphate", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate", "Yttrium", "Zirconium"], "mesh": [{"term": "Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Crowns", "is_major": true, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Etching", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Restoration Failure", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Stress Analysis", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Glass Ionomer Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Phosphates", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Polyethylene Glycols", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Polymethacrylic Acids", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Resin Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Resins, Synthetic", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Tensile Strength", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Yttrium", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Zinc Compounds", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Zirconium", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

The aim of this study was to determine whether the stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha)/CXCR4 axis is involved in the interaction of EOC cells with HPMCs in peritoneal metastasis. Clinically, we first evaluated CXCR4 expression in sections from 36 primary EOCs using immunohistochemistry. We next examined whether SDF-1alpha played roles in EOC progression, including in proliferation, cell motility, attachment to HPMCs, and the in vivo development of peritoneal metastasis through CXCR4. Of the 36 carcinomas, 16 cases (44.4%) were positive for CXCR4 immunoexpression. Positive CXCR4 expression significantly predicted poorer overall survival compared with negative expression (p = 0.0069). We found CXCR4 expression in both EOC cells and HPMCs. In contrast, the level of production of SDF-1alpha by HPMCs was higher than that by various EOC cells. Functionally, SDF-1alpha induced enhanced attachment between ES-2 cells and HPMCs or extracellular matrix components. The enhancement of adhesion potential by SDF-1alpha was inhibited by AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, and by phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and p44/42 inhibitors. Furthermore, intraperitoneal treatment with AMD3100 resulted in reduced dissemination in nude mice inoculated with ES-2 cells. The present results suggest that there may be a link between the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 axis and enhanced intraperitoneal dissemination of EOC and that CXCR4 may be a novel target for the treatment of EOC.", "authors": [{"first": "Hiroaki", "middle": [], "last": "Kajiyama", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Kiyosumi", "middle": [], "last": "Shibata", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Mikio", "middle": [], "last": "Terauchi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Kazuhiko", "middle": [], "last": "Ino", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Akihiro", "middle": [], "last": "Nawa", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Fumitaka", "middle": [], "last": "Kikkawa", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2008", "venue": "International journal of cancer", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article"], "chemicals": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "Benzylamines", "CXCL12 protein, human", "Chemokine CXCL12", "Cyclams", "Heterocyclic Compounds", "Receptors, CXCR4", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "plerixafor"], "mesh": [{"term": "Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Adult", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Aged", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Animals", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Anti-HIV Agents", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Benzylamines", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Blotting, Western", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Carcinoma, Endometrioid", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Cell Adhesion", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Cell Movement", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Chemokine CXCL12", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Coculture Techniques", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Cyclams", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Female", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Flow Cytometry", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Heterocyclic Compounds", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Immunoenzyme Techniques", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Mice", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Ovarian Neoplasms", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Peritoneal Neoplasms", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Peritoneum", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Phosphorylation", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Receptors, CXCR4", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Signal Transduction", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

{"pmid": "16563433", "label": 0, "title": "Filling small, empty protein cavities: structural and energetic consequences.", "abstract": "Most proteins contain small cavities that can be filled by replacing cavity-lining residues by larger ones. Since shortening mutations in hydrophobic cores tend to destabilize proteins, it is expected that cavity-filling mutations may conversely increase protein stability. We have filled three small cavities in apoflavodoxin and determined by NMR and equilibrium unfolding analysis their impact in protein structure and stability. The smallest cavity (14 A3) has been filled, at two different positions, with a variety of residues and, in all cases, the mutant proteins are locally unfolded, their structure and energetics resembling those of an equilibrium intermediate of the thermal unfolding of the wild-type protein. In contrast, two slightly larger cavities of 20 A3 and 21 A3 have been filled with Val to Ile or Val to Leu mutations and the mutants preserve both the native fold and the equilibrium unfolding mechanism. From the known relationship, observed in shortening mutations, between stability changes and the differential hydrophobicity of the exchanged residues and the volume of the cavities, the filling of these apoflavodoxin cavities is expected to stabilize the protein by approximately 1.5 kcal mol(-1). However, both urea and thermal denaturation analysis reveal much more modest stabilizations, ranging from 0.0 kcal mol(-1) to 0.6 kcal mol(-1), which reflects that the accommodation of single extra methyl groups in small cavities requires some rearrangement, necessarily destabilizing, that lowers the expected theoretical stabilization. As the size of these cavities is representative of that of the typical small, empty cavities found in most proteins, it seems unlikely that filling this type of cavities will give rise to large stabilizations.", "authors": [{"first": "Marta", "middle": [], "last": "Bueno", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Nunilo", "middle": [], "last": "Cremades", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Jos\u00e9", "middle": ["Luis"], "last": "Neira", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Javier", "middle": [], "last": "Sancho", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2006", "venue": "Journal of molecular biology", "journal": "Journal of molecular biology", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "chemicals": ["Flavodoxin", "Urea"], "mesh": [{"term": "Anabaena", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Circular Dichroism", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Computer-Aided Design", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Feasibility Studies", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Flavodoxin", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Models, Molecular", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Mutation", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Protein Denaturation", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Protein Folding", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Temperature", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Urea", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

Although mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has been the material of choice for clot protection, it is easily displaced into the clot during condensation. The present study evaluated the effects of recently introduced calcium silicate cements (Biodentine and TheraCal LC) on the viability and osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) by comparing with MTA Angelus. Cell viability was assessed using XTT assay and flow cytometry. The osteogenic potential of hDPSCs exposed to calcium silicate cements was examined using qRT-PCR for osteogenic gene expressions, alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity, Alizarin red S staining and transmission electron microscopy of extracellular calcium deposits. Parametric statistical methods were employed for analyses of significant difference among groups, with \u03b1=0.05. The cytotoxic effects of Biodentine and TheraCal LC on hDPSCs were time- and concentration-dependent. Osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs was enhanced after exposure to Biodentine that was depleted of its cytotoxic components. This effect was less readily observed in hDPSCs exposed to TheraCal LC, although both cements supported extracellular mineralization better than the positive control (zinc oxide-eugenol-based cement).

Sixty extracted human mandibular first molars were selected for the study and randomly assigned to six groups (n = 10). Group 1 served as the control. In groups 2 through 6, endodontic access and standard MOD cavities were prepared. Following root canal treatment, group 2 was left unrestored. In group 3, the teeth were restored with composite resin (Venus, Heraeus Kulzer). In group 4, flowable composite resin (Venus, Heraeus Kulzer) was used before restoring the teeth with composite resin. In group 5, leno-woven ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene ribbon fiber (Ribbond) was inserted in the flowable resin in a buccal to lingual direction, and the teeth were then restored with composite resin. In group 6, translucent glass fiber (Vectris, Ivoclar) was adapted over the flowable resin in the bucco-lingual direction and restored with composite resin. The specimens were stored in 100% humidity at 37\u00b0C for 1 day. Compressive loading of the teeth was performed using a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The mean load necessary to fracture the samples was recorded in Newtons (N). Data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan's post-hoc test, where significance was set at p < 0.001. The highest and the lowest mean fracture strengths were found in sound teeth (1598.8 N) and unrestored teeth (393.7 N), respectively. The mean load necessary to fracture the samples was 958.6 N in the polyethylene ribbon group (group 5), 913.2 N in the glass-fiber group (group 6), 699.7 N in teeth restored with flowable resin and composite (group 4), and 729.3 N in group 3 with composite resin alone. Statistical analysis showed significantly higher fracture resistance of both the fiber groups compared to composite resin alone (p < 0.001).

The calculated incidence of influenza A in the Finnish army was 515/10000 during the first outbreak and 2066/10000 during the second outbreak. During the 2003-2004 epidemic season, the isolates fell into three groups for their haemagglutinin (HA1) sequences.

Group II viruses, which predominated in Finland during the 2003-2004 season, were characterized by loss of the glycosylation site at position 126 in HA1. The relevance of this loss to the epidemiology is discussed, as well as the frequent appearance of codominant amino acid mixtures at position 151 lining the catalytic cavity of the NA.

There are reasons, therefore, to initiate systematic studies on the alternative procedure known as stepwise excavation. Clinical evaluation of stepwise excavation was performed on 31 deep carious lesions considered to result in pulp perforation by traditional excavation. This study examines the clinical and microbiological alterations during the final excavation performed during long intervals (6-12 months) after the initial treatment that included peripheral dentine excavation and removal of the central cariogenic biomass and the superficial necrotic dentine. The dentine colour and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales before application of a Ca(OH)2 compound and a temporary sealing for 6-12 months. Reassessments were performed before the after final excavation. Microbiological dentine samples were obtained in 19 randomly selected lesions by a sterile bur, transferred to and diluted in reduced transport fluid, and plated on tryptic soy agar. After anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 7 days, total colony-forming units per millilitre were counted from (1) peripheral excavated and hard dentine (control), (2) central demineralized dentine before and final excavation, and (3) central dentine after the final excavation. Six samples of central demineralized dentine were without any cultivable flora increasing to 9 samples after the final excavation. The clinical dentine changes occurring during stepwise excavation were characterized by enhanced hardness of the dentine which was associated with a marked reduction in bacterial growth after the final excavation. Despite the presence of bacteria in the excavated dentine none of the carious lesions resulted in pulp perforation, suggesting that the initial removal of the cariogenic biomass appears to be essential for control of caries progression.

{"pmid": "21891895", "label": 0, "title": "Microleakage of bonded amalgam restorations using different adhesive agents with dye under vacuum: an in vitro study.", "abstract": "In an effort to minimize tooth preparation, yet provide additional retention to compromised tooth structure, bonded amalgam restorations were introduced. Various resin-based adhesives have been tried earlier under bonded amalgam restorations. Still there are controversies regarding the outcome of bonded amalgam restorations regarding their adaptability to the tooth structure and microleakage. Therefore, this study was undertaken to compare the microleakage of bonded amalgam restorations using different adhesive materials. Standard Class I cavities were prepared on occlusal surfaces of 60 human molars. Teeth (n=60) were divided into three groups according to the material employed, as follows: group I: amalgam with glass ionomer cement (GIC) (type I); group II: amalgam with resin cement (Panavia F 2.0) and group III: amalgam with Copalex varnish as a control. Following restoration, the teeth were submitted to thermal cycling. The teeth were subsequently immersed in 2% rhodamine B dye under vacuum for 48 hours and sectioned to allow the assessment of microleakage under stereomicroscope. The values were tabulated and the results were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey's post hoc test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Amalgam with type I GIC showed the least leakage with no statistically significant difference (P value 0.226) when compared to amalgam with Panavia F 2.0 and amalgam with varnish (P value 0.107). It can be concluded that bonded amalgam with type I GIC is a good alternative to amalgam with resin cement (Panavia F 2.0) and amalgam with varnish for large restorations, with the added advantages of GICs. Bonded amalgam restorations prevent over-preparation and reduce the tooth flexure. GIC type I under amalgam provides chemical bonding in between amalgam and tooth structure and thus reduces the microleakage.", "authors": [{"first": "Abhishek", "middle": [], "last": "Parolia", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Kundabala", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Vaibhav", "middle": [], "last": "Gupta", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Mudita", "middle": [], "last": "Verma", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Chandni", "middle": [], "last": "Batra", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Ramya", "middle": [], "last": "Shenoy", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Srikant", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2011", "venue": "Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research", "journal": "Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"], "chemicals": ["Dental Cements", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Glass Ionomer Cements", "Panavia-Fluoro", "Resin Cements", "Rhodamines", "Dental Amalgam", "rhodamine B"], "mesh": [{"term": "Dental Amalgam", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Bonding", "is_major": true, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Cavity Lining", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Cavity Preparation", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Leakage", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Marginal Adaptation", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Prosthesis Retention", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Restoration, Permanent", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Fluorescent Dyes", "is_major": true, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Glass Ionomer Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Materials Testing", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Molar", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Resin Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Rhodamines", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Surface Properties", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Temperature", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Time Factors", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Vacuum", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

Seven multi-purpose dental adhesives were tested with the two methodologies in both amalgam and resin composite restorations. Bond strength was determined with a punch-out method in sections of human molar dentin. Microleakage was analyzed with a digital imaging system (Image-Pro Plus, Version 1.3) to determine the extent of dye penetration in Class V preparations centered at the CEJ on both the buccal and lingual surfaces of human molar teeth. There were 32 treatment groups (n = 10); seven experimental (dental adhesives) and one control (copal varnish, 37% phosphoric acid) followed by restoration with either amalgam or resin composite. Specimens were thermocycled 500 times in 5 degrees and 55 degrees C water with a one-minute dwell time. Bond strength and microleakage values were determined for each group. ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls tests demonstrated an interaction between restorative material and adhesive system with a significant difference among adhesives (p < 0.05).

A cohort of healthy adults requiring a new or replacement restoration in a posterior tooth was recruited in six general practices. All procedures received local Ethics Committee approval. Exclusion criteria included signs and symptoms of pulp necrosis or inflammation, and patients unable to commit to a long-term trial. Cavity preparations were randomized to receive a calcium hydroxide lining or conditioning-and-sealing with a smear-removing bonding system. Choice of bulk restorative material (composite resin or amalgam) was at the discretion of the dentist. The key outcome measure was evidence of pulpal breakdown identified at unscheduled (emergency) or scheduled recall examinations. Postoperative sensitivity was recorded on 100 mm VAS at 24 h, 4 days and 7 days. Pulp status was assessed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 month recall, and at any emergency recall appointment. The relationship between pre-treatment and treatment variables and pulp breakdown was assessed by logistic regression (P = 0.05). A total of 602 teeth were recruited, with comparable numbers of cavities lined (288, 47.8%) or conditioned and sealed (314, 52.2%). The majority (492, 81.7%) were replacement restorations, and amalgam was the most common bulk restorative material (377, 62.6%). A total of 390 (64.8%) restored teeth were reviewed at 6 months, 307 (51%) at 12 months, 363 (60.3%) at 24 months, and 279 (46.3%) at 36 months post-restoration. Sixteen cases of pulp breakdown were identified within 36 months of restoration placement, 11 presenting as emergencies and five detected at routine recall examination. Logistic regression showed that preoperative pain, cavity treatment by lining or conditioning-and-sealing and the use of rubber dam isolation had no association with pulp breakdown. Pulp breakdown was associated with deep or pulpally exposed cavities (P < 0.001, odds ratio 7.8) and with composite rather than amalgam restorations (P = 0.001, odds ratio 2.13). Re-coding to identify teeth with pulp exposures revealed that pulpal exposure was the key determinant of adverse pulp outcomes (P < 0.0001, odds ratio 28.4) and that composite resin restorations were again more likely to be associated with pulp breakdown than amalgam (P = 0.017, odds ratio 3.92). Considered within the context of routine primary dental care: Dentists can be confident that pulps will be equally well protected from post-restorative breakdown up to 36 months by calcium hydroxide lining and conditioning-and-sealing with adhesive resins.

Cavity surfaces were treated with the assigned adhesive/liner according to manufacturer's instructions then restored with amalgam. After storage in saline solution for seven days at 37 degrees C, the specimens were subjected to a push-out test at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The mode of failure was assessed by microscopic analysis of the fracture sites. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan Multiple range tests (a=0.05).

The setting reaction process of the polymeric cements was evaluated by mechanical strength tests, infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis and compared with that of a water-setting calcium phosphate cement. The mechanical strength data were analyzed using ANOVA and Scheff\u00e9's multiple comparisons test. Cements prepared from the mixed powder and 25-30 wt% aqueous solutions of PMVE-Ma had high mechanical strength after 24 h storage in distilled water at 37 degrees C. The hardening mechanism depended on an acid-base reaction between the carboxyl groups of PMVE-Ma and the mixed powder, especially its tetracalcium phosphate component. The formation of hydroxyapatite in the polymeric calcium phosphate cement was not detected and is apparently inhibited as a result of the competing reaction of PMVE-Ma with the mixed powder.

This study evaluated whether Fuji-II glass-ionomer cement is an appropriate adhesive liner in bonded amalgam restorations.

In the first part, we quantitatively assessed the tensile bond strengths as well as the failure modes of amalgam bonded to human dentin, using different adhesive liners. In each group, the flat dentin surface was treated with the assigned adhesive cement with a Teflon mold, followed by condensation of amalgam (Valiant PhD) onto it. Each group's mean tensile bond strengths were recorded and the statistical analysis by one way ANOVA showed no significant differences among groups (p > 0.05). Similar to the fracture patterns of the Amalgambond Plus and Panavia-21 groups, the failure mode of Fuji-II group was predominantly adhesive fracture. In the second part, the fracture strengths of amalgam restored teeth were measured using different adhesive liners. Standard MOD cavities were prepared in each tooth except for the intact tooth group. After treatment with the assigned adhesives or varnish, the cavities were restored with amalgam. Fracture strengths were then measured and the fractured interfaces examined using a scanning electron microscope. The fracture strengths of the intact tooth, Amalgambond Plus, Panavia-21 and Fuji-II groups were significantly higher than those of the Copalite and prepared cavity without restoration groups (p < 0.01).

Transducers of these pathways, such as PIK3CA-mTOR-AKT, MAPK, and ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) could therefore be exploited as possible targets for pharmacological intervention. This study aimed to identify 'druggable' pathways in MPM and to formulate a targeted approach based on the use of commercially available molecules, such as the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. We planned a triple approach based on: i) analysis of immunophenotypes and mutational profiles in a cohort of thoracoscopic MPM samples, ii) in vitro pharmacological assays, ii) in vivo therapeutic approaches on MPM xenografts. No mutations were found in 'hot spot' regions of the mTOR upstream genes (e.g. EGFR, KRAS and PIK3CA). Phosphorylated mTOR and ERM were specifically overexpressed in the analyzed MPM samples. Sorafenib and everolimus combination was effective in mTOR and ERM blockade; exerted synergistic effects on the inhibition of MPM cell proliferation; triggered ROS production and consequent AMPK-p38 mediated-apoptosis. The antitumor activity was displayed when orally administered to MPM-bearing NOD/SCID mice. ERM and mTOR pathways are activated in MPM and 'druggable' by a combination of sorafenib and everolimus. Combination therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy against MPM.", "authors": [{"first": "Ymera", "middle": [], "last": "Pignochino", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Carmine", "middle": [], "last": "Dell'Aglio", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Simona", "middle": [], "last": "Inghilleri", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Michele", "middle": [], "last": "Zorzetto", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Marco", "middle": [], "last": "Basiric\u00f2", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Federica", "middle": [], "last": "Capozzi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Marta", "middle": [], "last": "Canta", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Davide", "middle": [], "last": "Piloni", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Francesca", "middle": [], "last": "Cemmi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Dario", "middle": [], "last": "Sangiolo", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Loretta", "middle": [], "last": "Gammaitoni", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Marco", "middle": [], "last": "Soster", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Serena", "middle": [], "last": "Marchi\u00f2", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Ernesto", "middle": [], "last": "Pozzi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Patrizia", "middle": [], "last": "Morbini", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Maurizio", "middle": [], "last": "Luisetti", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Massimo", "middle": [], "last": "Aglietta", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Giovanni", "middle": [], "last": "Grignani", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Giulia", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Stella", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2015", "venue": "BMC cancer", "journal": "BMC cancer", "outbound_citations": ["10.1053/sonc.2002.30227", "11836664", "10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181834f66", "18758312", "10.1378/chest.109.1.109", "8549169", "10.1056/NEJMra050152", "16221782", "10.1165/rcmb.2007-0460OC", "PMC2574528", "18511708", "10.1074/jbc.M709698200", "PMC2442321", "18339627", "10.1593/neo.101156", "PMC3022424", "21245936", "10.1097/JTO.0000000000000055", "24419422", "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1940", "15788680", "10.1016/j.lungcan.2005.04.010", "15951053", "10.1038/nrm882", "12154370", "10.1038/nrm2866", "PMC2871950", "20308985", "10.1038/nrc1362", "15122205", "10.1038/nm982", "14704791", "10.1007/s10585-006-9033-y", "17028919", "10.1002/ijc.24734", "19588507", "10.1186/1476-4598-8-118", "PMC2804605", "20003259", "10.1016/j.lungcan.2004.04.027", "15261432", "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0668", "PMC3440776", "19372546", "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.02.019", "PMC3326346", "19268526", "10.1002/jcp.10119", "12115731", "10.1097/JTO.0b013e31820e1a25", "21358348", "24378576", "10.1116/1.3582324", "21721837", "10.1073/pnas.96.13.7300", "PMC22080", "10377409", "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2293", "23434734", "10.1038/nchembio.610", "21769098", "10.1200/JCO.2007.14.5482", "18332469", "10.1038/ncb1641", "17891137", "10.1101/gad.189601", "PMC312675", "11316791", "10.1016/j.lungcan.2008.08.014", "18835652"], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "chemicals": ["Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Phenylurea Compounds", "ezrin", "Niacinamide", "Everolimus", "Sorafenib", "MTOR protein, human", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "mesh": [{"term": "Administration, Oral", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Animals", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Cell Line, Tumor", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Drug Synergism", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Everolimus", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Female", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Male", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Mesothelioma", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Mice", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Niacinamide", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Phenylurea Compounds", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Phosphorylation", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Pleural Neoplasms", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Sorafenib", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Treatment Outcome", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

Thereafter the samples were tested to failure in the shear mode. For the microleakage test, standardized class V cavities were prepared in human molars with one cavo margin abutting enamel and another dentine/cementum. Amalgam was condensed into the cavities, pretreated with one of the products mentioned above. In addition two further groups were prepared. One receiving treatment with Polyvar varnish and the other remained untreated as the control. Microleakage was assessed with a reflecting light microscope using I.S.O. criteria and the fracture sites and marginal gaps were examined in a scanning electron microscope. Results indicate that All-Bond 2 and Amalgambond Plus induced similar SBS and Scotchbond Multi-Purpose the weakest. At both enamel and dentine/cementum junctions resin bonding agents reduced microleakage. However, this reduction was greater at the enamel interface than at the other. Varnish allowed the greatest amount of marginal leakage and leakage was similar to the untreated control. Amalgam bonding agents are more effective at preventing marginal leakage at the enamel margin than at the dentine/cementum margin. Cavity varnish is not effective in preventing microleakage around amalgam restorations. There is a correlation between shear bond strength and marginal leakage.

One hundred forty extracted molar teeth were cleaned and mounted. Tooth preparations for complete veneer cast crowns were completed with a chamfer finish line. A mesial surface class II cavity preparation 4 mm wide buccolingually and 2 mm deep was made in each tooth. Seven restorative groups were formed: amalgam/cavity varnish, amalgam/dentinal bonding agent, and composite/dentinal bonding agent, each with dry and contaminated groups, and a seventh group of class II cavity preparations without foundations. Finish lines for crown margins were refined 1.5 mm gingival to the restoration. Artificial crowns were cast in type III gold. Treatment groups were divided into 4 cement groups: dry and contaminated zinc phosphate cement and dry and contaminated resin-reinforced glass ionomer cement. The specimens were thermocycled and immersed in erythrosine B solution for 24 hours. Subsequently, they were rinsed, and their coronal portions were embedded in clear resin. Teeth were sectioned mesiodistally, and standard photomicrographs were made. The microleakage of each restoration and crown was measured. The least foundation microleakage was recorded for amalgam/dentinal bonding agents (ideal group) and composite/dentinal bonding agents (ideal group).

Moderate inflammatory response, disorganization of pulp tissue, as well as, deposition of thin layer of reactionary dentin were observed in group 1 teeth in which the remaining dentin thickness (RDT) was less than 300 microm. These histological findings appear to be related to long resin tags formation and bonding agent diffusion through dentinal tubules. In group 2, slight inflammatory response was observed only in one tooth in which the RDT was 162 microm. In group 3, all the teeth showed normal histological characteristics which were similar to the intact control group. Presence of bacteria was not correlated with the intensity of pulpal response. The patients reported no symptoms during the experiment. Radiographic evaluation showed no periapical pathology for any of the teeth.

Thirty-two first and second maxillary premolars were divided into four groups (n=8). Group 1 had standardised mesio-occlusal-distal (MOD) cavities and served as the control group. Group 2 had endodontic access and root canal treatment through the occlusal floor of the MOD cavity, leaving the axial dentine intact. Group 3 had endodontic access and root canal treatment with the mesial and distal axial dentine removed. Group 4 had endodontic access and root canal treatment with axial dentine removed and a glass ionomer base (GIC). All groups were restored incrementally using a low shrink resin composite. Cuspal deflection was measured using direct current differential transformers (DCDTs), and buccal and palatal strain was measured using strain gauges. Teeth were immersed in 2% methylene blue for 24h, sectioned and scored for leakage and gap formation under light and scanning electron microscopy. Total cuspal deflection was 4.9+/-1.3 microm for the MOD cavity (group 1), 7.8+/-3.3 microm for endodontic access with intact axial dentine (group 2), 12.2+/-2.6 microm for endodontic access without axial dentine (group 3), and 11.1+/-3.8 microm for endodontic access with a GIC base (group 4).

Class V cavity preparations were prepared on 168 freshly extracted premolars or molars. The preparations were placed parallel to and 1.0 mm occlusal to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ). Four groups of 42 teeth each were treated with one of the following adhesive dentin systems: Bond-It, All-Bond 2/Resinomer or a copal varnish (Copalite).

Half of the restorations in each group were thermocycled for 3000 cycles (5 degrees C-37 degrees C-55 degrees C-37 degrees C) with a dwell time of 15 sec at each temperature. The other half were stored in double distilled water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Then all 168 restorations were stained with dye, sectioned and scored for microleakage. Results showed that the adhesive dentin systems reduced microleakage in amalgam restorations compared to copal varnish only in non-thermocycled specimens.

After post space preparation, the Carbon fiber and Glass fiber reinforced posts were cemented with Scotch bond multipurpose plus bonding agent and RelyX adhesive resin cement in the first and second groups respectively. The Cast post and cores were cemented with Zinc Phosphate cement in the third group. Following post- cementation, the preparation was further refined and a rubber base impression was taken for metal-ceramic crowns which was cemented with Zinc Phosphate cement.

Evidence shows that endodontic irrigation with NaOCl decreases dentinal bond quality and could cause coronal leakage. Access cavity sealing before endodontic irrigation is a new restorative approach, referred to as immediate endodontic sealing (IES). The primary aim of this in vitro study was to investigate whether IES improved internal adaptation. The secondary aim was to investigate the influence of the viscosity of the composite used to seal the dentine, on the internal adaptation in both IES and DES groups. Third molars (n= 40) with fully developed apices were used. The teeth were prepared into standard Class II MO cavities, and divided in 4 groups according to the approach, and composite viscosity was used for sealing. Group 1: IES + low viscosity composite; group 2: IES + high viscosity composite; group 3: DES + low viscosity composite; and group 4: DES + high viscosity composite. Samples were then sectioned axially for observation using scanning electron microscopy.

It was performed, through PubMed, a bibliographic search on the international literature of the last 10 years using the following limits: studies in English, in vitro studies, randomized clinical trial, reviews, meta-analysis, guide-lines. Were excluded from the search: descriptive studies, case reports, discussion articles, opinion's leader. From studies results that common surface treatments (silanization, acid etching) are ineffective on zirconia because it has an inert surface without glassy component (on which this surface treatments act primarily), instead the sandblasting at 1atm with aluminium oxide (Al(2)O(3)) results significantly effective for the resulting roughening that increase the surface energy and the wettability of the material. Furthermore it has been shown that zinc phosphate-based cements, Bis-GMA-based and glass-ionomer cements can't guarantee a stable long-term adhesion, instead resin cements containing phosphate monomer 10-methacryloyloxyidecyl-dihyidrogenphosphate (MDP) have shown higher adhesion and stability values than the other cements. In particular, it has seen that bond strength of zirconia copings on dentin, using MDP-based cement, is about 6,9MPa; this value is comparable to that obtained with gold copings cementation. ANALYZED STUDIES HAVE LED TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: sandblasting with aluminium oxide (Al(2)O(3)) is the best surface treatment to improve adhesion between resin cements and zirconia; resin cements containing phosphate ester monomers 10-methacryloyloxyidecyl-dihyidrogenphosphate (MDP) have shown in the studies an higher bond strength and stability after ageing treatment; the best procedure for cementing zirconia restorations results the combination of sandblasting with aluminium oxide (Al(2)O(3)) at 50\u03bcm and MDP-based cements.", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Gargari", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Gloria", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Napoli", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Pujia", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2010", "venue": "ORAL & implantology", "journal": "ORAL & implantology", "outbound_citations": ["15109867", "16388846", "11317401", "17680669", "15119865", "17354094", "9972153", "15986960", "16143382", "16911887", "9627896", "15942616", "11203621", "16427692", "19655531", "15386395", "10863444", "12644802"], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article"], "chemicals": [], "mesh": []}

The teeth were then thermocycled for 1500 cycles (between 5 and 60 \u00b0C) and immersed in dye for 24 hours. Cervical microleakage was measured as the extent of dye penetration. Cocured specimens (groups II and III) showed least microleakage and control specimens (group I) showed maximum microleakage.

It was concluded from the results that ultrathin cocured flowable composite lining specimens improved the marginal sealing with decreased microleakage. In this study, the application of additional flowable composite lining with various thicknesses presented different influences in marginal quality of class II box only composite restorations.

Different fluorine containing glass compositions based on 4.5SiO2-3Al2O3-1.5P2O5-(5-z)CaO-zCaF(2) where z=0-3, were mixed with a commercially available polymer liquid to form glass ionomer cements. The cements were subjected to 27Al, 13C CP/MAS, 29Si, and 31P MAS-NMR analysis. The 27Al spectra showed clearly the formation of six-fold coordinate Al(VI), that may crosslink the carboxyl groups in the poly-acid molecules. A shift towards to more positive values of the carboxyl peak in the 13C CP/MAS-NMR spectra showed clearly the proton dissociation of the carboxyl groups. A shift towards more negative values was observed in the 29Si MAS-NMR spectra, suggesting formation of hydrated silica gel and consequently formation of additional Si-O-Si bonds. 31P MAS-NMR spectra also reflected changes in the coordination state around a PO4(3-) tetrahedron. Increasing the fluorine content of the glasses resulted generally in increased reactivity during setting, due to promoting cross-linking and repolymerisation of the silicate phase, followed by clear changes in the MAS-NMR spectra.

Crown fractures with extensive dentin exposure represent a dominant injury in the permanent dentition. Accepted treatment philosophy is dentin coverage (dental liner and/or dentin bonded restoration) to prevent bacteria penetration into the pulp. Today there is, apart from deep proximal fractures, no evidence that this treatment is necessary to protect the pulp. In case of luxation injuries, the accepted treatment principles appear to be anatomically correct repositioning, stabilization with a splint and sometimes antibiotic coverage. In clinical studies, these principles could not be proven to optimize either periodontal or pulpal healing, the explanation possibly being that both reposition and application of splints in certain cases add extra damage to the pulp and periodontal ligament. In case of root fractures with dislocation, fast and optimal repositioning and rigid long-term splinting (i.e. 3 months) have been considered the principle of treatment. However, a recent clinical study has shown that short-term splinting with a semi-rigid splint appears to optimize fracture healing. In tooth avulsion with subsequent replantation, cleansing of the root surface for contamination and systemic antibiotics has been considered essential for pulp and periodontal healing. These treatment concepts have been derived from experimental studies in animals. However, their importance could not be verified in large clinical studies. Ideally, randomized clinical studies are needed in the future for selected trauma types. The influences of repositioning, splinting and the role of infection and antibiotics should be further investigated. However, for ethical reasons, it will be difficult to perform randomized studies on trauma victims and we will be forced in the future to rely on experimental animal studies supported by clinical observational studies.", "authors": [{"first": "Jens", "middle": ["Ove"], "last": "Andreasen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Eva", "middle": [], "last": "Lauridsen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Frances", "middle": ["Meriam"], "last": "Andreasen", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2010", "venue": "Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for Dental Traumatology", "journal": "Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for Dental Traumatology", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article"], "chemicals": [], "mesh": [{"term": "Cognitive Dissonance", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Leakage", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Pulp Exposure", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Evidence-Based Dentistry", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Periodontal Splints", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Tooth Avulsion", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Tooth Fractures", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Tooth Replantation", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

This in vitro study uses fracture resistance testing to compare eight different transitional restorations in maxillary premolars. Ninety sound maxillary premolars were randomly selected and allocated to nine groups, each comprising 10 teeth. One group remained unrestored and was used as the control. Teeth in the remaining groups were prepared to a standard cavity form using: a copy milling process removing the palatal cusp. Restorations were placed using amalgam with dentin pins and cavity varnish; amalgam with an amalgam bonding agent; resin composite with dentin pins and a dentin bonding agent; resin composite with a dentin bonding agent only; resin-modified glass ionomer with dentin pins; resin-modified glass ionomer cement alone and cermet with dentin pins and cermet alone. Each restored tooth was then subjected to axial loading via a bar contacting the buccal and restored palatal cusps until failure of the restored tooth occurred. The mean load-to-fracture values were statistically compared and the modes of failure recorded. It was found that the choice of restorative material and type of restoration had little effect on the fracture resistance of the restored tooth with the exception of those teeth restored with reinforced glass ionomer cement alone, which exhibited a significantly lower resistance to fracture than the other restored teeth. However, the choice of restorative material/technique did influence the mode of failure. Failure in teeth restored with resin-modified glass ionomer cement alone produced the least damage to the remaining tooth tissue when failure occurred. Consequently, this material may offer the most favorable range of properties for the transitional restoration of extensively broken-down maxillary premolar teeth destined to be crowned.

The nonpolar cavity in the protein interleukin-1\u03b2 has been reported to be filled by water on the basis of some experiments and simulations and to be empty on the basis of others. Here we study the thermodynamics of filling the central nonpolar cavity and the four polar cavities of interleukin-1\u03b2 by molecular dynamics simulation. We use different water models (TIP3P and SPC/E) and protein force fields (amber94 and amber03) to calculate the semigrand partition functions term by term that quantify the hydration equilibria. We consistently find that water in the central nonpolar cavity is thermodynamically unstable, independent of force field and water model. The apparent reason is the relatively small size of the cavity, with a volume less than \u223c80 \u00c5(3). Our results are consistent with the most recent X-ray crystallographic and simulation studies but disagree with an earlier interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments probing protein-water interactions. We show that, at least semiquantitatively, the measured nuclear Overhauser effects indicating the proximity of water to the methyl groups lining the nonpolar cavity can, in all likelihood, be attributed to interactions with buried and surface water molecules near the cavity.

Restored teeth were evaluated for any pulpal complications (subjective symptoms, objective signs or loss of tooth vitality) at 1\u00a0month (baseline), 1\u00a0year, and 2\u00a0years after restoration. After excluding shallow cavities, 31 restorations without GIC lining, and 31 restorations with GIC lining, were placed and recalled at baseline without any pulpal complications. At the 1- and 2-year recalls, six patients who had restorations in group 1, and 13 in group 2, had dropped out. None of the remaining teeth in the two groups exhibited pulpal complications at either recall period, regardless of GIC lining placement. The absence of GIC lining does not increase the risk of pulpal complications in deep occlusal cavities restored with resin-based restorations in either the short or long term.", "authors": [{"first": "Danuchit", "middle": [], "last": "Banomyong", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Harold", "middle": [], "last": "Messer", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2013", "venue": "Journal of investigative and clinical dentistry", "journal": "Journal of investigative and clinical dentistry", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"], "chemicals": ["Adper single bond 2", "Clearfil SE Bond", "Composite Resins", "Dental Cements", "Dental Materials", "Filtek Supreme", "Glass Ionomer Cements", "Pulp Capping and Pulpectomy Agents", "Resin Cements", "Fuji glass-ionomer lining cement"], "mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Adult", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Composite Resins", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Caries", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Cavity Lining", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Cavity Preparation", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Enamel", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Materials", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Pulp", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Pulp Test", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Restoration, Permanent", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dentin", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dentin Sensitivity", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Female", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Follow-Up Studies", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Glass Ionomer Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Male", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Molar", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Pulp Capping and Pulpectomy Agents", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Resin Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Treatment Outcome", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Young Adult", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

Patients who had recently completed orthodontic treatment were randomly assigned to the varnish, film, and control groups. Eligibility criteria included age of 12 to 25\u00a0years, good general health, and at least 1 maxillary anterior tooth with a white spot lesion. The primary outcome was the decrease in the lesion volume of each patient after 6\u00a0months of treatment; fluorescence loss and area were the secondary outcome measures. Randomization was accomplished according to a computer-generated randomization schedule, and allocation concealment was achieved with nontransparent concealed envelopes. Blinding was applicable for the treatments only. The test groups received fluoride varnish or film treatment once a month for 6\u00a0months, and the control group received a placebo treatment. All patients received oral hygiene education and were required to use fluoride toothpaste daily. Quantitative light-induced fluorescence images were taken at baseline and at the 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. A mixed-effects linear model was used to analyze quantitative light-induced fluorescence parameters with confounders integrated into the model. Two hundred forty patients (mean age, 16.9\u00a0years; range, 12-25\u00a0years) with 597 teeth with a white spot lesion were randomized 1:1:1 to the varnish, film, and control groups. Baseline demographics were similar between groups, and 29 patients were lost to follow-up. The primary analysis was carried out on a per-protocol basis involving 72 patients in the control group, 69 patients in the varnish group, and 70 patients in the film group who completed the study. The product of fluorescence loss and lesion area values were statistically associated with time (estimate, -4.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], -5.84 to -3.31; P\u00a0<0.0001), and a significant decrease in the product of fluorescence loss and lesion area was observed in all groups after 6\u00a0months with each treatment. The interaction between group and time in the statistical analysis indicated that the product of fluorescence loss and lesion area values of the 3 groups followed different trends over time. Further pair-wise comparisons showed\u00a0that the decreases in the 2 test groups were significantly greater than those in the control group (varnish vs control: estimate, -11.83; 95% CI, -15.39 to -8.26; P\u00a0<0.0001; film vs control, estimate: -7.72; 95% CI, -11.34 to 4.10; P\u00a0<0.0001) in the analysis for 6\u00a0months. In addition, the decrease in the varnish group was significantly greater than that in the film group (estimate, 4.11; 95% CI, 0.48 to 7.73; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0266) in the analysis for 6\u00a0months. No serious adverse effects associated with the use of the tested varnish, film, or placebo occurred. After removal of the orthodontic brackets, some natural remineralization of white spot lesions occurred, and daily use of fluoride toothpaste may be helpful for this process. However, not all patients experienced this remineralization, and treatment with fluoride varnish or fluoride film induced greater remineralization of white spot lesions. In addition, our results suggest that fluoride varnish may be slightly more effective than fluoride film. However, further similar clinical trials with more patients are needed to definitively determine which fluoride treatment is most effective.

Following standardized protocol access, cleaning and shaping by step back technique and obturation was done using guttapercha and AH plus sealer. Access was sealed with Cavit G and outer root surface was coated with wax and nail varnish. The teeth were separated into crown and root and the root portion was placed in plastic tube containing distilled water for 7days.After incubation, 3mm of gutta-percha was removed below CEJ and 2mm glass ionomer cement base was placed. Grouped into five categories based on the bleaching agent placed in pulp chamber as -group1 (control)-distilled water, group 2-sodium perborate with distilled water , group 3- 30% hydrogen peroxide ,group 4-mixture of sodium perborate and 30% hydrogen peroxide and group 5-10% carbamide peroxide gel. Peroxide leakage was measured after 24hrs using ferrothiocyanate method and optical density using spectrophotometer. Statistical analysis of the data was conducted using ANOVA and multiple comparisons within the groups was done using BONFERRONI method (Post-Hoc tests). The results showed highest peroxide penetration from 30% hydrogen peroxide followed by mixture of sodium perborate with 30% hydrogen peroxide, mixture of sodium perborate with distilled water and least penetration from 10% carbamide peroxide gel.

The treated teeth were restored with base of glass-ionomer cement followed by composite restoration. Pain was recorded every 24\u00a0hours for 7 days after intervention. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were done every 3\u00a0months for 18\u00a0months. The data collected were statistically analyzed. At the end of follow-up, overall success rate was 85% in the pulpotomy group and 87.5% in the root canal treatment group (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05). Significant difference in pain incidence and pain reduction was found between the 2 groups (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), with lower scores reported in the pulpotomy group.

Thirty-nine percent of the restorations had no protective layer (Group 1).

The incidence of postoperative sensitivity showed no significant difference among Groups 1, 2 and 3, but was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 4. The restorations made in shallow and medium depth cavities demonstrated significantly less-postoperative sensitivity than those made in deep cavities. The newer generation dentine-bonding agents showed a significantly lower incidence of postoperative sensitivity than the early generation group.

{"pmid": "26780162", "label": 0, "title": "Pit and fissure sealants versus fluoride varnishes for preventing dental decay in the permanent teeth of children and adolescents.", "abstract": "Most of the detected increment in dental caries among children and adolescents is confined to occlusal surfaces of posterior permanent molars. Dental sealants and fluoride varnishes are much used preventive options for caries. Although the effectiveness of sealants and fluoride varnishes for controlling caries as compared with no intervention has been demonstrated in clinical trials and summarised in systematic reviews, the relative effectiveness of these two interventions remains unclear. This review is an update of one first published in 2006 and last updated in 2010. Primary objective \u2022 To evaluate the relative effectiveness of fissure sealants compared with fluoride varnishes, or fissure sealants together with fluoride varnishes compared with fluoride varnishes alone, for preventing dental caries in the occlusal surfaces of permanent teeth of children and adolescents. Secondary objectives \u2022 To evaluate whether effectiveness is influenced by sealant material type and length of follow-up.\u2022 To document and report on data concerning adverse events associated with sealants and fluoride varnishes. We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 18 December 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 11), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 18 December 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 18 December 2015). We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We placed no restrictions on language or date of publication when searching electronic databases. We screened the reference lists of identified trials and review articles for additional relevant studies. We included randomised controlled trials with at least 12 months of follow-up comparing fissure sealants, or fissure sealants together with fluoride varnishes, versus fluoride varnishes for preventing caries in the occlusal surfaces of permanent premolar or molar teeth, in participants younger than 20 years of age at the start of the study. Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We attempted to contact study authors to obtain missing or unclear information.We grouped and analysed studies on the basis of sealant material type (resin-based sealant and glass ionomer-based sealant: glass ionomer and resin-modified glass ionomer) and different follow-up periods. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for caries or no caries on occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth. For trials with a split-mouth design, we used the Becker-Balagtas odds ratio. For continuous outcomes and data, we used means and standard deviations to obtain mean differences. We presented all measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods.We conducted meta-analysis using the fixed-effect model, as data from only two studies were combined. We had planned to conduct meta-analyses using a random-effects model when more than three trials were included in the meta-analysis. In this review, we included eight trials with 1746 participants (four of the trials were new since the 2010 update). Seven trials (1127 participants) contributed to the analyses, and children involved were five to 10 years of age at the start of the trial. Sealant versus fluoride varnish Resin-based fissure sealants compared with fluoride varnishes Four trials evaluated this comparison (three of them contributing to the analyses). Compared with fluoride varnish, resin-based sealants prevented more caries in first permanent molars at two-year follow-up (two studies in the meta-analysis with pooled odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.94; P value = 0.02; I(2) = 0%; 358 children evaluated). We assessed the body of evidence as low quality. The caries-preventive benefit for sealants was maintained at longer follow-up in one trial at high risk of bias: 26.6% of sealant teeth and 55.8% of fluoride-varnished teeth had developed caries when 75 children were evaluated at nine years of follow-up. Glass ionomer-based sealants compared with fluoride varnishes Three trials evaluated this comparison: one trial with chemically cured glass ionomer and two with resin-modified glass ionomer. Researchers reported similar caries increment between study groups regardless of which glass ionomer material was used in a trial. Study designs were clinically diverse, and meta-analysis could not be conducted. The body of evidence was assessed as of very low quality. Sealant together with fluoride varnish versus fluoride varnish alone One split-mouth trial analysing 92 children at two-year follow-up found a significant difference in favour of resin-based fissure sealant together with fluoride varnish compared with fluoride varnish only (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55). The body of evidence was assessed as low quality. Adverse events Three trials (two with resin-based sealant material and one with resin-modified glass ionomer) reported that no adverse events resulted from use of sealants or fluoride varnishes. The other five studies did not mention adverse events. Currently, scarce and clinically diverse data are available on the comparison of sealants and fluoride varnish applications; therefore it is not possible to draw clear conclusions about possible differences in effectiveness for preventing or controlling dental caries on occlusal surfaces of permanent molars. The conclusions of this updated review remain the same as those of the last update (in 2010). We found some low-quality evidence suggesting the superiority of resin-based fissure sealants over fluoride varnish applications for preventing occlusal caries in permanent molars, and other low-quality evidence for benefits of resin-based sealant and fluoride varnish over fluoride varnish alone. Regarding glass ionomer sealant versus fluoride varnish comparisons, we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low and could draw no conclusions.", "authors": [{"first": "Anneli", "middle": [], "last": "Ahovuo-Saloranta", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Helena", "middle": [], "last": "Forss", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Anne", "middle": [], "last": "Hiiri", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Anne", "middle": [], "last": "Nordblad", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Marjukka", "middle": [], "last": "M\u00e4kel\u00e4", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2016", "venue": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews", "journal": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review", "Systematic Review"], "chemicals": ["Cariostatic Agents", "Fluorides, Topical", "Pit and Fissure Sealants"], "mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Cariostatic Agents", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Child", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Caries", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Fluorides, Topical", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Pit and Fissure Sealants", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

The experiments were performed on 80 vital human teeth from patients ranging in age from 12 to 54 years. The experimental teeth were arbitrarily divided into the following 4 groups. Group CRCS: 20 cases treated with CRCS (Hygienic, Akron, Ohio, USA). Group KEZ: 20 cases treated with Dentalis KEZ (Neo Dental Chemical Products, Tokyo, Japan). Group CE: 20 cases treated with calcium hydroxide eugenol (positive control) Group E: 20 cases treated with pure eugenol (negative control). After local anesthesia, the experimental teeth were isolated with rubber dums or cotton rolls. Following preparation of Black's simple class 1 cavities with a diamond instrument mounted high-speed air turbine, the pulp was intentionally exposed by means of a steel bur mounted electric engine. The cavity and exposed pulp surface were cleaned with saline and dried on absorbent material. Then the experimental materials (agents) were applied to exposed pulp surface. The cavity was lined with gutta-percha temporally stopping, and the remainder was filled with silver amalgam. The teeth were clinically observed at various intervals from immediately to 530 days after treatment and then extracted under local anesthesia and prepared for histopathological study. Decalcified sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. 1) CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS: During the observation period, symptoms occurred in the following: Group CRCS: 4 (20%) out of 20 cases. Group KEZ: 4 (20%) out of 20 cases. Group CE: 6 (30%) out of 20 cases. Group E: None of 20 cases No spontaneous pain was observed in these groups. 2) Clinical evaluations Group: CRCS: 16 cases (80%) were good, 3 cases (15%) were satisfactory, and 1 cases (5%) were failure. Group KEZ: 16 cases (80%) were good, 1 cases (5%) were satisfactory, and 3 cases (15%) were failure. Group CE: 14 cases (70%) were good, 4 cases (20%) were satisfactory, and 2 cases (10%) were failure. Group E: 20 cases (100%) were good. 3) Histopathological observations. Various kinds and degree of pulp changes were occurred in each group. Hyperemia and round-cell infiltration resulting from damage caused by treatment and medicaments were frequent in each group. No suppurative inflammation occurred in group CE. Pulp cicatrization and apposition of dentin on pulp chamber walls were observed frequently in each groups.

This substitution adds two extra cationic residues to the excess of four cationic residues normally lining this cavity. Moo-Penn and colleagues who discovered this hemoglobin, found its oxygen affinity in 0.5 M bis-Tris buffer to be lower than that of Hb A. Their finding conflicted with our prediction that additional cationic groups lining the central cavity would destabilize the T-structure by increased electrostatic repulsion and thereby increase the oxygen affinity. We have, therefore, remeasured the ligand-binding properties of Hb Hinsdale. In chloride-free Hepes buffer, Hb Hinsdale has greatly increased oxygen affinity and lower cooperativity than Hb A. A comparison of the properties of Hb A, Hb Hinsdale, Hb Deer Lodge (beta 2 His-->Arg) and Hb Abruzzo (beta 143 His-->Arg) in 0.05 M Hepes versus 0.05 M bis-Tris buffers shows that very low chloride concentrations can significantly alter cooperativity as well as oxygen affinity. The apparent conflict between the findings of Moo-Penn and colleagues and our prediction arises from the enhanced chloride effects exhibited by Hb Hinsdale. On going from 0.05 M Hepes to 0.05 M bis-Tris at pH 7.0, log P50 values for Hb A and Hb Hinsdale are increased by 0.28 and 1.12, respectively. The Bohr effect, the kinetics of oxygen dissociation, the second-order rate constant of CO binding and the rate of CO recombination after flash photolysis were also determined for Hb Hinsdale.

All cavities were observed under a photoelastic microscope and photoelastic images were recorded at 3 min and 24 h after curing and the shrinkage stresses on the cavity wall were calculated. The polymerization shrinkage(v%) of the three composite resins was measured using bonded discs method and their elastic moduli were measured according to ISO standard. The shrinkage stresses at 3 min and 24 h of the three methods were as follows,A: (4.93 \u00b1 0.28), (5.87 \u00b1 0.40) MPa, B: (4.90 \u00b1 0.30), (5.84 \u00b1 0.33) MPa, and C: (4.76 \u00b1 0.28),(5.83 \u00b1 0.37) MPa.No significant difference was found in results among different groups. The polymerization shrinkage(v%) in group A,B, and C were (2.63 \u00b1 0.04)%, (4.56 \u00b1 0.06)%, and (3.98 \u00b1 0.02)%. The elastic modulus in group A, B, and C were (9.59 \u00b1 0.65), (4.25 \u00b1 0.51), and (5.41 \u00b1 0.79) GPa.

The question that receives the most votes each month forms the subject of a critical appraisal of the relevant literature. Each month a new round of voting takes place to decide which further questions will be reviewed. Dental practitioners and dental care professionals are encouraged to take part in the voting and submit their own questions to be included in the vote by joining the website. The paper below details a summary of the findings of the ninth critical appraisal. In order to address the question raised by dentistry research forum, first a search was conducted for systematic reviews on the topic. There was one systematic review retrieved comparing bonded amalgam restorations versus non-bonded amalgam restorations. However, there was no other systematic review identified assessing the effectiveness of dental liners under amalgam restorations in general. Therefore, a search was conducted for any randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing use of a lining under amalgam restorations versus no lining or RCTs comparing differing lining materials under amalgam against each other. There were eight relevant RCTs identified. Due to the low quality, small sample sizes or lack of adequate reporting of the outcome data, the evidence is inadequate to claim or refute a difference in postoperative sensitivity between different dental liners. Further well-conducted RCTs are needed to answer this question.

Sixty approximal cavities were prepared on mesial and distal surfaces of 30 extracted human third molars. The teeth were randomly assigned into 6 groups of 10 cavities each: (G1) Biodentine, (G2) Fuji II LC as a filling material, (G3) Biodentine as a base + Optibond Solo Plus + silane + Filtek Z250, (G4) as in G3 without silane, (G5) Biodentine as a base + Septobond SE + Filtek Z250, (G6) Fuji II LC as a base + Optibond Solo Plus + Filtek Z250. The materials were applied according to the manufacturers' instructions. Biodentine required no dentin or enamel surface conditioning treatment. The teeth were thermocycled 2500x (5\u00b0C to 55\u00b0C). The specimens were then sealed with a 1-mm window around the marginal interface. Samples were immersed in a 50% w/v silver nitrate solution and exposed to a photo developing solution. The teeth were embedded in resin (Sody 33) and sectioned through the restorations. The silver penetration was directly measured using a light microscope. The results were expressed as ordinal scores from 0 to 3 at cervical, interfacial, and enamel margins. The data were analyzed with the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis, Games Howell, and Wilcoxon signed rank tests (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were found between the 6 groups, neither for the dentin cervical margins nor for cervical lining (Biodentine or Fuji II LC)/resin composite interfaces. Statistically significant differences were observed between G5 (median score = 2.0) and the other groups (median score = 1.0) for the enamel margins. Statistically significant differences were found between enamel and dentin cervical margins in G2 (enamel median score = 1.0; dentin median score = 1.5) and G5 (enamel median score = 2.0; dentin median score = 1.0). Within the limits of this in vitro study, Biodentine as dentin substitute in cervical lining restorations or as a restorative material in approximal cavities when the cervical extent is under the CEJ seems to perform well without any conditioning treatment.

SBC is uncommon and comprises of approximately 1% of all jaw cysts. The lesion is usually discovered incidentally during the first two decades of life. Males are affected slightly more frequently than females. The most common sites of occurrence are the molar and premolar regions of the mandible; maxillary lesions are uncommon. The lesion is usually solitary, radiolucent, well demarcated, and non-expansile. Margins may be scalloped, between vital teeth, and root resorption is rare. A surgical approach to the lesion reveals an empty cavity with serosanguinous fluid. Histologically, the cavity lining consists of a loose connective tissue layer and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Pathogenesis and etiology of SBC are still not clearly understood. It is assumed that the cyst forms following traumatic intra-osseous hemorrhage with subsequent lysis and resorption of the cellular content. Trauma, as the main cause of SBC, is not always conclusive and the origin of the lesion may be multifactorial. Treatment of SBC is by curettage. Intralesional hemorrhage due to either intentional curettage or during exploratory procedure may induce a reparative process. A rare occurrence of SBC in a 71 year old healthy male, referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Outpatient Clinic, Sheba Medical Center by his dentist, because of a large radiolucent lesion in the left mandibular body is reported. The patient received a complete lower denture 3 months earlier. He returned to his dentist with a complaint of local pain and an ulcer under the denture. A panoramic radiograph revealed a large unilocular radiolucent lesion with demarcated borders in the left mandibular body and bone erosion in the upper alveolar border of the lesion Clinical examination showed a deep ulcer in the denture-bearing area of the left posterior alveolar ridge. There was no cortical expansion of the mandible. Incisinal biopsy revealed an empty cavity lined by fibrous connective tissue with no epithelial lining. According to the clinico-radiologic and histologic findings, a diagnosis of a simple bone cyst was made. The incidence of SBC is higher in younger age groups (second decade). Occurrence of the lesion in the elderly is rare with only a few reports in the literature. In the present case, the fact that SBC is asymptomatic, may be responsible for the late discovery of the lesion.", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Dvori", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Shohat", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Taicher", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2006", "venue": "Refu'at ha-peh veha-shinayim (1993)", "journal": "Refu'at ha-peh veha-shinayim (1993)", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Case Reports", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "chemicals": [], "mesh": [{"term": "Aged", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Incidental Findings", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Jaw Cysts", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Male", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Mandibular Diseases", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Radiography, Panoramic", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

Forty Class II cavities with margins extending 1 mm below the cement-enamel junction were prepared in extracted human third molars. In each group except the control group, a lining material of 1-mm thickness was applied to the bottom of the cavity and polymerized before placing the resin composite Herculite XRV Ultra (group A: control; group B: Premise Flowable lining; group C: Herculite XRV Ultra lining; and group D: Optibond FL lining).

Statistical analysis was done using the Shapiro-Wilks test, the analysis of variance test, and Duncan post hoc test at p<0.05. Before loading, the percentages of continuous margins in dentin were superior (p<0.05) for groups C and D (71.1% and 87.2%, respectively) compared to groups A and B (55.7% and 48.3%, respectively). After loading, group D (79.8%) was statistically superior in dentin compared to all of the other groups (43.6%, 35.9%, and 54.4%, respectively). In occlusal enamel, no significant difference was found between groups. The percentage of enamel fractures and the percentage of noncontinuous margins in proximal enamel were high, with no significant difference between liners.

Uterine cavity abnormalities can be a contributing cause of subfertility and recurrent implantation failure. Uterine cavity assessment has been suggested as a routine investigation in the evaluation of subfertile women. Traditionally, hysterosalpingography has been the most commonly used technique in the evaluation of infertility. Transvaginal ultrasound scan allows visualization of the endometrial lining and cavity, and has been used as a screening test for the assessment of uterine cavity. Abnormal uterine findings on a baseline scan can be further evaluated with saline hysterosonography, which is highly sensitive and specific in identifying intrauterine abnormalities. Hysteroscopy is considered as the definitive diagnostic tool to evaluate any abnormality suspected on hysterosalpingography, transvaginal ultrasound scan or saline hysterosonography during routine investigation of infertile patients. Minimally invasive hysteroscopes have minimized the pain experienced by patients during the procedure and made it feasible to use hysteroscopy as a routine outpatient examination. Following recurrent IVF failure there is some evidence of benefit from hysteroscopy in increasing the chance of pregnancy in the subsequent IVF cycle, both in those with abnormal and normal hysteroscopic findings. Various possible mechanisms have been proposed for this beneficial effect, but more randomized controlled trials are needed before its routine use in the general subfertile population can be recommended.", "authors": [{"first": "Jyotsna", "middle": [], "last": "Pundir", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Tarek", "middle": [], "last": "El Toukhy", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2010", "venue": "Women's health (London, England)", "journal": "Women's health (London, England)", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "chemicals": ["Sodium Chloride"], "mesh": [{"term": "Female", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Fertilization in Vitro", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Hysterosalpingography", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Hysteroscopy", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Infertility, Female", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Sodium Chloride", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Ultrasonography", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Uterine Diseases", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Uterus", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

All teeth were single-rooted, single-canal anterior teeth. Base/liner usage differed between each group. The first group of teeth had no liner or base, while a liner was placed in the second group of teeth prior to conditioning and restoration. A base was placed in the third group of cavity preparations and both the base and liner were placed in the fourth group. After preparation, a small diameter bare-end PVC-insulated copper wire was inserted within the root canal of each tooth from the apex to firm contact with the pulp chamber roof. The tooth-wire interface and root surface was sealed and leakage was followed electrochemically for 35 days in 0.9% NaCl solution. All of the teeth leaked to some degree; however, teeth that were restored without liner or base demonstrated the smallest amount of leakage. The greatest leakage was noted in teeth restored with both a base and a liner; teeth restored with only a base showed greater leakage than those restored with only a liner.

The paper gives also an overview of the occurrences of teaching repair in different universities. Furthermore, the paper outlines criteria for decision making when to treat a defect restoration with refurbishment, repair, replacement or no treatment. The database search strategy for resin based composite restoration repair (n=360) and the following hand search (n=95) retrieved 455 potentially eligible studies. After de-duplication, 260 records were examined by the titles and abstracts. 154 studies were excluded and 106 articles were assessed for eligibility by analyzing the full texts. Following the same search and selection process, 42 studies for amalgam repair, 51 studies for cast, inlay or porcelain restoration repair and 8 studies for teaching were assessed for eligibility by analysis of the full texts. Following databases were analyzed: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS and PUBMED. Papers were selected if they met the following criteria: replacement, refurbishment or repair of resin composite restorations or amalgam restorations or inlay, cast restoration or porcelain repair.

{"pmid": "29504326", "label": 0, "title": "Evaluation Of Micro Leakage Of Root Canals Filled With Different Obturation Techniques: An In Vitro Study.", "abstract": "Despite a plethora of studies done comparing different obturation techniques using gutta-percha, there is no consensus as to which obturation technique results in a 'better' sealing of root canal space. Aims of the study are to compare mean apical micro leakage in root canals of extracted teeth obturated with cold laterally compacted gutta-percha and thermoplasticised injectable gutta-percha using calcium hydroxide based sealer. It was an in-vitro experimental study carried out using extracted teeth. After access cavity preparation and canal preparation in 70 teeth, they were randomly divided into 2 groups and filled with two different obturation techniques using Sealapex sealer. Teeth were placed in 2.0% methylene blue solution, sectioned longitudinally, observed under microscope and images were captured using microscope attached camera. Amount of dye penetration was measured in millimetre from apex to most coronal part of dye penetration. Data was analysed using SPSS 20.0. Mean and standard deviation of continuous variables was computed. Independent Sample t- test was applied to compare micro leakage values in the two study groups. Level of significance was kept at 0.05. According to the measurements, obturation with Obtura-II and Sealapex was leakier than the other group, with a mean dye penetration of 1.91\u00b11.15 mm. There was a statistically significant difference in dye penetration among the two groups.. Cold lateral compaction plus Sealapex was the best combination for obturation as it exhibited least microleakage.

Inclusion criteria were randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials or controlled clinical trials comparing fissure sealing with no treatment or another preventive treatment in children up to 14 years of age at the start; the outcome measure was caries increment; the diagnostic criteria had been described; and the follow-up time was at least 2 years. Inclusion decisions were taken and grading of the studies was done independently by two of the authors. The main measure of effect was relative risk reduction. Thirteen studies using resin-based or glass ionomer sealant materials were included in the final analysis. The results showed that most studies were performed during the 1970s and a single application had been utilized. The relative caries risk reduction pooled estimate of resin-based sealants on permanent 1st molars was 33% (relative risk = 0.67; CI = 0.55-0.83). The effect depended on retention of the sealant. In conclusion, the review suggests limited evidence that fissure sealing of 1st permanent molars with resin-based materials has a caries-preventive effect.

Their enzymes are active at cold temperatures by being structurally more flexible than mesophilic enzymes. Even though, there are some indications of the possible structural mechanisms by which psychrophilic enzymes are catalytic active at cold temperatures, there is not a generalized structural property common to all psychrophilic enzymes. We examine twenty homologous enzyme pairs from psychrophiles and mesophiles to investigate flexibility as a key characteristic for cold adaptation. B-factors in protein X-ray structures are one way to measure flexibility. Comparing psychrophilic to mesophilic protein B-factors reveals that psychrophilic enzymes are more flexible in 5-turn and strand secondary structures. Enzyme cavities, identified using CASTp at various probe sizes, indicate that psychrophilic enzymes have larger average cavity sizes at probe radii of 1.4-1.5 \u00c5, sufficient for water molecules.

Sixty single-rooted teeth with mature apices were prepared chemomechanically using a modified double-flared technique with non-cutting tipped files and copious irrigation with 2% sodium hypochlorite. The teeth were randomly allocated to four groups of 15 teeth each. Two groups were treated with 40% citric acid to remove the smear layer.

The teeth were stored for 1 week, thermocycled, and the extent of coronal leakage determined for each group after immersion in Indian ink for 90 h. The teeth were demineralized, dehydrated and immersed in methyl salicylate which rendered them transparent. Linear measurement of dye penetration was recorded. The mean depth (+/- SD) of leakage for the groups in which the smear layer was left intact was 4.26 +/- 1.53 mm and 6.83 +/- 1.65 mm for the Vitrebond and Tubliseal, respectively.

Past investigators compared an etched cement surface with an unetched surface that was set against a smooth surface. Clinically, however, a glassy smooth surface is not produced when the cement is used as a base. Using Scotchbond bonding resin, we developed this two-part study to evaluate the tensile bond strengths of P-30TM composite resin to several glass-ionomer cements that were (a) unetched but allowed to set in air and (b) etched for 30 s with orthophosphoric acid, and to compare them with the cohesive strength of the respective cement. Using a silver nitrate staining technique, we also evaluated the microleakage of class V cavities restored with SiluxTM composite resin under a base of etched or unetched Ketac Bond cement. Although there were significant differences among three cements between their cohesive strength and the resin bond strength after the two surface treatments (p less than 0.01), the bond to the unetched surface was generally similar to that of the etched surface of the cement. The remaining groups showed no statistical difference. The microleakage was similar in the two groups. SEM micrographs showed a rough topography of the unetched cement that resembled that of the etched surface.

The aim was to longitudinally compare the relative effectiveness of the Er:YAG laser, calcium hydroxide and ferric sulphate techniques with dilute formocresol in retaining symptom-free molars. Two hundred primary molars in 107 healthy children were included and randomly allocated to one technique. The treated teeth were blindly reevaluated after 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. Descriptive data analysis and logistic regression analysis accounting for multiple observations per patient by generalised estimating equation were used. Additionally, various influences including tooth type, upper and lower jaws, type of anaesthesia, operator and the final restoration on treatment success were evaluated (Wald chi-square test). After 36 months, the following total (considering clinical and clinically symptom-free radiographic failures) and clinical success rates were determined (in percent): Formocresol 72 (92), laser 73 (89), calcium hydroxide 46 (75), ferric sulphate 76 (97). No significant differences were detected between formocresol and any other technique after 36 months. However, the odds ratio of failure appeared to be three times higher for calcium hydroxide than for formocresol. No significant differences in total success rates were seen regarding the aforementioned influencing clinical parameters. The correct diagnosis of the pulpal status, bleeding control and the specific technique are highly important for long-term success of pulpotomies in primary molars. According to the presented long-term data, pulpotomies using ferric sulphate revealed the best treatment outcome among the used techniques, while calcium hydroxide resulted in the lowest success rates after 3 years. Therefore, we can recommend ferric sulphate for easy and successful treatment of primary molars with caries-exposed pulps.", "authors": [{"first": "Karin", "middle": ["Christine"], "last": "Huth", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Niran", "middle": [], "last": "Hajek-Al-Khatar", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Petra", "middle": [], "last": "Wolf", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Nicoleta", "middle": [], "last": "Ilie", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Reinhard", "middle": [], "last": "Hickel", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Ekaterini", "middle": [], "last": "Paschos", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2012", "venue": "Clinical oral investigations", "journal": "Clinical oral investigations", "outbound_citations": ["11447951", "17714467", "16643542", "20448584", "14709218", "12116328", "8326261", "19836707", "15839391", "11048278", "12927459", "18479381", "18615986", "18554946", "10697342", "17140530", "16304444", "16631836", "1843987", "2161310", "5794116", "11304106", "18634926", "18402097", "11174601", "12723832", "17368330", "17366697"], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "chemicals": ["Composite Resins", "Dental Materials", "Ferric Compounds", "Formocresols", "Glass Ionomer Cements", "Methylmethacrylates", "Pulp Capping and Pulpectomy Agents", "Tetric ceram", "Zinc Oxide-Eugenol Cement", "Ketac-Bond", "formocresol", "ferric sulfate", "IRM cement", "Calcium Hydroxide"], "mesh": [{"term": "Anesthesia, Dental", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Calcium Hydroxide", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Child", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Child, Preschool", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Composite Resins", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Crowns", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Caries", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Cavity Lining", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Materials", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Pulp Exposure", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Restoration Failure", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Restoration, Permanent", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Ferric Compounds", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Follow-Up Studies", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Formocresols", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Glass Ionomer Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Laser Therapy", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Lasers, Solid-State", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Longitudinal Studies", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Methylmethacrylates", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Molar", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Pulp Capping and Pulpectomy Agents", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Pulpotomy", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Single-Blind Method", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Tooth, Deciduous", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Treatment Outcome", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Zinc Oxide-Eugenol Cement", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

According to the ICRP philosophy, these phantoms should be representative of the male and female reference adults with respect to their external dimensions, their organ topology and their organ masses. To meet these requirements, reference models of an adult male and adult female have been constructed at the GSF, based on existing voxel models segmented from tomographic images of two individuals whose body height and weight closely resemble the ICRP Publication 89 reference values. The skeleton is a highly complex structure of the body, composed of cortical bone, trabecular bone, red and yellow bone marrow and endosteum ('bone surfaces' in their older terminology). The skeleton of the reference phantoms consists of 19 individually segmented bones and bone groups. Sub-division of these bones into the above-mentioned constituents would be necessary in order to allow a direct calculation of dose to red bone marrow and endosteum. However, the dimensions of the trabeculae, the cavities containing bone marrow and the endosteum layer lining these cavities are clearly smaller than the resolution of a normal CT scan and, thus, these volumes could not be segmented in the tomographic images. As an attempt to represent the gross spatial distribution of these regions as realistically as possible at the given voxel resolution, 48 individual organ identification numbers were assigned to various parts of the skeleton: every segmented bone was subdivided into an outer shell of cortical bone and a spongious core; in the shafts of the long bones, a medullary cavity was additionally segmented. Using the data from ICRP Publication 89 on elemental tissue composition, from ICRU Report 46 on material mass densities, and from ICRP Publication 70 on the distribution of the red bone marrow among and marrow cellularity in individual bones, individual elemental compositions for these segmented bone regions were derived. Thus, most of the relevant source and target regions of the skeleton were provided.

Despite the fact that the thermal conductivity of the RBC restorative material closely approximates that of natural tooth structure, postoperative hypersensitivity is sometimes still an issue. Dental cavity liners have historically been used to protect the pulp from the toxic effects of some dental restorative materials and to prevent the pain of thermal conductivity by placing an insulating layer between restorative material and the remaining tooth structure. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of using dental cavity liners in the placement of Class I and Class II resin-based composite posterior restorations in permanent teeth in children and adults. Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 25 May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library (searched 25 May 2016), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 25 May 2016), Embase Ovid (1980 to 25 May 2016) and LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database; 1982 to 25 May 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. We included randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of the use of liners under Class I and Class II posterior resin-based composite restorations in permanent teeth (in both adults and children). We included both parallel and split-mouth designs. We utilized standard methodological procedures prescribed by Cochrane for data collection and analysis. Two review authors screened the search results and assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion against the review inclusion criteria. We conducted risk of bias assessments and data extraction independently and in duplicate. Where information was unclear we contacted study authors for clarification. Eight studies, recruiting over 700 participants, compared the use of dental cavity liners to no liners for Class I and Class II resin-based composite restorations.Seven studies evaluated postoperative hypersensitivity measured by various methods. All studies were at unclear or high risk of bias. There was inconsistent evidence regarding postoperative hypersensitivity (either measured using cold response or patient-reported), with a benefit shown at some, but not all, time points (low-quality evidence).Four trials measured restoration longevity. Two of the studies were judged to be at high risk and two at unclear risk of bias. No difference in restoration failure rates were shown at one year follow-up, with no failures reported in either group for three of the four studies; the fourth study had a risk ratio (RR) 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 15.00) (low-quality evidence). Three studies evaluated restoration longevity at two years follow-up and, again, no failures were shown in either group.No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. There is inconsistent, low-quality evidence regarding the difference in postoperative hypersensitivity subsequent to placing a dental cavity liner under Class I and Class II posterior resin-based composite restorations in permanent posterior teeth in adults or children 15 years or older.

PEARL Network practitioner-investigators (P-Is) (n = 28) were trained to assess sensitivity determination, enamel and dentin caries activity rankings, evaluation for sleep bruxism, and materials and techniques used. The P-Is enrolled 341 participants who had hypersensitive posterior lesions. Participants were randomly assigned to receive an RBC restoration with or without an RMGI liner before P-Is applied a one-step, self-etching bonding agent. P-Is conducted sensitivity evaluations at baseline, at one and four weeks after treatment, and at all visits according to patient-reported outcomes. P-Is collected complete data regarding 347 restorations (339 participants) at baseline, with 341 (98 percent) (333 participants) recalled at four weeks. Treatment groups were balanced across baseline characteristics and measures. RBC restorations with or without an RMGI liner had the same one-week and four-week POH outcomes, as measured clinically (by means of cold or air stimulation) and according to patient-reported outcomes.

Starting from user-defined ligand binding sites, eight topological and physicochemical properties are projected from cavity-lining protein residues to an 80 triangle-discretised sphere placed at the centre of the binding site, thus defining a cavity fingerprint. Representing binding site properties onto a discretised sphere presents many advantages: (i) a normalised distance between binding sites of different sizes may be easily derived by summing up the normalised differences between the 8 computed descriptors; (ii) a structural alignment of two proteins is simply done by systematically rotating/translating one mobile sphere around one immobile reference; (iii) a certain degree of fuzziness in the comparison is reached by projecting global amino acid properties (e.g., charge, size, functional groups count, distance to the site centre) independently of local rotameric/tautomeric states of cavity-lining residues. The method was implemented in a new program (SiteAlign) and tested in a number of various scenarios: measuring the distance between 376 related active site pairs, computing the cross-similarity of members of a protein family, predicting the targets of ligands with various promiscuity levels.

The dentin adhesive systems were categorized morphologically into three groups, and an attempt was made to clarify their adhesive mechanism. The first group of products removed the smear layer. The argon-ion bombardment clearly disclosed a hybrid or resin-impregnated dentin layer. It is hypothesized that conditioning with acidic or chelating agents demineralized the dentin surface-layer to a certain depth, leaving behind a collagen-rich mesh-work. Hydrophilic monomers are then believed to alter this collagen-fiber arrangement in a way that facilitates penetration of the adhesive resin, resulting in a mechanical, intermingled link between collagen and the adhesive resin. The second group preserved the smear layer. In this case, the dentinal tubules were obliterated with globular particles at their orifices and remained patent underneath these smear plugs. This type of adhesive system aims at the incorporation of the smear layer into the hydrophilic monomers, which have an affinity for the organic and/or inorganic components of the underlying dentin. Finally, a third, small group only partly dissolved the smear layer, creating a thin resin-impregnated dentin layer and a resin-impregnated smear plug. This study clearly showed that the application of recent adhesive systems induced structural changes in the dentin surface morphology, creating a retentive interface, called the inter-diffusion zone, between the deep, untouched dentin layers and the composite filling material.

The results showed unambiguously that Na+ significantly distorts the symmetry of the channel at the entrance to the selectivity filter (at the residue T75), while K+ does so to a much smaller extent. In all, three ion positions have been calculated: the S4 (lowest) position at the bottom of the selectivity filter, the top of the cavity, and the midpoint of the cavity; Na+ is trapped at the cavity top, while K+ is cosolvated by the selectivity filter carbonyl groups plus threonine hydroxyl groups so that it can traverse the filter. Only one water molecule remains in the K+ solvation shell at the upper position in the cavity; this solvation shell also contains four threonine (T75) hydroxyl oxygens and two backbone carbonyls, while Na+ is solvated by five molecules of water and one oxygen from threonine hydroxyls. T75 at the entrance to the selectivity filter has a key role in recognition of the alkali ion, and T74 has secondary importance. The energetic basis for the preferential bonding of potassium by these residues is briefly discussed, based on additional calculations. Taken together, the results suggest that Na+ would have difficulty entering the cavity, and if it did, it would not be able to enter the selectivity filter.", "authors": [{"first": "Alisher", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Kariev", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Michael", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Green", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2008", "venue": "The journal of physical chemistry.

Pairwise and network meta-analyses were performed. From 113 identified studies, 14 (500 treated lesions) were included. Risk of bias was high or unclear. Based on 11 studies, network meta-analysis found mineral trioxide lining to yield the greatest probability of achieving sterile cavities after a lining/sealing period (73%), followed by antibiotic/disinfectant (8%) and zinc oxide eugenol (7%). Only six studies assessed bacterial reduction after lining/sealing, and zinc oxide eugenol was found to have the highest probability of achieving a bacterial reduction. In both analyses, not providing any lining was found to have low antibacterial effects. Within the limitations of this review and the included studies, certain liners seem more suitable to achieve sterile cavities or reduce bacterial numbers than others. Given the paucity of data and the unclear impact of remaining bacteria on clinical outcomes, further recommendations for specific cavity treatments prior a restoration are not possible.

For example, only a fraction of temozolomide (TMZ) administered systemically is available for therapeutic effect because of the BBB and the instability of TMZ under physiologic conditions. A novel approach to overcome this obstacle is to bypass the BBB and locally deliver chemotherapeutic agents directly to the tumor mass. We have explored the loading of TMZ into a novel hydrogel matrix, which can be delivered in liquid form and then solidifies in situ and releases chemotherapy as the matrix dissolves. Here, we tested the effect of amphiphilic diblock copolypeptide hydrogels (DCHs) of 180-poly-lysine and 20-poly-leucine (K<sub>180</sub>L<sub>20</sub>) on TMZ using Glioblastoma models.

Bitewing radiographs were taken using conventional and digital systems. Subjective analysis was performed for each surface: no restoration; restored teeth; or restored teeth with gap. Based on the given diagnosis, clinical conduct was then indicated. Material radiopacity was determined according to ISO 4049. A Fisher exact test evaluated the influence of the restoratives on the diagnosis. Means were compared using ANOVA and the Games-Howell test. A Friedman test was used to analyze the influence of the systems on the diagnosis, and a binomial test was used to analyze the association between the presence of gaps and the decision to replace the restoration (P = 0.05). For each system, TF+FS was significantly associated with a high percentage of correct diagnoses. The opposite was the case for PLF+FS, which differed from all other groups. Radiographic systems presented similar behaviors, except for NF+FS. Apart from PLF, adequate radiopacity was observed.

Only zinc phosphate cement was found to take up any measurable fluoride after 5 h exposure to the solutions. The zinc oxide filler of the zinc phosphate also failed to take up fluoride from solution. The key interaction for this uptake was thus shown to involve the phosphate groups of the set cement. However, whether this took the form of phosphate/fluoride exchange, or the formation of oxyfluoro-phosphate groups was not clear. Fluoride uptake followed radicaltime kinetics for about 2 h in some cases, but was generally better modelled by the Elovich equation, dq(t)/dt = alpha exp(-betaq(t)). Values for alpha varied from 3.80 to 2.48 x 10(4), and for beta from 7.19 x 10(-3) to 0.1946, though only beta showed any sort of trend, becoming smaller with increasing fluoride concentration. Fluoride was released from the zinc phosphate cements in processes that were diffusion based up to M(t)/M(infinity) of about 0.4.

The activity of a murine (ie, host-specific) interferon-alpha(1) (IFN-alpha(1))-expressing lentiviral vector (mIFN-alpha(1)-LV) was compared with that of a human (h) IFN-alpha(2)b-LV. LVs efficiently delivered the transgene to PEL cells and conferred long-term transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of PEL-injected severe combined immunodeficiency mice with hIFN-alpha(2)b-LV significantly prolonged mice survival and reduced ascites development. Interestingly, mIFN-alpha(1)-LV showed an antineoplastic activity comparable with that observed with hIFN-alpha(2)b-LV. As mIFN-alpha(1) retained species-restricted activity in vitro, it probably acted in vivo on the intracavitary murine milieu. mIFN-alpha(1)-treated murine mesothelial cells were found to express tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and to significantly trigger apoptosis of cocultured PEL cells in a tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-dependent manner.

We developed 3D structural models of PCFT threaded onto the X-ray structures of major facilitator superfamily (MFS) members that were identified as close structural homologues. The model of PCFT threaded onto the glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (GlpT) structure is consistent with detailed accessibility studies in the absence of extracellular substrate and at pH 7.4 presented here, and additionally with a multitude of other mutagenesis and functional studies. Characteristic MFS structural features are preserved in this PCFT model, such as 12 transmembrane helices divided into two pseudosymmetric bundles, and a high density of positive charges on the periphery of the cytoplasmic site that allow interactions with negatively charged lipid head-groups. Under the experimental conditions, PCFT predominantly samples the resting state, which in this case is inward-open. Several positions lining the substrate cavity have been identified. Motif A, a helix-turn-helix motif that is a hallmark of MFS transporters between transmembrane segments II and III is oriented appropriately to interact with residues from transmembrane segments IV as well as XI upon conformational transition to the outward-open state.

Class I cavities were prepared in extracted human molars. The specimens were divided into five groups: For the indirect restorations, the cavity surfaces of the control group were left uncoated (group 1), while the surfaces of the experimental groups were resin coated with a dentin bonding system, Clearfil Protect Bond (PB; groups 2 and 3), or with a combination of PB and a flowable resin composite, Protect Liner F (PLF; group 4).

A combination of PB and PLF showed significantly higher bond strengths compared with the original bond strength of Panavia F and the single use of PB (p < 0.05). However, the highest bond strengths were obtained when PB was used for direct composite restorations (p < 0.05). The application of a resin coating consisting of a self-etching primer dentin bonding system and a flowable resin composite significantly improved the mu-TBS of indirect restorations bonded to dentin using resin cement.

The marginal adaptation was evaluated in terms of 'continuous margin' (CM) at the gingival margin. Ninety class II cavities with margins extending 1mm below the cement-enamel junction were prepared in extracted mandibular third molars. The samples were divided into three groups: no liner placement; 0.5-1mm thick flowable resin liner placement (Filtek Z350 XT flowable resin) on gingival floor and; light cure glass ionomer (Ketac N100) liner. The groups were further subdivided into three sub-groups on the basis of the bonding agents used. Cavities were restored with composite resins (Z350 for Single Bond and Adper Easy Bond; and Synergy D6 Universal, for One Coat Self Etching Bond) in 2mm increments and the samples were mechanically loaded (60N, 1,50,000 cycles). Marginal adaptation was evaluated using a low vacuum scanning electron microscope. Statistical analysis was done with two way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak's correction for multiple comparisons. Placement of flowable composite liner significantly improved the CM values of Single Bond (78\u00b111%) and One Coat Self Etching Bond (77\u00b19%) compared with no liner group, but the values of CM of Adper Easy Bond were not improved (61\u00b112%).

A fluoride-releasing dimethacrylate resin bonding agent (Alloybond) was placed prior to amalgam restoration (Dispersalloy) of the cavity preparations in 10 teeth. Amalgam restorations placed in 10 teeth following copal cavity varnish (Copalite) served as controls. The teeth were thermocycled in synthetic saliva (500 cycles, 5 degrees-50 degrees C), and then coated with an acid-resistant coating, leaving a 1mm rim of sound enamel surrounding the restorations. Artificial secondary caries were created (2.2 mM calcium, 2.2 mM phosphate, 50 mM acetic acid, 0.5 ppm fluoride, pH 3.90). Following lesion formation, longitudinal sections (five per tooth) were prepared for polarized light evaluation. Mean depths for the primary surface lesions were determined using a computer-interfaced digitized tablet. Cavity wall lesion frequencies were also evaluated. Comparisons were made between groups (ANOVA, DMR). Primary surface lesion depth was reduced significantly (P < 0.05) with Alloybond-amalgams (135 +/- 14 microm) when compared with Copalite-amalgams (184 +/- 21 microm).

Occlusal surfaces of mounted teeth were ground flat to expose dentin. Cylindrical specimens (4 mm diameter and 4 mm high) of the restorative materials were bonded to the middle of the cleaned exposed dentin surfaces, according to the manufacturers' instructions. After storing the specimens in 100% humidity at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, shear bond strengths of the restorative materials were measured with an Instron testing machine at crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Two-way analysis of variance and Tukey-B test revealed that Dyract had significantly higher shear bond strength to dentin than Ketac-fil or Vitremer cements, regardless of severity of fluorosis (P <.05).

The objective of this study was to investigate the action of acemannan as a direct pulp-capping material in human primary teeth with deep caries. Forty-two deeply carious mandibular primary molars from 37 children, aged 7-11\u00a0years old diagnosed with reversible pulpitis were studied. After completely removing the infected dentine, teeth with a pinpoint pulpal exposure were randomly divided into two treatment groups: acemannan or calcium hydroxide. A glass-ionomer cement base was applied to all teeth prior to restoration with stainless steel crowns. Clinical and radiographic evaluation was performed 6\u00a0months post-treatment. The teeth due to exfoliate were extracted and histopathologically evaluated for inflammation, dentine bridge formation, and soft tissue organization. At 6\u00a0months, the overall clinical and radiographic success rates of direct pulp capping with acemannan and calcium hydroxide at 6\u00a0months were 72.73 and 70.0\u00a0%, respectively. The histopathological results indicated that the acemannan-treated group had significantly better histopathological responses compared with the calcium hydroxide-treated group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

{"pmid": "26799812", "label": 0, "title": "Caries-Preventive Effect of High-Viscosity Glass Ionomer and Resin-Based Fissure Sealants on Permanent Teeth: A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials.", "abstract": "Glass-ionomers are traditionally regarded to be inferior to resin as fissure sealants in protecting teeth from dental caries, due to their comparatively lower retention rate. Unlike low-viscosity glass-ionomers, high-viscosity glass-ionomer cements (HVGIC) are placed as sealants by pressing the material into pits and fissures with a petroleum-jelly-coated index finger. Hence, HVGIC sealants are assumed to penetrate pits and fissures deeper, resulting in a higher material retention rate, which may increase its caries-preventive effect. The aim of this review was to answer the question as to whether, in patients with fully erupted permanent molar teeth, HVGIC based fissure sealants are less effective to protect against dental carious lesions in occlusal pits and fissures than resin-based fissure sealants? A systematic literature search in eight databases was conducted. Heterogeneity of accepted trials and imprecision of the established evidence were assessed. Extracted sufficiently homogenous datasets were pooled by use of a random-effects meta-analysis. Internal trial validity was evaluated. The protocol of this systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO / Nr.: CRD42015016007). Seven clinical trials were provisionally included for further review. Of these, one was excluded. Seven trial reports reporting on six trials were accepted. From these, 11 datasets were extracted and pooled in four meta-analyses. The results suggest no statistically significant differences after up to 48 months and borderline significant differences in favour of HVGIC sealants after 60 months (RR 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09-0.95; p = 0.04 / RD -0.07; 95% CI: -0.14, -0.01).

The internal trial validity was judged to be low and the bias risk high for all trials. Imprecision of results was considered too high for clinical guidance. It can be concluded that: (i) Inferiority claims against HVGIC in comparison to resin-based sealants as current gold-standard are not supported by the clinical evidence; (ii) The clinical evidence suggests similar caries-preventive efficacy of HVGIC and resin-based sealants after a period of 48 months in permanent molar teeth but remains challenged by high bias risk; (iii) Evidence concerning a possible superiority of HVGIC above resin-based sealants after 60 months is poor (even if the high bias risk is disregarded) due to imprecision and requires corroboration through future research.", "authors": [{"first": "Steffen", "middle": [], "last": "Mickenautsch", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Veerasamy", "middle": [], "last": "Yengopal", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2016", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "outbound_citations": ["14551623", "23543512", "11471968", "15929545", "16127477", "12693821", "12412955", "12412954", "10.1016/j.dental.2011.11.002", "22137936", "9645552", "19776504", "10.1186/1756-0500-4-22", "PMC3041989", "21276215", "10.1590/1679-775720130014", "PMC3881834", "24212996", "16352882", "10.1371/journal.pone.0078397", "PMC3810255", "24205220", "14742648", "8915958", "10728971", "10.1186/1756-0500-4-58", "PMC3060833", "21396097", "PMC4723148", "26799812", "PMC1626481", "17038197", "17408535", "10.1016/j.jclinepi.2011.01.012", "21839614", "10.1186/1472-6831-14-54", "PMC4039987", "24886444", "10.1111/j.1875-595X.2011.00113.x", "PMC9374967", "23016999", "10.1007/s00784-011-0626-8", "22006128", "19341577", "10.1016/S0929-6646(09)60415-0", "19933027", "10.1016/j.dental.2012.01.001", "22300651", "10.1016/j.dental.2014.01.016", "24602520", "10.1177/0022034514535808", "PMC4293722", "24846910", "26116491", "11914306", "11004423", "9645400", "10.1186/1471-2288-14-64", "PMC4023173", "24886043", "10.1186/1471-2288-14-114", "PMC4209086", "25283963"], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"], "chemicals": ["Acrylic Resins", "Glass Ionomer Cements", "Pit and Fissure Sealants", "Resin Cements", "glass ionomer", "Silicon Dioxide"], "mesh": [{"term": "Acrylic Resins", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Child", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Caries", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Female", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Glass Ionomer Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Male", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Pit and Fissure Sealants", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Resin Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Silicon Dioxide", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Tooth", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

The greatest amount of fluoride was released from the uncoated group, followed in ranking by petroleum jelly and varnish coated and the difference among them was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Application of varnish over GIC can severely impede its fluoride release property. Similarly petroleum jelly also impedes the fluoride release, but to a very less extent.

Representatives of two soft polymer groups were analyzed: Vertex Soft NF, a plastified acrylic polymer, and Molloplast B, a silicon elastomer. Vertex Rapid Simplified and Triplex--two acrylic polymers routinely used at the Department of Prosthetic Dentistry were chosen as representatives of rigid acrylic material. The laminar plates of the denture are lined with elastic material to reduce wear discomfort and eliminate symptoms associated with compression of the oral mucosa by the denture. Wear-dependent deterioration in physicochemical, elastic, and microbiological properties presents as prosthetic stomatopathies due to the combined action of mechanical lesions, fungal growth, and toxicity of components of the denture, necessitating replacement of the denture. Samples used in this study were prepared at the Department of Dental Prosthetics, Pomeranian Academy of Medicine. The process of polymerization was carried out strictly as recommended by the manufacturers. The in vitro analyses were done at the Polymer Institute, Technical University of Szczecin, and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pomeranian Academy of Medicine. A special system was used to reproduce conditions in the oral cavity and study their effects on the elastic liners. Samples were placed in the chamber for varying periods, depending on the type of test and material. Thermodynamic analysis was done to confirm proper polymerization and hardening. Time-dependent loss of contact between the elastic liner and rigid denture under tangential (shear) and normal (tear) stress applied to the liner-denture interface was examined. Resistance was studied using INSTRON model 4206-006 universal testing machine. Compressive changes in elastic properties of the soft materials were examined by calculating Young's modulus. Changes in viscoelastic properties of the materials depending on temperature and frequency were followed using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). A precision microbalance from Sartorius (+/- 0.00001 g) was used to measure time-dependent changes in weight and sorption of water. Adhesion of Candida albicans to the rigid and soft acrylic materials was determined after incubation for 3, 6 or 24 h at 37 degrees C. The study has shown that adhesive strength is much greater for acryl-acryl than acryl-silicon interface. Elastic properties of Molloplast B are very stable and superior to those of Vertex Soft NF.

MOD cavities with various widths and depths were prepared on these teeth: Group I, 2((W)) \u00d7 2((D)) mm; Group II, 4((W)) \u00d7 2((D)) mm; Groups III, IIIf, IIIg, 2((W)) \u00d7 4((D)) mm; and Groups IV, IVf, IVg, 4((W)) \u00d7 4((D)) mm. In Groups IIIf and IVf, flowable composite liner was placed prior to composite restoration, while glass-ionomer liner was used in Groups IIIg and IVg. Deformations of restorations resulted from composite shrinkage were recorded for 30 min following light irradiation using a digital-image-correlation (DIC) method to subpixel level. The displacements at the boundaries of the restorations were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and the post hoc test at a 5% significance level. The correlation between the geometric factors and the displacements was also analyzed. The inward displacements on free surfaces were greater than those on the bonded surfaces. Groups with flowable composite linings showed greater amount of displacements on free and bonded surfaces compared to the unlined and glass ionomer lining groups. The correlation analysis showed that the free surface shrinkage was related with the cavity width and C-factor, while cusp deflections were correlated with the cavity depth and the cusp compliance. The DIC technique measures composite shrinkage on different boundaries of restorations to facilitate the investigation of polymerization kinetics. Using flowable composite lining and increased cusp depth may aggravate the cusp flexure.", "authors": [{"first": "Shu-Fen", "middle": [], "last": "Chuang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Chih-Han", "middle": [], "last": "Chang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Terry", "middle": ["Yuan-Fang"], "last": "Chen", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2011", "venue": "Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials", "journal": "Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "chemicals": ["Composite Resins", "Dental Materials", "Dentin-Bonding Agents", "Filtek Flow", "Filtek Z250", "Fuji II LC cement", "Glass Ionomer Cements", "Resins, Synthetic", "flowable hybrid composite", "single bond", "Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate"], "mesh": [{"term": "Acid Etching, Dental", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Chemical Phenomena", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Composite Resins", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Cavity Lining", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Cavity Preparation", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Materials", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Restoration, Permanent", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dentin-Bonding Agents", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Glass Ionomer Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Light-Curing of Dental Adhesives", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Materials Testing", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Polymerization", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Resins, Synthetic", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Surface Properties", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Tooth Crown", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

PAA-CuI nanoparticles were incorporated into glass ionomer (GI), Ionofil Molar AC, and resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI), Vitrebond, at 0.263\u00a0wt%. The antibacterial properties against Streptococcus mutans (n\u00a0=\u00a06/group) and surface micro-hardness (n\u00a0=\u00a05/group) were evaluated. Twenty dentin beams were completely demineralized in 10\u00a0wt% phosphoric acid and equally divided in two groups (n\u00a0=\u00a010/group) for incubation in simulated body fluid (SBF) or SBF containing 1\u00a0mg/ml PAA-CuI. The amount of dry mass loss and hydroxyproline (HYP) released were quantified. Kruskal-Wallis, Student's t test, two-way ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney were used to analyze the antibacterial, micro-hardness, dry mass, and HYP release data, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Addition of PAA-CuI nanoparticles into the glass ionomer matrix yielded significant reduction (99.999\u00a0%) in the concentration of bacteria relative to the control groups. While micro-hardness values of PAA-CuI-doped GI were no different from its control, PAA-CuI-doped RMGI demonstrated significantly higher values than its control. A significant decrease in dry mass weight was shown only for the control beams (10.53\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Significantly less HYP was released from beams incubated in PAA-CuI relative to the control beams (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). PAA-CuI nanoparticles are an effective additive to glass ionomer-based materials as they greatly enhance their antibacterial properties and reduce collagen degradation without an adverse effect on their mechanical properties.

Recently there has been interest regarding the use of bioinspired nanoscale hydroxyapatite (nHA). However, biological apatite is known to be calcium-deficient and carbonate-substituted with a nanoscale platelet-like morphology. Bioinspired nHA has the potential to stimulate optimal bone tissue regeneration due to its similarity to bone and tooth enamel mineral. Many of the methods currently used to fabricate nHA both in the laboratory and commercially, involve lengthy processes and complex equipment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a rapid and reliable method to prepare high quality bioinspired nHA. The rapid mixing method developed was based upon an acid-base reaction involving calcium hydroxide and phosphoric acid. Briefly, a phosphoric acid solution was poured into a calcium hydroxide solution followed by stirring, washing and drying stages. Part of the batch was sintered at 1,000 \u00b0C for 2 h in order to investigate the products' high temperature stability. X-ray diffraction analysis showed the successful formation of HA, which showed thermal decomposition to \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate after high temperature processing, which is typical for calcium-deficient HA. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed the presence of carbonate groups in the precipitated product. The nHA particles had a low aspect ratio with approximate dimensions of 50 x 30 nm, close to the dimensions of biological apatite. The material was also calcium deficient with a Ca:P molar ratio of 1.63, which like biological apatite is lower than the stoichiometric HA ratio of 1.67. This new method is therefore a reliable and far more convenient process for the manufacture of bioinspired nHA, overcoming the need for lengthy titrations and complex equipment. The resulting bioinspired HA product is suitable for use in a wide variety of medical and consumer health applications.", "authors": [{"first": "Caroline", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Wilcock", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Piergiorgio", "middle": [], "last": "Gentile", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Paul", "middle": ["V"], "last": "Hatton", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Cheryl", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Miller", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2017", "venue": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "outbound_citations": ["9429081", "22467406", "15986652", "18394980", "17154577", "11774332", "12221709", "23623113", "15348382", "15747179", "15348752", "15348004", "24094161", "15696277", "20040384", "24411358"], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article", "Video-Audio Media"], "chemicals": ["Biocompatible Materials", "Carbonates", "Durapatite"], "mesh": [{"term": "Biocompatible Materials", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Carbonates", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Durapatite", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "X-Ray Diffraction", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

Material and Methods The materials evaluated were: MTA, Calcium Silicate Cement with zirconium oxide (CSC/ZrO2), and zinc oxide/eugenol (ZOE). Solubility test was performed according to ANSI/ADA. The difference between initial and final mass of the materials was analyzed after immersion in distilled water for 7 and 30 days. Retrograde cavities in human teeth with single straight root canal were performed by using ultrasonic tip CVD 9.5107-8. The cavities were filled with the evaluated materials to evaluate sealing ability using the bacterial leakage test with Enterococcus faecalis. Bacterial leakage was evaluated every 24 hours for six weeks observing the turbidity of Brain Heart infusion (BHI) medium in contact with root apex. Data were submitted to ANOVA followed by Tukey tests (solubility), and Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (sealing ability) at a 5% significance level. Results For the 7-day period, ZOE presented highest solubility when compared with the other groups (p<0.05). For the 30-day period, no difference was observed among the materials. Lower bacterial leakage was observed for MTA and CSC/ZrO2, and both presented better results than ZOE (p<0.05).

Standardized occlusal cavities were prepared in 80 extracted human molars. The preparations were filled with composite resin (1), with composite resin using the incremental technique (2), an experimental glass-fiber-reinforced (3) and polyester-reinforced (4) composite resin, a direct composite inlay (5), a ceramic insert (6), a Cerafil inlay (7), and with an experimental direct filling using Dyract AP compomer (8). Allocation of the teeth to the test groups was randomized; further processing was done on a blind basis. After the preparation of replicas, the teeth were subjected to a thermomechanical cycling process of 2,000 temperature cycles (5 degrees C/55 degrees C) and 50,000 stress cycles (50 N). This was followed by production of a second set of replicas and quantitative margin analysis by SEM (200X). A dye penetration test was then performed on the mesiodistal section. Groups 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 displayed a good primary marginal quality, with the proportion of continuous margins reaching more than 85%. Significantly poorer results were recorded for the experimental glass-fiber-reinforced composite resins and Dyract compomer, where the proportion of perfect margins was only between 36% and 73%. In groups 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, marginal integrity remained stable after the thermomechanical stress cycles, with the Cerafil inlays recording the best values: 89% perfect margins and 3% marginal gaps. In contrast, the experimental composite resins and the compomer underwent a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the proportion of marginal gaps and a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the proportion of continuous margin.

A light-cured hybrid resin composite was used as a control. Twenty extracted human premolars were prepared with standardized Class V cavity outlines on the buccal and lingual surfaces. The occlusal margin of the cavities was on enamel and the gingival margin was on dentin. One bottle adhesive system (Single Bond) was used after etching enamel and dentin with 34.5% phosphoric acid for 15 seconds. The cavities were randomly divided into four groups of 10 each and restored according to the manufacturers' instructions: Group I-Hybrid resin composite (Z100); Group II-Flowable resin composite (Filtek Flow); Group III-Flowable resin composite (Filtek Flow)+Hybrid resin composite (Z100); light cured separately; Group IV-Flowable resin composite (Filtek Flow)+Hybrid resin composite (Z100); co-cured. The samples were thermocycled 200 times with a 30-second dwell time. They were then immersed in a 0.5% basic fuchsin solution for 24 hours, sectioned and analyzed by stereomicroscopy. The degree of dye penetration was recorded and analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. The results of this study indicate that there was no leakage at the occlusal margin for either restoration. Statistically significant differences were found among the groups at the gingival margin. No statistically significant difference was observed between the occlusal and gingival margins except in Group IV.

Aluminum blocks were used to prepare MOD cavities and divided into four groups. A universal hybrid methacrylate-based composite (Z250), a flowable composite (Z350 flowable), and a silorane-based composite (P90) were used to fill the cavities. Cavities were restored using four different filling protocols. Group 1 was filled in bulk with Z250, group 2 was restored by an increment technique with the same composite, group 3 by an increment technique with Z250 and a Z350 flowable lining, and group 4 was restored by an increment technique with P90. The axial shrinkage strain and flexural modulus of the three composites were determined, and cuspal deflection of each group was measured with LVDT probes and compared among groups using ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test (\u03b1=0.05). The axial shrinkage strains of P90, Z250, and Z350 flowable were 1.09 (0.11), 2.29 (0.06), and 4.12 (0.08)%, respectively. The flexural modulus of P90 was 10.1 (0.9), Z250 was 13.6 (2.0), and that of Z350 flowable was 7.6 (0.9) GPa.

Three photoactivation methods using a quartz-tungsten-halogen light were evaluated: continuous light, soft start, and intermittent light. Three lining groups were tested: one or three coats of adhesive, and flowable composite. The stress was measured using a universal testing machine. After the stress measurement, Knoop hardness numbers (KHNs) were evaluated to verify indirectly the degree of conversion of the composite using the three photoactivation methods. The data were submitted to analysis of variance and Tukey's test (p < .05). Intermittent light was always associated with statistically lower stress values when compared with continuous light. Statistical differences were not observed when continuous light and soft start were compared. The use of a flowable composite liner significantly reduced the stress generation when compared with the use of one adhesive coat. The three adhesive coats groups showed intermediate stress values. The hardness test showed no statistical difference between that achieved with continuous light and soft start. These two methods showed statistically higher KHNs when compared with results with intermittent light. Photoactivation using intermittent light may lead to a significant reduction in shrinkage stress levels. This effect could be attributed to a significant reduction of the polymerization rate and/or a decrease in the degree of conversion. The use of a flowable composite liner reduced the stress levels when compared with levels when one coat of adhesive was used.

Stepwise excavation resulted in fewer pulp exposures compared with direct complete excavation [difference: 11.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.2; 21.3)]. At 1 yr of follow-up, there was a statistically significantly higher success rate with stepwise excavation, with success being defined as an unexposed pulp with sustained pulp vitality without apical radiolucency [difference: 11.7%, 95% CI (0.5; 22.5)]. In a subsequent nested trial, 58 patients with exposed pulps were randomized to direct capping or partial pulpotomy.

Trials reporting retention loss or failure (graded bravo-delta in USPHS or similar criteria) were included. Trial selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. Fixed- or random-effects intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and scenario meta-analyses were performed, and trial-sequential-analysis used to control for risk of random errors. Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL) were systematically screened, and hand searches and cross-referencing performed. The ten included trials involved 208 patients (695 cavities) and used chlorhexidine (seven trials), ethanol-wet-bonding (two trials), and quaternary ammonium compounds for degradation inhibition. All but one trial had high risk of bias. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 36 months. Risk of retention loss was not significantly decreased after pretreatment (per-protocol OR [95% CI] 1.37 [0.68/2.77], intention-to-treat: 1.25 [0.76/2.04]).

One hundred and twenty patients, each with a previously untreated tooth requiring an amalgam restoration due to the presence of a carious lesion, were included. Sixty teeth had lesions that were radiographically judged to be located in the middle third of dentin, and another 60 were located in the inner third of dentin. Six different cavity treatment regimens were used: Group 1--no treatment; Group 2--calcium hydroxide liner (Life); Group 3--cavity varnish (Copalite); Group 4--resin modified glass ionomer liner (Vitrebond); Group 5--dentin adhesive resin liner (Single Bond); Group 6--chlorhexidine disinfectant (Consepsis). Patients were telephoned on days 2 and 7 postoperatively and asked whether they experienced sensitivity to cold, and if so, its duration and intensity. If sensitivity remained up to day 7, patients were also contacted on days 30 and 90. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed postoperative sensitivity to be significantly different among cavity treatments at days 2, 7 and 30 (p = 0.026, 0.044, 0.015, respectively). Lesion depth also affected postoperative sensitivity at day 2, with 27% of teeth with middle-third lesions producing pain, and 58% of those with lesions extending to the inner third producing pain (p = 0.000).

Eight low energy docked structures corresponding to different locations and orientations of the candidate molecule are stored at each cavity point giving 80 docked structures overall which are then ranked using an effective free energy function and top five structures are selected. The predicted structure and energetics of the complexes agree quite well with experiment when tested on a data set of 170 protein-ligand complexes with known structures and binding affinities.

The results obtained after application of these materials were compared with the results obtained in patients affected with the similar pathology, where Ca(OH)2 containing liners were not used in treatment process. 54 teeth were selected for the study, among them - 38 molars and 16 premolars. Patients were divided into three groups: I group (21 teeth) included the patients who underwent pulp hyperemia treatment with Life, II group - patients treated with Ultra-Blend (19 teeth) and III group - patients without any pulp protections respectively (13 teeth). It was decided to perform treatment assessment and making appropriate conclusions according to two factors: degree of adhesion of restorations to teeth surfaces and teeth post-restorative sensitivity. Comparison of the obtained data of study and control groups revealed weakening of adhesion between filling and tooth tissues practically in all 3groups, however, with different rate and intensity: in I group on radioography micro cracks were revealed in 10 cases (47.6%), II group -7 (36.5%) cases and treating group - 4 (30.7%) cases, respectively. The obtained results of the current study revealed non-homogenous picture: in I group where Kerr liner was applied - hypersensitivity was revealed in 12 (57.1%) cases, II group - 6 (31.5%) and III group - 7 (53.8%) cases. It is concluded that the primary reason for teeth prolonged and enhanced sensitivity is a micro-percolation factor into the perimeter. But if we admit the application of medical liners in the treatment of pulp hyperemia, doctor's choice should be made on those, providing maximum prevention of further complications. At this stage of the study such features were better revealed by Ultra-Blend. However, the final clinical outcomes - pulp hyperemia disappearance, no complains, production of tertiary dentin and so on - might be expected within a year after the end of the treatment. Currently, it will be interesting to study the pulp chamber condition, evaluation of electrophysiological parameters of the tooth and restoration quality. The mentioned issues will be studied in the future studies.", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Mamaladze", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Ustiashvili", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2013", "venue": "Georgian medical news", "journal": "Georgian medical news", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "chemicals": [], "mesh": [{"term": "Dental Restoration, Permanent", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Pulpitis", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Treatment Outcome", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

One hundred and four class-II cavities in 95 patients were alternatively restored by Superlux Molar and the reference material P-50 APC by 12 general practitioners in 3 public dental health clinics. After 3 years 82 restorations (79%) were available for examination. The restorations were evaluated on the basis of USPHS criteria after 1 week and again after 3 years. Stone casts were used to quantitatively categorize wear in accordance with the Leinfelder method. Color slides and bitewings were taken to supplement the clinical evaluation of color match and marginal adaptation, respectively, and secondary caries. The failure rate (USPHS rating, Charlie) was four restorations of Superlux Molar and seven of P-50 APC. The average wear after 3 years of Superlux Molar was 131 microm and of P-50 APC, 128 microm. There were no statistically significant differences between the two materials with regard to, for example, handling characteristics, anatomic form, color match, marginal discoloration, or failures. A significantly higher wear rate was found after 3 years in patients with a high level of salivary lactobacilli (> 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL at base line) compared with those with lower levels.

The effect of the conditioner was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Significant differences between occlusal and gingival margins were found in all groups (p < 0.05) except B4, D3, and D4. Comparison of preparation methods (groups A-D) revealed significant differences at the occlusal margin in groups 1 and 3, but in all groups at the gingival margin (p < 0.05).

Therefore, the binding preferences of this specific bacterium to structures of carbohydrate origin from more than 120 different acid and nonacid glycolipid fractions were studied. The bacteria were labeled externally with (35)S and used in a chromatogram binding assay. To enable detection of carbohydrate receptor structures for P. gingivalis, the bacterium was exposed to a large number of purified total glycolipid fractions from a variety of organs from different species and different histo-blood groups. P. gingivalis showed a preference for fractions of human and pig origin for adhesion. Both nonacid and acid glycolipids were used by the bacterium, and a preference for shorter sugar chains was noticed. Bacterial binding to human acid glycolipid fractions was mainly obtained in the region of the chromatograms where sulfated carbohydrate chains usually are found. However, the binding pattern to nonacid glycolipid fractions suggests a core chain of lactose bound to the ceramide part as a tentative receptor structure.

Also evaluated was the potential improvement of cavity sealing when utilizing a low charged resin lining for cavity preparations. Seventy recently extracted teeth were randomly allocated to 7 experimental adhesive systems: two 3-step etch and rinse adhesive systems, Scotchbond Multipurpose (SBMP) and Optibond Solo Plus (OS); two 2-step etch and rinse adhesive systems, referred to as \"one-bottle,\" Scotchbond 1 (SB1) and Gluma Comfort Bond + Desensitizer (G); and 3 self-etch \"all-in-one\" adhesives, Adper Prompt-L-Pop (PLP), Xeno III (X-III) and iBond (iB). On each tooth, 2 rectangular cavities were prepared at the cemento-enamel junction: 1 cavity was prepared with adhesive and the hybrid composite and the second was filled with the same adhesive and a thin layer of flowable composite (Filtek Flow) under the resin composite (Z100). All teeth were thermocycled for 800 cycles (5 degrees C-55 degrees C, 30 seconds dwell time). Leakage was evaluated on a 6-point (0-5) severity scale for enamel and dentin on 4 interfaces for each restoration. The results are expressed as means +/- standard deviation (SD). Microleakage scores were analyzed by means of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), assuming an ordinal logistic link function. Covariates in the model were: (1) adhesives, (2) fluid composite and (3) interface. The model also accounts for repeated measurements on the various teeth. The authors found that the mean score of microleakage per tooth was significantly higher at the enamel rather than at the dentin interfaces (1.21 +/- 0.51 and 0.87 +/- 0.48; p<0.0001). In this study, there was no significant difference among the 4 etch and rinse adhesive systems. On the other hand, these adhesives yielded smaller mean scores of microleakage than the 3 self-etch systems (respectively, 0.85 +/- 0.2 and 1.3 +/- 0.5; p<0.0001). Among the self-etch adhesives, microleakage was significantly greater for PLP (1.74 +/- 0.46) than for the other self-etch products (p<0.0001), while X-III, an intermediary strong self-etch, was found to be as good as the etch and rinse systems, with a mean score of 0.97 +/- 0.27. In addition, results have also shown that an under layer of flowable composite significantly improved the water tightness of the PLP adhesive restorations (p=0.042). This in vitro study concluded that the self-etch adhesives remain less effective than etch and rinse. Nevertheless, X-III, a self-etch adhesive, showed acceptable performance in accordance with this study's 6-point severity scale of microleakage, but this needs to be confirmed in further clinical studies.

A search in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases identified 2944 abstracts (published prior to 9/30/2011), of which 485 clinical publications were analyzed in detail. A total of 146 articles included information about sealant retention, with a minimum observation time of 2 years. These publications were analyzed to determine the retention rates of the various materials studied (UV-light-, light- and auto-polymerizing resin-based sealants, fluoride-releasing materials, compomers, flowable composites and glass-ionomer-cement-based sealants). The meta-analysis used random effects models for longitudinal logistic regression and Bayesian statistics. As part of the systematic review, 98 clinical reports and 12 field trial reports were identified. Auto-polymerizing sealants had the longest observation time (up to 20 years) and were found to have a 5-year retention rate of 64.7% (95%CI=57.1-73.1%), which was estimated from the meta-analysis model.

In contrast to these high retention rates, poor retention rates were documented for UV-light-polymerizing materials, compomers and glass-ionomer-cement-based sealants (5-year retention rates were <19.3%). Retention rates for UV-light-polymerizing materials, compomers and glass-ionomer-cement-based sealants were classified as inferior.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in vitro, the effect of a fluoride-releasing cavity varnish on inhibition of enamel demineralization adjacent to orthodontic brackets bonded with RMGI and composite resin cements. Brackets were bonded to 48 extracted human third molars. Half were bonded with a composite resin (Transbond, 3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) and half with an RMGI (Fuji Ortho LC, GC America, Alsip, Ill). Each group was further divided into 2, with half receiving an application of fluoride-releasing varnish (Duraflor, Pharmascience, Montreal, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada). The samples were cycled in an artificial caries solution for an hour twice daily for 31 days. After each caries challenge, the teeth were brushed with a soft toothbrush to simulate normal mechanical wear of the varnish. The loss of fluoride varnish was timed. Teeth were sectioned longitudinally and photographed under polarized light microscopy. Mean lesion depth was measured, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) (P <or=.0001) and the Duncan multiple range test (P <or=.05) indicated significant differences among the groups. Teeth bonded with composite resin showed a 35% reduction in mean lesion depth when fluoride varnish was applied. Teeth bonded with RMGI cement showed no significant differences in lesion depth between varnish and nonvarnish groups. Both RMGI groups had 50% smaller mean lesion depths when compared with the composite resin group without fluoride varnish. Samples bonded with RMGI cement illustrated a wedge effect, with lesion depth shallower near the bracket. A chi-square test showed that the fluoride varnish was lost significantly faster in samples bonded with Fuji Ortho LC (P =.013). Although the fluoride varnish could not prevent demineralization, it appears to be beneficial in reducing lesion formation. Clinicians should consider applying fluoride varnish on areas of enamel that exhibit demineralization or are at risk of demineralization in patients with poor oral hygiene.", "authors": [{"first": "Jason", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Schmit", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Robert", "middle": ["N"], "last": "Staley", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "James", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Wefel", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Michael", "middle": [], "last": "Kanellis", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Jane", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Jakobsen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Peter", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Keenan", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2002", "venue": "American journal of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics : official publication of the American Association of Orthodontists, its constituent societies, and the American Board of Orthodontics", "journal": "American journal of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics : official publication of the American Association of Orthodontists, its constituent societies, and the American Board of Orthodontics", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"], "chemicals": ["Acrylic Resins", "Aluminum Silicates", "Duraflor", "Fluorides, Topical", "Fuji Ortho LC", "Glass Ionomer Cements", "Resin Cements", "Transbond", "Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate"], "mesh": [{"term": "Acrylic Resins", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Aluminum Silicates", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Analysis of Variance", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Dental Bonding", "is_major": true, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Fluorides, Topical", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Glass Ionomer Cements", "is_major": true, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Lacquer", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Linear Models", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Molar", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Orthodontic Brackets", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Paint", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Resin Cements", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Tooth Demineralization", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

Reference points were marked at the mesial cusp ridges of extracted human mandibular molar teeth. Digital images were taken under loading (300 N) using a stereomicroscope (Leica MZ16A; Wetzlar, Germany). Three-dimensional (3D) distances between the reference points were recorded (Leica, Stereo-Explorer, 2.1) as controls. Standard MOD cavities were prepared and restored as follows (n = 10), group 1: composite restoration (Clearfil AP-X; Kuraray, Tokyo, Japan); group 2: cavity lined with polyethylene fibre (Ribbond, Ribbond Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) in combination with flowable resin (Protect-Liner F; Kuraray, Tokyo, Japan) before composite restoration; group 3: polyethylene fibre inserted on occlusal surface of the tooth from buccal to lingual after finishing the composite restoration; group 4: missing walls were restored with composite resin and inner surfaces of the axial walls were then reinforced with polyethylene fibre placed circumferentially before the composite restoration. The restored teeth were re-loaded, digital images were re-taken and the 3D distance between the reference points was recorded in \u03bcm. Comparisons of the restoration techniques, the effectiveness of restoration for each group were analysed statistically (Kruskall-Wallis, paired-samples t-test). The teeth were then loaded until failure (5 mm min(-1) ), the data were recorded (N) and analysed statistically (Kruskall-Wallis test). A significant difference occurred amongst the groups in terms of cusp movement (P = 0.018). All the groups revealed a decrease in inter-cuspal width when compared to their initial records.

This systematic review analyzed the adhesion potential of resin-based and glass-ionomer luting cements to zirconia and aimed to highlight the possible dominant factors affecting the bond strength results to this substrate. Original scientific papers on adhesion to zirconia published in the MEDLINE (PubMed) database between 01/01/1995 and 01/06/2011 were included in this systematic review. The following MeSH terms, search terms, and their combinations were used: \"Dental bonding\", \"Zirconium\", \"Zirconia\", \"Y-TZP\", \"Y-TZP ceramic\", \"Materials Testing/methods\", \"Test\", \"Cement\", and \"Resin bonding\". Two reviewers performed screening and data abstraction. Descriptive statistics were performed and the frequencies of the studied parameters, means, standard deviations, confidence intervals (95% CI; uncorrected and corrected), median values, and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated for the bond strength data reported for different factor levels: surface conditioning methods (control, physicochemical, physical, chemical), cements (bis-GMA-, MDP-, and 4-META-based resin cements, self-adhesive cements, glass ionomer), aging with and without thermocycling (TC), and test methods (macroshear, microshear, macrotensile, and microtensile). The final search provided 177 titles with abstracts. Further abstract screening yielded 72 articles, out of which 54 were found potentially appropriate to be included. After full text evaluation, 2 of these were eliminated. The selection process resulted in the final sample of 52 studies. In total, 169 different surface conditioning methods, mainly combinations of air-abrasion protocols and adhesive promoters (primers or silanes), were investigated. Altogether, the use of 5 types of cements and 4 testing methods was reported. While 26 studies were performed without TC as aging, 26 of them employed thermocycling at varying number of cycles. This review highlighted that adhesion of the luting cements is significantly influenced by the surface conditioning method (p = 0.044), cement type (p = 0.018), test method (p = 0.017) and aging condition (p = 0.003). In nonconditioned control groups without thermocycling, mean bond strength values ranged between 1.15 (IQR = 3.54) and 8.93 (IQR = 9), and 6.9 (IQR = 0) and 8.73 (IQR = 13.93) MPa for macroshear and macrotensile tests, respectively. After physical conditioning method, MDP monomer based cement presented the highest bond values compared to those of other resin cements using either the macrotensile (no TC: 34.2; IQR = 24.18 MPa, TC: 42.35; IQR = 0 MPa) or microtensile (no TC: 37.2; IQR = 41.5 MPa, TC: 17.1; IQR = 31.15 MPa) test method. Based on the results of this systematic review, increased adhesion could be expected after physicochemical conditioning of zirconia. MDP-based resin cements tend to present higher results than those of other cements types when tested using macro- and microtensile tests.

{"pmid": "16741831", "label": 0, "title": "Active site acidic residues and structural analysis of modelled human aromatase: a potential drug target for breast cancer.", "abstract": "This study sheds new light on the role of acidic residues present in the active site cavity of human aromatase. Eight acidic residues (E129, D222, E245, E302, D309, E379, D380 and D476) lining the cavity are identified and studied using comparative modeling, docking, molecular dynamics as well as statistical techniques. The structural environment of these acidic residues is studied to assess the stability of the corresponding carboxylate anions. Results indicate that the environment of the residues E245, E302 and D222 is most suitable for carboxylate ion formation in the uncomplexed form. However, the stability of D309, D222 and D476 anions is seen to increase on complexation to steroidal substrates. In particular, the interaction between D309 and T310, which assists proton transfer, is found to be formed following androgen/nor-androgen complexation. The residue D309 is found to be clamped in the presence of substrate which is not observed in the case of the other residues although they exhibit changes in properties following substrate binding. Information entropic analysis indicates that the residues D309, D222 and D476 have more conformational flexibility compared to E302 and E245 prior to substrate binding. Interaction similar to that between D476 and D309, which is expected to assist androgen aromatization, is proposed between E302 and E245. The inhibition of aromatase activity by 4-hydroxy androstenedione (formestane) is attributed to a critical hydrogen bond formation between the hydroxy moiety and T310/D309 as well as the large distance from D476.

However, up to date, the systematic knowledge about PT domains has been insufficient. In present study, the relationships between sequences, structures and functions of the PT domains were analyzed with 661 NR-PKS sequences. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the PT domains were classified into prominent eight groups (I-VIII) corresponding with the representative compounds and cyclization regioselectivity (C2-C7, C4-C9, and C6-C11). Most of the cavity lining residue (CLR) sites in all groups were common, while the regional CLR site mutations resulted in the appearance of finger-like regions with different orientation. The cavity volumes and shapes, even the catalytic dyad positions of PT domains in different groups were corresponding with characteristic cyclization regioselectivity and compound sizes.

All groups were stored in water at 37 degrees C for 15 days and thermocycled 2500 times, over 8-48 degrees C. The specimens were preloaded five times in compression to 10 kg using a 5 mm-in-diameter, cylindrical steel indenter that contacted the teeth only on the cuspal inclines. Then the teeth were loaded to failure at 5.0 mm/min. The failure mode was recorded (amalgam failure, cusp fracture, or failure at the tooth/amalgam interface). The mean fracture strengths were analyzed using ANOVA and Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons. The Imperva Dual Bond group showed the highest mean forces followed by All-Bond 2 Primer/Bonding Resin. The All-Bond 2 Primer/Liner F and Amalgambond Plus groups demonstrated lower means and were not significantly different from the Copalite group. The Panavia 21 group was in between these two groups and was not statistically different from either group. The mean strength of intact teeth was the highest, but its very large coefficient of variation (60%) prevented effective use of these data for statistical comparison. Analysis of the mode of fracture showed that Panavia 21, All-Bond 2 Primer/Bonding Resin, and Amalgambond Plus failed cohesively in the amalgam in 35%, 25%, and 15% of the specimens respectively.

The scope of this study was to evaluate the antiseptic efficacy of biomechanical preparation and two calcium hydroxide-based pastes, in dogs' teeth with experimentally induced chronic periapical lesions. After initial microbiological sampling, instrumentation of the root canals was undertaken using the conventional technique, using K type files used in conjunction with a solution of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite. After ninety-six hours, further microbiological sampling was undertaken and Calen/CPMC or Calasept pastes were applied for 15 and 30 days. Ninety six hours after the removal of the medication, the third microbiological sampling was undertaken and finally histomicrobiological analysis followed using Brown & Brenn staining. The results were analyzed using the Kruskall-Wallis test, with a level of significance established at 5% (p<0.05). It was shown that the biomechanical preparation significantly reduced the number of colony forming units of microorganisms in root canals. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the antiseptic action of long-term dressings over two periods of action, although 30 days produced a greater reduction in the quantity of microorganisms and of positive microbiological cultures. In histological sections of the four experimental groups, similar microbiological patterns were shown (p>0.05), characterized by an elevated incidence of cocci, bacilli and filaments, predominantly gram-positive, in root canals, secondary canals and accessories, apical cementoplasts and dentinal tubules, but with a low incidence of microorganisms in areas of cementum resorption and the periapical lesion.

Twelve extracted human maxillary premolars were mounted in a universal testing machine at a 35 degrees angle. Cuspal stiffness was determined by applying a load of 75 N to the buccal cusp and recording the displacement of the cusp using inductive displacement transducers. In the same teeth, different cavity preparations and restorations were performed sequentially. Standard MOD cavities were enlarged to allow endodontic access. In addition, the cusps were undermined. Half of the teeth were restored to the level of the previous shallow cavities using conventional glass ionomer cement (Ketac Fil), in the rest of the teeth dentine bonding agent (Syntac) and composite resin (Tetric) were used instead. Finally, composite resin fillings (Tetric) were placed. All restorations were removed and the experiments were repeated twice. For each replication, the assignment of the base materials to the experimental groups was reversed, and ceramic inlays (Empress) were used as final restorations for the last replication. Improvement of cuspal stiffness achieved by conventional glass ionomer bases was very small, whereas composite resin bases increased cuspal stability by more than a factor of two. After placement of the final restorations, however, there was no longer a difference between teeth with different base materials. Nevertheless, composite resin bases might be preferred for two reasons. Firstly, deterioration of adhesive restorations will probably start at the cavosurface margins.

In this work, we explored pathways through which Rieske-type oxygenases evolve to expand their substrate range. BphAE(p4), a variant biphenyl dioxygenase generated from Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 BphAE(LB400) by the double substitution T335A/F336M, and BphAE(RR41), obtained by changing Asn(338), Ile(341), and Leu(409) of BphAE(p4) to Gln(338), Val(341), and Phe(409), metabolize dibenzofuran two and three times faster than BphAE(LB400), respectively. Steady-state kinetic measurements of single- and multiple-substitution mutants of BphAE(LB400) showed that the single T335A and the double N338Q/L409F substitutions contribute significantly to enhanced catalytic activity toward dibenzofuran. Analysis of crystal structures showed that the T335A substitution relieves constraints on a segment lining the catalytic cavity, allowing a significant displacement in response to dibenzofuran binding. The combined N338Q/L409F substitutions alter substrate-induced conformational changes of protein groups involved in subunit assembly and in the chemical steps of the reaction. This suggests a responsive induced fit mechanism that retunes the alignment of protein atoms involved in the chemical steps of the reaction. These enzymes can thus expand their substrate range through mutations that alter the constraints or plasticity of the catalytic cavity to accommodate new substrates or that alter the induced fit mechanism required to achieve proper alignment of reaction-critical atoms or groups.", "authors": [{"first": "Mahmood", "middle": [], "last": "Mohammadi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", "middle": [], "last": "Viger", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Pravindra", "middle": [], "last": "Kumar", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Diane", "middle": [], "last": "Barriault", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Jeffrey", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Bolin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Michel", "middle": [], "last": "Sylvestre", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2011", "venue": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "outbound_citations": ["PMC1820764", "17157819", "9634695", "PMC490896", "15292119", "PMC176551", "8002618", "18685268", "16039530", "PMC194959", "12957885", "21063701", "PMC205943", "1569021", "PMC168606", "9251195", "PMC135170", "12081948", "15342624", "PMC1595510", "16980501", "15342255", "PMC3102011", "21073881", "11312272", "PMC95430", "11514531", "16232495", "PMC1797277", "17142386", "PMC262696", "14617661", "PMC1393203", "16517671", "19616558", "15700128", "PMC95230", "11371517", "1515139", "8757792", "5432063", "8626504", "PMC177406", "7592331", "PMC177515", "7592440", "10777527", "PMC3079973", "21206025", "12586937", "PMC1538779", "16844972", "PMC93582", "10074076", "14660599", "18984016", "17868686", "PMC2665022", "19140736", "PMC94462", "10692370", "16217654", "12427024"], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "chemicals": ["Oxygenases"], "mesh": [{"term": "Burkholderia", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Crystallography, X-Ray", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Kinetics", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Models, Molecular", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Oxygenases", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Substrate Specificity", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

Margins were evaluated before and after thermomechanical loading (TCML) (5000 cycles [+5 degrees C/+55 degrees C], 72.5 N [1,7 Hz]) by quantitative scanning electron microscope analysis using an image analyzing system. Furthermore, microleakage was assessed by dye penetration before and after TCML. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test at the 0.05 level of significance. SEM analysis after TCML showed significantly fewer marginal gaps at the material/dentin interface with VZ (2.2%), DP (7.3%), and PP (6.0%) compared to SZ (29.6%). After TCML, SZ showed significantly more marginal gaps at the material/dentin interface, whereas VZ, DP, and PP were not susceptible to TCML. PP showed the highest percentage in marginal swelling before (18.2%) and after TCML (15.9%), while VZ showed no marginal swelling at all. VZ showed significantly fewer marginal gaps at the composite/hybrid ionomer interface than DP. After TCML there was no significant difference in marginal gaps between the hybrid ionomer/enamel and the hybrid ionomer/dentin interface for both Vitremer and Dyract.

Significantly more leakage was observed in relation to the cervical portions of the cavities (p = 0.00). No significant differences were identified between the leakage scores obtained for the buccal and palatal (lingual) cavities and the different tooth types (p = 0.52 and 0.83, respectively).

From 128 studies, three randomized trials (89/130 patients or teeth), all treating primary teeth, were included. The trials had high risk of bias. All trials compared no lining versus calcium hydroxide lining after selective caries removal followed by adhesive restoration. Follow-up was 36 to 53 months. Restoring the cavity without lining did not significantly affect the risk of failure (intention-to-treat relative risk (RR) (95% confidence interval) 0.71 (0.49-1.04), per-protocol RR 0.52 (0.24-1.10). According to Trial Sequential Analysis, no firm evidence was reached. The quality of evidence was very low. Strong recommendations for using cavity liners are unsubstantiated, but firm evidence for omitting lining is also unavailable. Our findings apply only to primary teeth and calcium hydroxide liner.

Twelve freshly extracted human premolar teeth were used and class V cavities were prepared on the buccal and lingual surfaces of twelve teeth for the experimental groups. Buccal cavities (class V) were prepared on twelve other teeth for the control group. In the control, two coats of cavity varnish was applied as the liner. The experimental groups were lined with freshly mixed luting glass ionomer in twelve buccal cavities and amalgam bond adhesive liner in twelve lingual cavities. The amalgam was then condensed before the liner sets in all the cavities. The teeth were sectioned and mounted on aluminum stubs and then placed in the scanning electron microscope and were observed. The results of the study showed that marginal interface gaps were higher with luting glass ionomer and cavity varnish than with amalgam bond as the liner. The results were statistically not significant. All the three groups were effected by the severe thermal stresses introduced by the microscopy with the glass ionomer cement suffering the worst. The present investigation confirms that glass ionomer cement (type 1) can be effectively used as a bonding agent between amalgam and the tooth when it is painted onto the cavity walls after which the amalgam is condensed immediately, prior to its setting.

Recently, new materials that allow regeneration of residual pulp tissue have been developed. In this study, we compared the preliminary clinical results obtained using Biodentine and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) as pulp-dressing agents in pulpotomies of primary molars. A randomized clinical study was performed in children aged 4-9\u00a0years with at least one primary tooth with decay or caries requiring pulp treatment. A total of 90 primary molars requiring pulpotomy were randomly allocated to the MTA or Biodentine group, and 84 pulpotomies were performed. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were undertaken 6 and 12\u00a0months after treatment. All teeth were restored with a reinforced zinc oxide-eugenol base and stainless steel crowns. Statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test was performed to determine the significant differences between the groups. A total of four clinical failures were observed; all involved gingival inflammation. The clinical success rate in the MTA Group after 12\u00a0months was 92\u00a0% (36/39), whereas the Biodentine Group obtained 97\u00a0% (38/39) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.346). All radiographic failures were observed at the 12-month follow-up evaluation. One molar from MTA Group showed internal resorption obtaining a radiographic success rate of 97\u00a0% (38/39). Two molars from the Biodentine Group showed radiographic failure (1 internal resorption and 1 periradicular radiolucency) obtaining a radiographic success rate of 95\u00a0% (37/39). Biodentine showed similar clinical results as MTA with comparable success rates when used for pulpotomies of primary molars. However, longer follow-up studies are required to confirm our findings.

The teeth were temporized for 1\u00a0week with glass-ionomer (Fuji IX, GC Corp, Tokyo, Japan) and then permanently restored with a composite resin. The subjects were followed up after 1\u00a0week and at six, 12, 24 and 36\u00a0months. The primary outcome was the survival of the capped pulps, and the secondary outcome was postoperative pain after 1\u00a0week. Survival was defined as a nonsymptomatic tooth that responded to sensibility testing and did not exhibit periapical changes on radiograph. At each check-up, the pulp was tested for sensibility and a periapical radiograph was taken (excluding the radiographs taken at the 1-week follow-up). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were used to assess the significant difference in the survival curves between groups. Chi-square test was used to assess the association between the materials and preoperative and postoperative pain. At 36\u00a0months, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a cumulative estimate rate of 85% for the MTA group and 52% for the CH group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006).

Thirty-two intact molars, each prepared with two box-only Class II cavities, were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1, P60 filling alone; Group 2, ultrathin flowable composite lining/co-cured with overlaying composite; Group 3, thin lining/pre-cured and Group 4, thick lining/pre-cured. The teeth were then thermocycled for 1500 cycles (between 5 degrees C and 60 degrees C) and dye immersed for 24 hours. Exterior surface replicas of these restorations were fabricated before and after thermocycling and examined by SEM to evaluate percentages of the five marginal patterns. Data was statistically evaluated using one-way ANOVA test. The teeth were subsequently sectioned longitudinally. The interface microleakage of cervical margin was measured as to the extent of dye penetration. Internal voids were separately recorded in the cervical interface and the cervical and occlusal halves of the restorations. Mann-Whitney test was applied to analyze the interface microleakage and internal voids. Results revealed that replicas of Group 4 presented the highest percentage of marginal openings both before and after thermocycling in SEM examination. Group 2 exhibited superior marginal quality in interface microleakage evaluation compared to the other groups, while Group 4 exhibited the worst. The pre-cured groups (Group 3 and 4) showed significant reduction in interface and cervical voids.

Preparation guidelines were: occlusal reduction of 1.5 to 2 mm, axial reduction of 1.5 mm, and circumferential chamfer preparation placed 0.5 mm subgingivally. Frameworks were fabricated using a computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture technique. All FPDs were cemented with glass-ionomer cement.

Fourteen specimens (3 mm wide x 3 mm long x 2 mm deep) were made for each material. The specimens were randomly divided into two groups and treated as follows: Group A--stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 30 days; Group B--thermal cycled for 5000 cycles (35 degrees C [28s], 15 degrees C [2s], 35 degrees C [28s], 45 degrees C [2s]) and stored for 26.5 days. Hardness and modulus of the materials were determined using depth-sensing microindentation testing with the Instron MicroTester.

{"pmid": "12630343", "label": 0, "title": "[Mesenteric cysts].", "abstract": "Mesenteric cysts and cystic mesenteric tumors are very rare abdominal growths. They may be localized all over the mesentery, from duodenum to rectum, however, they are mostly found in the ileum and right colon mesentery. There are several classifications of these formations, among which the one based on histopathologic features including 6 groups has been most commonly used: 1) cysts of lymphatic origin--lymphatic (hilar cysts) and lymphangiomas; 2) cysts of mesothelial origin--benign or malignant mesothelial cysts; 3) enteric cysts; 4) cysts of urogenital origin; 5) dermoid cysts; and 6) pseudocysts--infectious or traumatic etiology. Two adult female patients treated at the Department of Surgery, Zabok General Hospital, are presented. The diagnosis of mesenteric cyst was based on explorative laparotomy indicated for a cystic abdominal growth and characteristic palpatory finding, US and CT findings. In both patients, the cysts were successfully treated by total cystectomy. Pathohistologic findings pointed to lymphatic cysts. Control US finding at 3 months postoperatively was normal in both patients. Cystic lymphangioma mostly occurs in the first decade of life, with a female predominance. It is usually accompanied by acute abdominal symptomatology. Lymphatic cysts occur later in life (1:100,000 in adults and 1:20,000 in children), also show female predominance, and as a rule are asymptomatic. A mesenteric cyst, especially lymphatic, should be suspected in the presence of painless abdominal tumor, with occasionally painful abdominal pressure, normal laboratory findings, and good general condition in a female patient. In symptomatic cases, acute or chronic abdominal pain is the most common feature, whereas other symptomatology depends on the localization, size and consequential abdominal organ compression (intestinal obstruction, hydronephrosis, lower extremity lymphedema). The term of cystic mesenteric tumor is mostly used to refer to cystic lymphangiomas and lymphatic cysts. In the former, smooth muscle tissue is found, with endothelial lining towards the cavity. The wall of hilar mesenteric cysts does not contain smooth muscle tissue, however, they also show endothelial lining towards the cavity. Exact differentiation between these two entities is necessary for the disease prognosis. Lymphangiomas are prone to recurrence and infiltrating growth. The diagnosis should be made by use of all standard methods of abdominal tumor diagnosis, with ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT), and especially nuclear magnetic resonance providing most information of the growth size and localization. Total cystectomy is the therapeutic method of choice. Open method has been preferred, although reports on successful cystectomy by the laparoscopic method have already appeared in the literature. Intraoperative differentiation between lymphatic cyst and lymphangioma is of utmost importance, and can only be achieved by pathohistologic examination of the cyst wall. If intraoperative biopsy cannot be performed or the finding is uncertain, each cyst should be extirpated in toto due to the above mentioned risk associated with cystic lymphangioma.", "authors": [{"first": "Marijan", "middle": [], "last": "Huis", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Milivoj", "middle": [], "last": "Balija", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Cvjetko", "middle": [], "last": "Lez", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Ferenc", "middle": [], "last": "Szerda", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Mladen", "middle": [], "last": "Stulhofer", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2002", "venue": "Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti", "journal": "Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti", "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Case Reports", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "chemicals": [], "mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Diagnosis, Differential", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Female", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Lymphangioma, Cystic", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Mesenteric Cyst", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Mesentery", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Peritoneal Neoplasms", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

Here, we report a NMR analysis of O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites by O<sub>2</sub>-induced paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) on amide groups of proteins in solution. Outer surface protein A contains a nonglobular single-layer \u03b2-sheet that connects the N- and C-terminal globular domains. Several cavities have been observed in both domains of the crystallized protein structure. The receptor-binding sites are occluded and line the largest cavity of the C-terminal domain. We observed significant O<sub>2</sub>-induced PREs for amide protons located around the largest cavity and at the central \u03b2-sheet. We suggested three potential O<sub>2</sub>-accessible sites in the protein based on the 1/r<sup>6</sup> distance dependence of the PRE. Two sites were in or close to the largest cavity and the third site was in the surface crevice of the central \u03b2-sheet. These results provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence of ligand binding to the surface crevice and cavity of the protein in solution. Because O<sub>2</sub> generally binds more specifically to hydrophobic rather than hydrophilic cavities within a protein, the results also indicated that the receptor-binding sites lining the largest cavity were in the hydrophobic environment in the ground-state conformation. Molecular dynamics simulations permitted the visualization of the rotational and translational motions of O<sub>2</sub> within the largest cavity, egress of O<sub>2</sub> from the cavity, and ingress of O<sub>2</sub> in the surface crevice of the \u03b2-sheet. These molecular dynamics simulation results qualitatively explained the O<sub>2</sub>-induced changes in NMR observations.

Two pairs of fractured specimens of each group were randomly chosen and processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. ANOVA test of the bond strength values showed no statistical differences among the cleaning agents and neither between their interactions with the bonding systems. Upon SEM analysis, most surfaces showed mixed fractures of adhesive and cohesive failures in bonding resin to dentin.

Part of the dose was dissolved in chloroform, followed by fluoride extraction with distilled water. The authors painted the remaining varnish from five predetermined doses from each group onto plastic substrates for examination of fluoride release. Fluoride concentrations in the solutions were measured with a fluoride-selective ion electrode. One-way analysis of variance showed statistically significant differences between varnish groups. The fluoride content was more uniform in Duraphat and CavityShield than it was in Duraflor. The fluoride release profiles in terms of percentage of total fluoride released over time were different among different groups of varnishes and were similar among samples from the same test group. The authors found that Duraflor released consistently more fluoride in artificial saliva than did the other two varnishes. Fluoride content can vary between doses dispensed from the same tube. Uniformity also varies between different varnishes and affects the retention of fluoride in the varnish.

This within-group similarity, represented by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), reduces precision, yielding less statistical power and wider confidence intervals, compared with non-clustered samples of the same size. This must be considered in the design of studies including clusters. We present ICC estimates from a study of 7,826 restorations placed in previously unrestored tooth surfaces of 4,672 patients by 222 clinicians in the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network, as a resource for sample size planning in restorative studies. Our findings suggest that magnitudes of ICCs in practice-based research can be substantial. These can have large effects on precision and the power to detect treatment effects.

Studies were grouped and analysed on the basis of sealant material type (resin-based sealant and glass ionomer-based sealant, glass ionomer and resin-modified glass ionomer) and different follow-up periods. Odds ratio were calculated for caries or no caries on occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth. Mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes and data. Evidence quality was assessed using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods.ResultsEight RCTs involving a total of 1747 children aged five to ten years of age were included. Three trials compared resin-based fissure sealant versus fluoride varnish. Results from two studies (358 children) after two years were combined. Sealants prevented more caries, pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.69 (95%CI; 0.50 to 0.94). One trial with follow-up at four and nine years found that the caries-preventive benefit for sealants was maintained, with 26% of sealed teeth and 55.8% of varnished teeth having developed caries at nine years. Evidence for glass-ionomer sealants was of low quality. One split-mouth trial analysing 92 children at two-year follow-up found a significant difference in favour of resin-based fissure sealant together with fluoride varnish compared with fluoride varnish only (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55). The evidence was assessed as low quality. Three studies assessed but did not report any adverse effects.ConclusionsCurrently, scarce and clinically diverse data are available on the comparison of sealants and fluoride varnish applications; therefore it is not possible to draw clear conclusions about possible differences in effectiveness for preventing or controlling dental caries on occlusal surfaces of permanent molars. The conclusions of this updated review remain the same as those of the last update (in 2010). We found some low quality evidence suggesting the superiority of resin-based fissure sealants over fluoride varnish applications for preventing occlusal caries in permanent molars, and other low-quality evidence for benefits of resin-based sealant and fluoride varnish over fluoride varnish alone. Regarding glass ionomer sealant versus fluoride varnish comparisons, we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low and could draw no conclusions.", "authors": [{"first": "Christopher", "middle": [], "last": "Deery", "suffix": ""}], "year": "2016", "venue": "Evidence-based dentistry", "journal": "Evidence-based dentistry", "outbound_citations": ["23167481", "6584265", "23846772", "23744208", "25656749", "23543512"], "inbound_citations": [], "publication_type": ["Journal Article", "Comment"], "chemicals": ["Fluorides, Topical", "Pit and Fissure Sealants", "Fluorides"], "mesh": [{"term": "Dental Caries", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Fluorides", "is_major": true, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Fluorides, Topical", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Humans", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Paint", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}, {"term": "Pit and Fissure Sealants", "is_major": false, "tree_num": ""}]}

Cavities were restored with composite resin and reopened 60 days later, when other fragments were removed (60-day sample). The dentin morphology (scanning electron microscopy) and mineral content of calcium, phosphorus, and fluorine were assessed. During the follow-up periods (60 days and 10 to 15 months), restorations were evaluated and standardized radiographs were taken. A postprocessing routine was used to identify changes in the radiographic density between periods. After 60 days, the dentin exhibited a better organization, fewer bacteria, and signs of remineralization. The weight percents of calcium and phosphorus were higher 60 days after the cavity sealing, regardless of the group. Higher gray levels of carious and sound dentin were seen on the 10- to 15-month radiographs, irrespective of the group. The success rates of G1 and G2 were 89 percent and 88 percent, respectively.

It is therefore of interest whether dentists perform one- or two-step incomplete excavation, and which criteria and methods they use to assess and provide removal of deep caries. This study investigated the attitudes and behaviour of dentists in northern Germany using a new, validated questionnaire. The survey included 2,346 practitioners, 821 (35%) of whom responded. Demographic and sensitivity analysis did not indicate selection bias. 50% of dentists considered only complete excavation, even if pulp exposure was likely. If caries was to be removed incompletely, 77% considered two-step excavation. Hardness was the most important criterion to assess excavation. To treat an exposed pulp, 75% of dentists considered direct capping, 70% refused incomplete excavation fearing caries progression or pulp damage, and 59% reported to prefer more invasive treatment to facilitate restoration longevity. Over 50% recognised an influence of professional regulations on their treatment decisions. There was a moderate correlation between attitudes and behaviour of dentists, with dentists who suspected residual caries to be harmful rejecting incomplete excavation and vice versa. Cluster analysis identified two groups of dentists with opposite attitudes and behaviour, independently from dentist's age or gender.

The root canals of 50 extracted maxillary single-rooted canine teeth were prepared with the crown-down technique and randomly divided into five groups according to the sealer used: group 1: control group, gutta-percha points only (no sealer); group 2: AH Plus (resin-based sealer); group 3: self-etch Epiphany (resin-based sealer); group 4: Sealer 26 (calcium hydroxide-based sealer); and group 5: Endomethasone (zinc oxide eugenol-based sealer). The root canals were filled with gutta-percha, the cold lateral compaction technique, except for group 3 where Resilon was used. Post spaces were prepared, and fibreglass posts were cemented with the self-adhesive cement RelyX Unicem. Bonded specimens were sectioned into 1-mm-thick slabs, and a push-out test was performed in a universal machine. Failure modes were observed and classified into five types: (i) adhesive between the post and resin cement; (ii) mixed, with resin cement covering 0-50% of the post diameter; (iii) mixed, with resin cement covering 50-100% of the post surface; (iv) adhesive between resin cement and root canal; and (v) cohesive in dentine. Data of bond strength were submitted to anova and Tukey test (\u03b1 = 0.05). No significant difference was detected between control group, AH Plus, Epiphany and Sealer 26 (P > 0.05). The Endomethasone group had significantly lower bond strength values than the other sealers (P < 0.05). The prevalence of mixed fractures and adhesive cement-dentine failure was verified in the eugenol-containing sealer group; in the control group, the resin-based and calcium hydroxide-based sealer groups, the predominant mode of failure was the mixed type.

The root canals of fifty-four human extracted maxillary central incisors were cleaned and shaped using a crown-down technique to a size 40 and filled with gutta-percha and a zinc oxide-eugenol-based sealer using a lateral compaction technique. Teeth were divided into three groups according to the technique used for removing the root filling material: group I - Gates-Glidden burs and stainless steel hand files up to size 50; group II - rotary technique with NiTi Mtwo R files and additional Mtwo files to size 50, 0.04 taper; group III - reciprocating technique with the Reciproc instrument R50, size 50, 0.05 taper. Chloroform was used as a solvent in all groups. Teeth were then split longitudinally and photographed under 8\u00d7 magnification. The images were transferred to a computer, and the total canal space and remaining filling material were quantified. The ratio of remaining filling material to root canal periphery was computed with the aid of Image Tool 3.0 software. The mean percentages of remaining filling material and time required to remove it were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (P < 0.05). The mean percentage of remaining filling material was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in group II, with Mtwo rotary files (12.17%), than in group I, with the hand file technique (7.19%), and group III, with Reciproc instruments (4.57%), which were statistically similar (P > 0.05).

Remaining endodontic filling material was observed on the canal walls of all teeth regardless of the technique used. Hand files combined with Gates-Glidden burs (group I) and the reciprocating technique (group III) removed more filling material from the canal walls than the Mtwo R files.
